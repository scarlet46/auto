A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 Platform and the First 1，000，000 Profiles.,Cell, 2017 Nov 30,29195078,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195078/,We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap)， whereby genes， drugs， and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here， we report more than a 1，000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium， made possible by a new， low-cost， high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible， comparable to RNA sequencing， and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules， functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes， and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here， as well as tools for their analysis， are available at https://clue.io.Keywords:Functional genomics; chemical biology; gene expression profiling.

Transcriptome-wide gene expression outlier analysis pinpoints therapeutic vulnerabilities in colorectal cancer.,Mol Oncol, 2024 Jun,38468448,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38468448/,Multiple strategies are continuously being explored to expand the drug target repertoire in solid tumors. We devised a novel computational workflow for transcriptome-wide gene expression outlier analysis that allows the systematic identification of both overexpression and underexpression events in cancer cells. Here， it was applied to expression values obtained through RNA sequencing in 226 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines that were also characterized by whole-exome sequencing and microarray-based DNA methylation profiling. We found cell models displaying an abnormally high or low expression level for 3533 and 965 genes， respectively. Gene expression abnormalities that have been previously associated with clinically relevant features of CRC cell lines were confirmed. Moreover， by integrating multi-omics data， we identified both genetic and epigenetic alternations underlying outlier expression values. Importantly， our atlas of CRC gene expression outliers can guide the discovery of novel drug targets and biomarkers. As a proof of concept， we found that CRC cell lines lacking expression of the MTAP gene are sensitive to treatment with a PRMT5-MTA inhibitor (MRTX1719). Finally， other tumor types may also benefit from this approach.Keywords:biomarkers; colorectal cancer; drug targets; gene expression outliers.
Genomic and Transcriptomic Determinants of Therapy Resistance and Immune Landscape Evolution during Anti-EGFR Treatment in Colorectal Cancer.,Cancer Cell, 2019 Jul 8,31287991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31287991/,Despite biomarker stratification， the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is only effective against a subgroup of colorectal cancers (CRCs). This genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the cetuximab resistance landscape in 35 RAS wild-type CRCs identified associations of NF1 and non-canonical RAS/RAF aberrations with primary resistance and validated transcriptomic CRC subtypes as non-genetic predictors of benefit. Sixty-four percent of biopsies with acquired resistance harbored no genetic resistance drivers. Most of these had switched from a cetuximab-sensitive transcriptomic subtype at baseline to a fibroblast- and growth factor-rich subtype at progression. Fibroblast-supernatant conferred cetuximab resistance in vitro， confirming a major role for non-genetic resistance through stromal remodeling. Cetuximab treatment increased cytotoxic immune infiltrates and PD-L1 and LAG3 immune checkpoint expression， potentially providing opportunities to treat cetuximab-resistant CRCs with immunotherapy.Keywords:EGFR; cancer evolution; cancer genomics; cancer-associated fibroblasts; cetuximab; colorectal cancer; drug resistance mechanisms; immunotherapy; molecular subtype; predictive biomarker.

Mapping the landscape of genetic dependencies in chordoma.,Nat Commun, 2023 Apr 6,37024492,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37024492/,Identifying the spectrum of genes required for cancer cell survival can reveal essential cancer circuitry and therapeutic targets， but such a map remains incomplete for many cancer types. We apply genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens to map the landscape of selectively essential genes in chordoma， a bone cancer with few validated targets. This approach confirms a known chordoma dependency， TBXT (T; brachyury)， and identifies a range of additional dependencies， including PTPN11， ADAR， PRKRA， LUC7L2， SRRM2， SLC2A1， SLC7A5， FANCM， and THAP1. CDK6， SOX9， and EGFR， genes previously implicated in chordoma biology， are also recovered. We find genomic and transcriptomic features that predict specific dependencies， including interferon-stimulated gene expression， which correlates with ADAR dependence and is elevated in chordoma. Validating the therapeutic relevance of dependencies， small-molecule inhibitors of SHP2， encoded by PTPN11， have potent preclinical efficacy against chordoma. Our results generate an emerging map of chordoma dependencies to enable biological and therapeutic hypotheses.
A comprehensive landscape analysis of autophagy in cancer development and drug resistance.,Front Immunol, 2024 Aug 26,39253092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39253092/,"Background:Autophagy plays important roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance， and the autophagy underlying the tumor pathogenesis and further mechanisms of chemoresistance emergence remains unknown.Methods:In this study， via the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method， an autophagy 45-gene list was identified to evaluate samples' autophagy activity， verified through six GEO datasets with a confirmed autophagy phenotype. It was further utilized to distinguish tumors into autophagy score-high and score-low subtypes， and analyze their transcriptome landscapes， including survival analysis， correlation analysis of autophagy- and resistance-related genes， biological functional enrichment， and immune- and hypoxia-related and genomic heterogeneity comparison， in TCGA pan-cancer datasets. Furthermore， we performed an analysis of autophagy status in breast cancer chemoresistance combined with multiple GEO datasets andin vitroexperiments to validate the mechanisms of potential anticancer drugs for reversing chemoresistance， including CCK-8 cell viability assays， RT-qPCR， and immunofluorescence.Results:The 45-gene list was used to identify autophagy score-high and score-low subtypes and further analyze their multi-dimensional features. We demonstrated that cancer autophagy status correlated with significantly different prognoses， molecular alterations， biological process activations， immunocyte infiltrations， hypoxia statuses， and specific mutational processes. The autophagy score-low subtype displayed a more favorable prognosis compared with the score-high subtype， associated with their immune-activated features， manifested as high immunocyte infiltration， including high CD8+T， Tfh， Treg， NK cells， and tumor-associated macrophages M1/M2. The autophagy score-low subtype also showed a high hypoxia score， and hypoxic tumors showed a significantly differential prognosis in different autophagy statuses. Therefore， ""double-edged"" cell fates triggered by autophagy might be closely correlated with the immune microenvironment and hypoxia induction. Results demonstrated that dysregulated autophagy was involved in many cancers and their therapeutic resistance and that the autophagy was induced by the resistance-reversing drug response， in five breast cancer GEO datasets and validated byin vitroexperiments.In vitro， dihydroartemisinin and artesunate could reverse breast cancer doxorubicin resistance， through inducing autophagy via upregulating LC3B and ATG7.Conclusion:Our study provided a comprehensive landscape of the autophagy-related molecular and tumor microenvironment patterns for cancer progression and resistance， and highlighted the promising potential of drug-induced autophagy in the activation of drug sensitivity and reversal of resistance.Keywords:breast cancer; doxorubicin resistance; immune microenvironment; pan-cancer; tumor resistance."
Comprehensive transcriptome profiling of BET inhibitor-treated HepG2 cells.,PLoS One, 2022 Apr 29,35486664,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486664/,Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and poor prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations play a crucial role in HCC， suggesting epigenetic inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach. Indeed， the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors inhibit the proliferation and invasion of various cancers but still lack a strong mechanistic rationale. Here， we identified the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) in human HCC cell line HepG2 treated with the BET inhibitors， JQ1， OTX015， or ABBV-075. We analyzed the correlation between DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs in common for the three inhibitors based on their expression profiles and performed functional annotation pathway enrichment analysis. Most of these shared DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs， including some novel transcripts， were downregulated， indicating decreased proliferation/adhesion and increased apoptosis/inflammation. Our study suggests that BET proteins play a crucial role in regulating cancer progression-related genes and provide a valuable resource for novel putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC.
Maximizing the Utility of Cancer Transcriptomic Data.,Trends Cancer, 2018 Dec,30470304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30470304/,Transcriptomic profiling has been applied to large numbers of cancer samples， by large-scale consortia， including The Cancer Genome Atlas， International Cancer Genome Consortium， and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Advances in mining cancer transcriptomic data enable us to understand the endless complexity of the cancer transcriptome and thereby to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this paper， we review computational resources for deep mining of transcriptomic data to identify， quantify， and determine the functional effects and clinical utility of transcriptomic events， including noncoding RNAs， post-transcriptional regulation， exogenous RNAs， and transcribed genetic variants. These approaches can be applied to other complex diseases， thereby greatly leveraging the impact of this work.Keywords:cancer transcriptome; exogenous RNA; noncoding RNA; post-transcriptional regulation; transcribed genetic variant.

USP22 promotes development of lung adenocarcinoma through ubiquitination and immunosuppression.,Aging (Albany NY), 2020 Apr 15,32294625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32294625/,Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) expresses highly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)， which are associated with poor overall survival (OS). Microarray processing was performed to determine gene expression profiling， in which it was found that knocking down USP22 resulted in abnormal expression of a large number of genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was organized into 9 functional modules. These functional modules participated significantly in protein modification-related biological process and were involved in cancer-related pathways. The network was constructed to describe the global regulation of USP22-TF/pivot-module-pathway. It suggested that knocking down USP22 may up-regulate the expression of UBC to promote the pathways of cell cycle and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in the development of LUAD. More than that， knocking down USP22 can up-regulate STAT1 to activate JAK1-STAT1-caspase pathway， and promote apoptosis of tumor cell. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that E2F3， H2AFX， TFAP2A， PITX1， IRF7， and FOXM1 may be the potential diagnosis biomarkers for LUAD. On the other hand， BRCA1， FOXM1 and TFAP2A may be prognostic biomarkers of LUAD. In conclusion， we constructed a global regulation network to show that USP22 may promote the development of LUAD through ubiquitination and immunosuppression.Keywords:STAT1; UBC; USP22; global regulation network; lung adenocarcinoma.
Efficient Parameter Estimation Enables the Prediction of Drug Response Using a Mechanistic Pan-Cancer Pathway Model.,Cell Syst, 2018 Dec 26,30503647,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30503647/,Mechanistic models are essential to deepen the understanding of complex diseases at the molecular level. Nowadays， high-throughput molecular and phenotypic characterizations are possible， but the integration of such data with prior knowledge on signaling pathways is limited by the availability of scalable computational methods. Here， we present a computational framework for the parameterization of large-scale mechanistic models and its application to the prediction of drug response of cancer cell lines from exome and transcriptome sequencing data. This framework is over 104times faster than state-of-the-art methods， which enables modeling at previously infeasible scales. By applying the framework to a model describing major cancer-associated pathways (>1，200 species and >2，600 reactions)， we could predict the effect of drug combinations from single drug data. This is the first integration of high-throughput datasets using large-scale mechanistic models. We anticipate this to be the starting point for development of more comprehensive models allowing a deeper mechanistic insight.Keywords:biomarker; cancer signaling; drug response; drug synergy; mechanistic modeling; parameter estimation; sequencing data; systems biology.
Transcriptome analysis uncovers the key pathways and candidate genes related to the treatment of Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces with the repurposed drug pyronaridine.,BMC Genomics, 2021 Jul 13,34256697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34256697/,Background:Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a life-threatening zoonosis caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. Our previous study showed that an approved drug pyronaridine (PND) is highly effective against CE， both in vitro and in an animal model. To identify possible target genes， transcriptome analysis was performed with E. granulosus sensu stricto protoscoleces treated with PND.Results:A total of 1，321 genes were differentially expressed in protoscoleces treated with PND， including 541 upregulated and 780 downregulated genes. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses revealed that the spliceosome， mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were the top three enriched pathways. Western blot analysis showed that PND treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in protein expression levels of EgMKK1 (MKK3/6-like) and EgMKK2 (MEK1/2-like)， two members of MAPK cascades. Interestingly， several heat shock protein (HSP) genes were greatly downregulated including stress-inducible HSPs and their constitutive cognates， and some of them belong to Echinococcus-specific expansion of HSP70.Conclusions:PND has a great impact on the spliceosome， MAPK pathway and ABC transporters， which may underline the mechanisms by which PND kills E. granulosus protoscoleces. In addition， PND downregulates HSPs expression， suggesting a close relationship between the drug and HSPs.Keywords:ABC transporter; Echinococcus granulosus; Heat shock protein; MAPK; Protoscoleces; RNA sequencing; pyronaridine.
Interindividual variability in gene expression profiles in human hepatocytes and comparison with HepaRG cells.,Drug Metab Dispos, 2012 Jan,21994436,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21994436/,Interindividual variations in functions other than drug metabolism activity， remain poorly elucidated in human liver. In the present study， the whole transcriptome of several human hepatocyte populations and the differentiated human HepaRG cell line have been analyzed and compared， using oligonucleotide pangenomic microarrays. We show that， although the variation in the percentages of expressed genes did not exceed 14% among the primary human hepatocyte populations， huge interindividual differences in the transcript levels of many genes were observed. These genes were related to various functions; in addition to drug metabolism， they mainly concerned carbohydrate， amino acid， and lipid metabolism. HepaRG cells expressed from 81 to 92% of the genes active in human hepatocytes and， in addition， a specific gene subset mainly related to their transformed status， some chromosomal abnormalities， and the presence of primitive biliary epithelial cells. Of interest， a relationship was evidenced between abnormal basal expression levels of some target genes and their corresponding previously reported fold changes in one of four human hepatocyte populations treated with the hepatotoxic drug troglitazone and not with other nonhepatotoxic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (PLoS One 6:e18816， 2011). Taken together， our results support the view that HepaRG cells express most of the genes active in primary human hepatocytes and show that expression of most human hepatic genes can quantitatively greatly vary among individuals， thereby contributing to explain the huge interindividual variability in susceptibility to drugs and other environmental factors.
Bayesian Network to Infer Drug-Induced Apoptosis Circuits from Connectivity Map Data.,Methods Mol Biol, 2018,29767372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29767372/,"The Connectivity Map (CMAP) project profiled human cancer cell lines exposed to a library of anticancer compounds with the goal of connecting cancer with underlying genes and potential treatments. As most targeted anticancer therapeutics aim to induce tumor-selective apoptosis， it is critical to understand the specific cell death pathways triggered by drugs. This can help to better understand the mechanism of how cancer cells respond to chemical stimulations and improve the treatment of human tumors. In this study， using Connectivity MAP microarray-based gene expression data， we applied a Bayesian network modeling approach and identified apoptosis as a major drug-induced cellular pathway. We focused on 13 apoptotic genes that showed significant differential expression across all drug-perturbed samples to reconstruct the apoptosis network. In our predicted subnetwork， 9 out of 15 high-confidence interactions were validated in literature， and our inferred network captured two major cell death pathways by identifying BCL2L11 and PMAIP1 as key interacting players for the intrinsic apoptosis pathway， and TAXBP1 and TNFAIP3 for the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Our inferred apoptosis network also suggested the role of BCL2L11 and TNFAIP3 as ""gateway"" genes in the drug-induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways.Keywords:Apoptosis; Bayesian network; CMAP; Cancer; Drug discovery; Gene expression; Microarray."
Systematic Quality Control Analysis of LINCS Data.,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol, 2016 Nov,27796074,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27796074/,The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project provides comprehensive transcriptome profiling of human cell lines before and after chemical and genetic perturbations. Its L1000 platform utilizes 978 landmark genes to infer the transcript levels of 14，292 genes computationally. Here we conducted the L1000 data quality control analysis by using MCF7， PC3， and A375 cell lines as representative examples. Before perturbations， a promising 80% correlation in transcriptome was observed between L1000- and Affymetrix HU133A-platforms. After library-based shRNA perturbations， a moderate 30% of differentially expressed genes overlapped between any two selected controls viral vectors using the L1000 platform. The mitogen-activated protein kinase， vascular endothelial growth factor， and T-cell receptor pathways were identified as the most significantly shared pathways between chemical and genetic perturbations in cancer cells. In conclusion， L1000 platform is reliable in assessing transcriptome before perturbation. Its response to perturbagens needs to be interpreted with caution. A quality control analysis pipeline of L1000 is recommended before addressing biological questions.
Exosomal-microRNA transcriptome profiling of Parental and CSC-like MDA-MB-231 cells in response to cisplatin treatment.,Pathol Res Pract, 2022 May,35398617,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35398617/,Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with higher risk of metastasis and cancer reoccurrence. Cisplatin is one of the potential anticancer drugs for treating TNBC， where its effectiveness remains challenged by frequent occurrence of cisplatin resistance. Since acquirement of drug resistance often being associated with presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs)， investigation has been conducted， suggesting CSC-like subpopulation to be more resistant to cisplatin than their parental counterpart. On the other hand， plethora evidences showed the transmission of exosomal-miRNAs are capable of promoting drug resistance in breast cancers. In this study， we aim to elucidate the differential expression of exosomal-microRNAs profile and reveal the potential target genes in correlation to cisplatin resistance associated with CSC-like subpopulation by using TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231). Utilizing next generation sequencing and Nanostring techniques， cisplatin-induced dysregulation of exosomal-miRNAs were evaluated in maximal for CSC-like subpopulation as compared to parental cells. Intriguingly， more oncogenic exosomal-miRNAs profile was detected from treated CSC-like subpopulation， which may correlate to enhancement of drug resistance and maintenance of CSCs. In treated CSC-like subpopulation， unique clusters of exosomal-miRNAs namely miR-221-3p， miR-196a-5p， miR-17-5p and miR-126-3p were predicted to target on six genes (ATXN1， LATS1， GSK3β， ITGA6， JAG1 and MYC)， aligned with previous finding which demonstrated dysregulation of these genes in treated CSC-like subpopulation. Our results highlight the potential correlation of exosomal-miRNAs and their target genes as well as novel perspectives of the corresponding pathways that may be essential to contribute to the attenuated cytotoxicity of cisplatin in CSC-like subpopulation.Keywords:Cancer stem cells; Cisplatin resistance; Exosomal-miRNAs; Triple negative breast cancer.
Identification of drug combinations on the basis of machine learning to maximize anti-aging effects.,PLoS One, 2021 Jan 28,33507975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33507975/,ging is a multifactorial process that involves numerous genetic changes， so identifying anti-aging agents is quite challenging. Age-associated genetic factors must be better understood to search appropriately for anti-aging agents. We utilized an aging-related gene expression pattern-trained machine learning system that can implement reversible changes in aging by linking combinatory drugs. In silico gene expression pattern-based drug repositioning strategies， such as connectivity map， have been developed as a method for unique drug discovery. However， these strategies have limitations such as lists that differ for input and drug-inducing genes or constraints to compare experimental cell lines to target diseases. To address this issue and improve the prediction success rate， we modified the original version of expression profiles with a stepwise-filtered method. We utilized a machine learning system called deep-neural network (DNN). Here we report that combinational drug pairs using differential expressed genes (DEG) had a more enhanced anti-aging effect compared with single independent treatments on leukemia cells. This study shows potential drug combinations to retard the effects of aging with higher efficacy using innovative machine learning techniques.
Differential transcription profiling of the phage LUZ19 infection process in different growth media.,RNA Biol, 2021 Nov,33448239,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33448239/,RNA sequencing of phage-infected bacterial cultures offers a snapshot of transcriptional events occurring during the infection process， providing insights into the phage transcriptional organization as well as the bacterial response. To better mimic real environmental contexts， we performed RNA-seq ofPseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1 cultures infected with phage LUZ19 in a mammalian cell culture medium to better simulate a phage therapy event and the data were compared to lysogeny broth medium. Regardless of the media， phage LUZ19 induces significant transcriptional changes in the bacterial host over time， particularly during early infection (t= 5 min) and gradually shuts down bacterial transcription. In a common response in both media， 56P. aeruginosaPAO1 genes are differentially transcribed and clustered into several functional categories such as metabolism， translation and transcription. Our data allowed us to tease apart a medium-specific response during infection from the identified infection-associated responses. This reinforces the concept that phages overtake bacterial transcriptome in a strict manner to gain control of the bacterial machinery and reallocate resources for infection， in this case overcoming the nutritional limitations of the mammalian cell culture medium. From a phage therapy perspective， this study contributes towards a better understanding of phage-host interaction in human physiological conditions and demonstrates the versatility of phage LUZ19 to adapt to different environments.Keywords:Bacteriophage; P. aeruginosa; RNA-seq; gene expression; transcriptome.
MicroRNA profiling in human breast cancer cell lines exposed to the anti-neoplastic drug cediranib.,Oncol Rep, 2016 Dec,27748845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27748845/,Cediranib， a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor is showing promising results for the treatment of several solid tumours. In breast cancer， its effects remain unclear， and there are no predictive biomarkers. Several studies have examined the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in response to different chemotherapy treatments and found that the expression patterns may be associated with the treatment response. Therefore， our aim was to evaluate the cellular behaviour and differential expression profiles of miRNAs in breast cancer cell lines exposed to cediranib. The biological effect of this drug was measured by viability， migration， invasion and cell death in in vitro assays. Signaling pathways were assessed using a human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array. Furthermore， using a miRNA array and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT‑PCR)， we assessed the relative expression of miRNAs following cediranib treatment. The breast cancer cell lines exhibited a distinct cytotoxic response to cediranib treatment. Cediranib exposure resulted in a decrease in the cell migration and invasion of all the breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with cediranib appeared to be able to modulate the activation of several RTKs that are targets of cediranib such as EGFR and a new potential target ROR2. Furthermore， this drug was able to modulate the expression profile of different microRNAs such as miR-494， miR-923， miR-449a， miR-449b and miR-886-3 in breast cancer cell lines. These miRNAs are reported to regulate genes involved in important molecular processes， according to bioinformatics prediction tools.
Stem cell-like gene expression signature identified in ionizing radiation-treated cancer cells.,Gene, 2015 Nov 10,26255092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26255092/,Recent studies have reported that embryonic stem (ES) cell-associated gene expression signatures have been identified in poorly differentiated tumors， revealing a link between ES cell identity and cancer cells. Cancer cells originate from cancer stem cells (CSCs). Both types of cells share common properties such as self-renewal and heterogeneity. CSCs are also resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Here， we show similar gene expression patterns between ES cells and ionizing radiation (IR)-treated cancer cells. Using genome-wide transcriptome analysis， we compared the gene expression profiles among ES cells， cancer cells， and irradiated cancer cells， and identified a subset of similar gene expression patterns between ES cells and irradiated cancer cells， indicated by hierarchical clustering. These gene expression patterns were then confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses. Using bioinformatic analyses， these candidate genes are also associated with various biological pathways related to stemness in cancer. Taken together， our data suggest that identification of common molecular characteristics between ES cells and irradiated cancer cells is important to understand the properties of cancer stem cells and their resistance to radiotherapy.Keywords:Cancer stem cells; Embryonic stem (ES) cell; Expression microarray; Ionizing radiation.

A pan-cancer analysis of progression mechanisms and drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines.,Mol Omics, 2019 Dec 2,31570905,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570905/,Biomarker discovery involves identifying genetic abnormalities within a tumor. However， one of the main challenges in defining such therapeutic targets is accounting for the molecular heterogeneity of cancer. By integrating somatic mutation and gene expression data from hundreds of heterogeneous cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)， we identify sequences of genetic events that may help explain common patterns of oncogenesis across 22 tumor types， and evaluate the general effect of late-stage mutations on drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms. Through gene enrichment analysis， we find several cancer-specific and immune pathways that are significantly enriched in each of our three proposed phases of cancer progression. By further analyzing the drug activity area associated with compounds that target the BRAF oncogene， a known predictor of drug sensitivity for several compounds used in cancer treatment， we verify that the acquisition of new driver mutations interferes with the targeted drug mechanism， meaning that cells without late-stage mutations generally respond better to drugs.
Transcription profiling of gene expression in drug discovery and development: the NCI experience.,Eur J Cancer, 2004 Nov,15541957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15541957/,Transcript profiling， using microarray or other analogous technologies， to query on a large-scale the expression of genes in tumours or their derivative cell lines has numerous potential uses in oncology drug discovery and development. Characterisation of genes expressed in tumours may allow tumours to be separated into subsets defining subtypes that have a distinctive pathway utilisation. The molecular entities comprising the pathways which distinguish one disease subset from another then become potential candidate drug targets. Alternatively， gene expression patterns may be correlated with the degree of antiproliferative effect of candidate drug leads. This can reveal aspects of the drug's action that could serve to provide a further basis for benchmarking the generation of analogues or provide important information about pathways potentially modulated by the drug in achieving cytotoxicity. New information is emerging that the expression of drug transport-related molecules is a major variable that can be usefully explored using gene expression data， and the features promoting successful drug handling by the tumour cell may be an additional variable which can be illuminated by gene expression studies.
Transcriptomic evidence of black soybean ethanolic extract and 2-aminobutyric acid in suppressing neuroinflammation and enhancing synaptic transmission.,Biomed Pharmacother, 2024 Dec,39488055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39488055/,Introduction:Recently， the awareness of the beneficial utilization of natural bioactive compounds in treating neuroinflammation has gained particular attention. We aimed to understand the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of black soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr) ethanolic extract (BBEE) and its bioactive compound， 2-aminobutyric acid (2-AB)， against LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells.Method:Cell viability and the optimum therapeutic dose were confirmed by MTT assay. We conducted a whole-transcriptomic analysis of BBEE and 2-AB in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells using microarray normalized with SST-RMA. DEGs were selected based on p-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2， and validated by RT-qPCR and immunocytochemical analyses.Results:We found that both BBEE and 2-AB down-regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFA under LPS-induced conditions. This was also observed in the microarray data， showing downregulation of several inflammatory pathways， such as NF-kB， and IL6-JAK/STAT3-signaling pathways. In contrast， it upregulated the expression of CALML3， GRIN2， and GRIA2 gene expressions， which influence the AMPK and CAMK2 signaling pathways， indicating the potential of BBEE in neurotransmission and synaptic function. Also， immunofluorescence analysis revealed that 2-AB treatment significantly increased PSD-95 and Ca2+levels， suggesting its effect on synaptic transmission essential for brain function.Conclusion:Our findings suggest the potential anti-neuroinflammatory effects of BBEE and 2-AB， which may offer therapeutic and preventive benefits in mitigating neurological disorders. Given that BB is widely consumed in many Asian countries， our study may encourage its incorporation into the daily diet to slow inflammation-induced neurodegenerative disorders， reduce age-related cognitive decline， and enhance overall brain function.Keywords:Black soybean; Neuroinflammation; Proinflammatory cytokine; Synaptic transmission; Transcriptomics.
Toxicogenomics of A375 human malignant melanoma cells.,Pharmacogenomics, 2007 Aug,17716235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17716235/,Toxicogenomics applications are increasingly applied to the evaluation of preclinical drug safety， and to explain toxicities associated with compounds at the mechanism level. In this review， we aim to describe the application of toxicogenomics tools for studying the genotoxic effect of active compounds on the gene-expression profile of A375 human malignant melanoma cells， through the other molecular functions of target genes， regulatory pathways and mechanisms of malignant melanomas. It also includes the current systems biology approaches， which are very useful for analyzing the biological system and understanding the entire mechanisms of malignant melanomas. We believe that this review would be very potent and useful for studying the toxicogenomics of A375 melanoma cells， and for further diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
Analysis of Transcriptome， Selected Intracellular Signaling Pathways， Proliferation and Apoptosis of LNCaP Cells Exposed to High Leptin Concentrations.,Int J Mol Sci, 2019 Oct 30,31671654,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31671654/,Leptin， the first discovered adipokine， has been connected to various physiological and pathophysiological processes， including cancerogenesis. Increasing evidence confirms its influence on prostate cancer cells. However， studies on the effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of the androgen-sensitive LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells brought conflicting results. Therefore， we performed studies on the effects of high LEP concentration (1 × 10-6M) on gene expression profile， change of selected signaling pathways， proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells. RTCA (real-time cell analyzer) revealed inhibitory effect of LEP on cell proliferation， but lower LEP concentrations (10-8and 10-10M) did not affect cell division. Moreover， flow cytometry with a specific antibody for Cleaved PARP-1， an apoptosis marker， confirmed the activation of apoptosis in leptin-exposed LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells. Within 24 h LEP (10-6M) increases expression of 297 genes and decreases expression of 119 genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to functional annotation and clusterization using the DAVID bioinformatics tools. Most ontological groups are associated with proliferation and apoptosis (seven groups)， immune response (six) and extracellular matrix (two). These results were confirmed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The leptin's effect on apoptosis stimulation was also confirmed using Pathview library. These results were also confirmed by qPCR method. The results of Western Blot analysis (exposure to LEP 10 min， 1， 2， 4 and 24 h) suggest (after 24 h) decrease of p38 MAPK， p44-42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Bcl-2 phosphorylated at threonine 56. Moreover， exposure of LNCaP cells to LEP significantly stimulates the secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7). Obtained results suggest activation of apoptotic processes in LNCaP cells cultured at high LEP concentration. At the same time， this activation is accompanied by inhibition of proliferation of the tested cells.Keywords:LNCaP; apoptosis; intracellular signaling pathways; leptin; proliferation; prostate cancer cells; transcriptome analysis.
Transcriptome-based drug repositioning identifies TPCA-1 as a potential selective inhibitor of esophagus squamous carcinoma cell viability.,Int J Mol Med, 2022 Jun,35417037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35417037/,Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a cancer type with limited treatment options. The present study aimed to screen for small molecules that may inhibit ESCC cell viability. The small‑molecule‑perturbed signatures were extrapolated from the library of integrated network‑based cellular signatures (LINCS) database. Since LINCS does not include small‑molecule‑perturbed signatures of ESCC cells， it was hypothesized that non‑ESCC cell lines that display transcriptome profiles similar to those of ESCC may have similar small‑molecule‑perturbated responses to ESCC cells and that identifying small molecules that inhibit the viability of these non‑ESCC cells may also inhibit the viability of ESCC cells. The transcriptomes of >1，000 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database were analyzed and 70 non‑ESCC cell lines exhibiting similar transcriptome profiles to those of ESCC cells were identified. Among them， six cell lines with transcriptome signatures upon drug perturbation were available in the LINCS， which were used as reference signatures. A total of 20 ESCC datasets were analyzed and 522 downregulated and 461 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were consistently altered across >50% of the datasets were identified. These DEGs together with the reference signatures were then used as inputs of the ZhangScore method to score small molecules that may reverse transcriptome alterations of ESCC. Among the top‑ranked 50 molecules identified by the ZhangScore， four candidates that may inhibit ESCC cell viability were experimentally verified. Furthermore， 2‑[(aminocarbonyl)amino]‑5‑(4‑fluorophenyl)‑3‑-thiophenecarboxamide (TPCA‑1)， an inhibitor of the NF‑κB pathway， was able to preferentially inhibit the viability of ESCC cells compared with non‑tumorigenic epithelial Het‑1A cells. Mechanistically， TPCA‑1 induced ESCC KYSE‑450 cell apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF‑κB kinase subunit β， leading to IκBα stabilization and NF‑κB signaling pathway inhibition. Collectively， these results demonstrated that LINCS‑based drug repositioning may facilitate drug discovery and that TPCA‑1 may be a promising candidate molecule in the treatment of ESCC.Keywords:ZhangScore; drug discovery; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; gene expression profiling; library of integrated network‑based cellular signatures.
Microarray-based detection and expression analysis of extracellular matrix proteins in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines.,Oncol Rep, 2014 Nov,25199881,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25199881/,Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) development leads to resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Microarray methods can provide information regarding new candidate genes that can play a role in resistance to cytostatic drugs. Extracellular matrix (ECM) can influence drug resistance by inhibiting the penetration of the drug into cancer tissue as well as increased apoptosis resistance. In the present study， we report changes in the ECM and related gene expression pattern in methotrexate-， cisplatin-， doxorubicin-， vincristine-， topotecan- and paclitaxel-resistant variants of the W1 ovarian cancer cell line. The resistant variants of the W1 cell line were generated by stepwise selection of cells with an increasing concentration of the indicated drugs. Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Genome U219 Array Strips were used for hybridizations. Independent t-tests were used to determinate the statistical significance of results. Genes whose expression levels were higher than the assumed threshold (upregulated， >5-fold and downregulated， <5-fold) were visualized using the scatter plot method， selected and listed in the tables. Among the investigated genes， expression of 24 genes increased， expression of 14 genes decreased and expression of three genes increased or decreased depending on the cell line. Among the increased genes， expression of 10 increased very significantly， >20-fold. These genes were: ITGB1BP3， COL3A1， COL5A2， COL15A1， TGFBI， DCN， LUM， MATN2， POSTN and EGFL6. The expression of seven genes decreased very significantly: ITGA1， COL1A2， LAMA2， GPC3， KRT23， VIT and HMCN1. The expression pattern of ECM and related genes provided the preliminary view into the role of ECM components in cytostatic drug resistance of cancer cells. The exact role of the investigated genes in drug resistance requires further investigation.
Effect of ex vivo culture conditions on immunosuppression by human mesenchymal stem cells.,Biomed Res Int, 2013,23862134,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23862134/, microarray analysis was performed to investigate whether ex vivo culture conditions affect the characteristics of MSCs. Gene expression profiles were mainly influenced by the level of cell confluence rather than initial seeding density. The analysis showed that 276 genes were upregulated and 230 genes downregulated in MSCs harvested at ~90% versus ~50% confluence (P < 0.05， FC > 2). The genes that were highly expressed in MSCs largely corresponded to chemotaxis， inflammation， and immune responses， indicating direct or indirect involvement in immunomodulatory functions. Specifically， PTGES and ULBP1 were up-regulated in MSCs harvested at high density. Treatment of MSCs with PTGES or ULBP1 siRNA reversed their inhibition of T-cell proliferation in vitro. The culture conditions such as cell confluence at harvest seem to be important for gene expression profile of MSCs; therefore， the results of this study may provide useful guidelines for the harvest of MSCs that can appropriately suppress the immune response.
A cmap-enabled gene expression signature-matching approach identifies small-molecule inducers of accelerated cell senescence.,BMC Genomics, 2019 Apr 15,30987592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987592/,Background:Diverse stresses including genotoxic therapy can induce proliferating cancer cells to undergo cellular senescence and take on the characteristic phenotypes of replicative cellular aging. This accelerated or therapy-induced senescence has been alternatively proposed to contribute to therapeutic efficacy or resistance. Toward better understanding this cell state， we sought to define the core transcriptome of accelerated senescence in cancer cells.Results:We examined senescence induced by ionizing irradiation or ectopic overexpression of the stoichiometric cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21CIP/WAF1/SDI1in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7. While radiation produces a strong DNA damage response， ectopic expression of p21 arrests cell cycle progression independently of DNA damage. Both conditions promoted senescence within 5 days. Microarray analysis revealed 378 up- and 391 down-regulated genes that were shared between the two conditions， representing a candidate signature. Systems analysis of the shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed strong signals for cell cycle control and DNA damage response pathways and predicted multiple upstream regulators previously linked to senescence. Querying the shared DEGs against the Connectivity Map (cmap) database of transcriptional responses to small molecules yielded 20 compounds that induce a similar gene expression pattern in MCF7 cells. Of 16 agents evaluated， six induced senescence on their own. Of these， the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant and the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor vorinostat did so without causing chromosomal damage.Conclusions:Using a systems biology approach with experimental validation， we have defined a core gene expression signature for therapy-induced senescence.Keywords:Connectivity map analysis; DNA damage foci; Differential expression genes; Radiation-induced senescence; Small molecule inhibitors; Transcriptome analysis; Upstream regulator factors; p21-induced senescence.
Overcoming chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer cells by liposomal cisplatin: molecular mechanisms unveiled by gene expression profiling.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2013 Apr 15,23396090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396090/,Previously we reported that liposomal cisplatin (CDDP) overcomes CDDP resistance of ovarian A2780cis cancer cells (Krieger et al.， Int. J. Pharm. 389， 2010， 10-17). Here we find that the cytotoxic activity of liposomal CDDP is not associated with detectable DNA platination in resistant ovarian cancer cells. This suggests that the mode of action of liposomal CDDP is different from the free drug. To gain insight into mechanisms of liposomal CDDP activity， we performed a transcriptome analysis of untreated A2780cis cells， and A2780cis cells in response to exposure with IC50 values of free or liposomal CDDP. A process network analysis of upregulated genes showed that liposomal CDDP induced a highly different gene expression profile in comparison to the free drug. p53 was identified as a key player directing transcriptional responses to free or liposomal CDDP. The free drug induced expression of essential genes of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway (BAX， BID， CASP9) most likely through p38MAPK activation. In contrast， liposomal CDDP induced expression of genes from DNA damage pathways and several genes of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (TNFRSF10B-DR5， CD70-TNFSF7). It thus appears that liposomal CDDP overcomes CDDP resistance by inducing DNA damage and in consequence programmed cell death by the extrinsic pathway. Predictions from gene expression data with respect to apoptosis activation were confirmed at the protein level by an apoptosis antibody array. This sheds new light on liposomal drug carrier approaches in cancer and suggests liposomal CDDP as promising strategy for the treatment of CDDP resistant ovarian carcinomas.
SREBP2 contributes to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.,Exp Biol Med (Maywood), 2018 Apr,29466876,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466876/,This study is to investigate transcription factors involved in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. The transcriptome of cisplatin resistant and sensitive A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells was obtained from GSE15372. Ovarian transcriptome data GSE62944 was downloaded from TCGA and applied for transcription regulatory network analysis. The analysis results were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The roles of SREBP2 in cisplatin-resistant cells were investigated by RNA inference and cell viability analysis. Transcription regulatory network analysis found that 12 transcription factors and their targets were involved in cisplatin resistant in A2780 cells. Among these factors， the targets of EZH2 and SREBP2 revealed by Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining were also enriched in differentially expressed genes between cisplatin resistant and cisplatin sensitive cells. Their targets were enriched mainly in cell cycle and cholesterol metabolic process， respectively. Bioinformatic analysis illustrated three known targets of SREBP2， namely LDLR， FDFT1， and HMGCR were increased in A2780-resistant cell lines. Additionally， the three genes and SREBP2 were also elevated in live cells after cisplatin treatment via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Importantly， RNA inference of SREBP2 in A2780 cell line resulted in a decrease of cell viability after cisplatin treatment. SREBP2 played important roles in cisplatin resistance and cholesterol metabolic process might be a novel target for cancer therapy. Impact statement Transcriptome of cisplatin resistant and sensitive A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells was obtained from GSE15372 and TCGA. Twelve transcription factors and their targets were involved in cisplatin resistant. Among these factors， the targets of EZH2 and SREBP2 revealed by Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining were also enriched in differentially expressed genes. Their targets were enriched mainly in cell cycle and cholesterol metabolic process. Three targets of SREBP2， namely LDLR， FDFT1， and HMGCR were increased in A2780-resistant cell lines and were found elevated in live cells after cisplatin treatment via qPCR. RNAi of SREBP2 in A2780 cell line resulted in a decrease of cell viability after cisplatin treatment. SREBP2 played important roles in cisplatin resistance and might be a novel target for cancer therapy.Keywords:Cisplatin resistance; cholesterol metabolic process; differentially expressed genes; sterol regulatory element binding protein 2; transcription factors; transcription regulatory inference.

Identification of potential chemical compounds enhancing generation of enucleated cells from immortalized human erythroid cell lines.,Commun Biol, 2021 Jun 3,34083702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34083702/,Immortalized erythroid cell lines are expected to be a promising source of ex vivo manufactured red blood cells (RBCs)， however the induction of enucleation in these cell lines is inefficient at present. We utilized an imaging-based high-throughput system to identify chemical compounds that trigger enucleation of human erythroid cell lines. Among >3，300 compounds， we identified multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) inducing enucleated cells from the cell line， although an increase in membrane fragility of enucleated cells was observed. Gene expression profiling revealed that HDACi treatment increased the expression of cytoskeletal genes， while an erythroid-specific cell membrane protein， SPTA1， was significantly down-regulated. Restoration of SPTA1 expression using CRISPR-activation partially rescued the fragility of cells and thereby improved the enucleation efficiency. Our observations provide a potential solution for the generation of mature cells from erythroid cell lines， contributing to the future realization of the use of immortalized cell lines for transfusion therapies.
Genomic profiling of long non-coding RNA and mRNA expression associated with acquired temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells.,Int J Oncol, 2017 Aug,28714520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28714520/,Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent widely used in anti-glioma treatment. However， acquired TMZ resistance represents a major clinical challenge that leads to tumor relapse or progress. This study investigated the genomic profiles including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression associated with acquired TMZ resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) cells in vitro. The TMZ-resistant (TR) of GBM sub-cell lines were established through repetitive exposure to increasing TMZ concentrations in vitro. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between the parental U87 and U87TR cells were detected by human lncRNA microarray method. In this study， we identified 2，692 distinct lncRNAs demonstrating >2-fold differential expression with 1，383 lncRNAs upregulated and 1，309 lncRNAs downregulated. Moreover， 4，886 differential mRNAs displayed 2，933 mRNAs upregulated and 1，953 mRNAs downregulated. Further lncRNA classification and subgroup analysis revealed the potential functions of the lncRNA-mRNA relationship associated with the acquired TMZ resistance. Gene ontology and pathway analysis on mRNAs showed significant biological regulatory genes and pathways involved in acquired TMZ resistance. Moreover， we found the ECM‑receptor interaction pathway was significantly downregulated and ECM related collagen Ι， fibronectin， laminin and CD44 were closely associated with the TR phenotype in vitro. Our findings indicate that the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs identified in this work may provide novel targets for overcoming acquired TMZ resistance in GBM chemotherapy.

Drug screening approach combines epigenetic sensitization with immunochemotherapy in cancer.,Clin Epigenetics, 2019 Dec 11,31829282,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31829282/,Background:The epigenome plays a key role in cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance. Hence， a number of epigenetic inhibitors have been developed and tested in cancers. The major focus of most studies so far has been on the cytotoxic effect of these compounds， and only few have investigated the ability to revert the resistant phenotype in cancer cells. Hence， there is a need for a systematic methodology to unravel the mechanisms behind epigenetic sensitization.Results:We have developed a high-throughput protocol to screen non-simultaneous drug combinations， and used it to investigate the reprogramming potential of epigenetic inhibitors. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our protocol by screening 60 epigenetic compounds on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells. We identified several histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors that acted synergistically with doxorubicin and rituximab. These two classes of epigenetic inhibitors achieved sensitization by disrupting DNA repair， cell cycle， and apoptotic signaling. The data used to perform these analyses are easily browsable through our Results Explorer. Additionally， we showed that these inhibitors achieve sensitization at lower doses than those required to induce cytotoxicity.Conclusions:Our drug screening approach provides a systematic framework to test non-simultaneous drug combinations. This methodology identified HDAC and HMT inhibitors as successful sensitizing compounds in treatment-resistant DLBCL. Further investigation into the mechanisms behind successful epigenetic sensitization highlighted DNA repair， cell cycle， and apoptosis as the most dysregulated pathways. Altogether， our method adds supporting evidence in the use of epigenetic inhibitors as sensitizing agents in clinical settings.Keywords:DLBCL; Drug resistance in cancer; Epigenetic reprogramming; High-throughput drug screening; epigenetic inhibitors.
Whole-Transcriptome Analysis of CD133+CD144+ Cancer Stem Cells Derived from Human Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.,Cell Physiol Biochem, 2018,29949786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29949786/,Background/aims:CD133+CD44+ cancer stem cells previously isolated from laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cell lines showed strong malignancy and tumorigenicity. However， the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced malignancy remained unclear.Methods:Cell proliferation assay， spheroid-formation experiment， RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)， miRNA-seq， bioinformatic analysis， quantitative real-time PCR， migration assay， invasion assay， and luciferase reporter assay were used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs， lncRNAs， circRNAs and miRNAs， construct transcription regulatory network， and investigate functional roles and mechanism of circRNA in CD133+CD44+ laryngeal cancer stem cells.Results:Differentially expressed genes in TDP cells were mainly enriched in the biological processes of cell differentiation， regulation of autophagy， negative regulation of cell death， regulation of cell growth， response to hypoxia， telomere maintenance， cellular response to gamma radiation， and regulation of apoptotic signaling， which are closely related to the malignant features of tumor cells. We constructed the regulatory network of differentially expressed circRNAs， miRNAs and mRNAs. qPCR findings for the expression of key genes in the network were consistent with the sequencing data. Moreover， our data revealed that circRNA hg19_circ_0005033 promotes proliferation， migration， invasion， and chemotherapy resistance of laryngeal cancer stem cells.Conclusions:This study provides potential biomarkers and targets for LSCC diagnosis and therapy， and provide important evidences for the heterogeneity of LSCC cells at the transcription level.Keywords:CD133+CD44+; Cancer stem cells; Circular RNA; Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma; Whole transcriptome analysis.

Tumour microenvironment-based molecular profiling reveals ideal candidates for high-grade serous ovarian cancer immunotherapy.,Cell Prolif, 2021 Mar,33522069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33522069/,Objective:Due to limited immunological profiles of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)， we aimed to characterize its molecular features to determine whether a specific subset that can respond to immunotherapy exists.Materials and methods:A training cohort of 418 HGSOC samples from TCGA was analysed by consensus non-negative matrix factorization. We correlated the expression patterns with the presence of immune cell infiltrates， immune regulatory molecules and other genomic or epigenetic features. Two independent cohorts containing 482 HGSOCs and in vitro experiments were used for validation.Results:We identified immune and non-immune groups where the former was enriched in signatures that reflect immune cells， infiltration and PD-1 signalling (all， P < 0.001)， and presented with a lower chromosomal aberrations but increased neoantigens， tumour mutation burden， and microsatellite instability (all， P < 0.05); this group was further refined into two microenvironment-based subtypes characterized by either immunoactivation or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and distinct prognosis. CAFs-immune subtype was enriched for factors that mediate immunosuppression and promote tumour progression， including highly expressed stromal signature， TGF-β signalling， epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumour-associated M2-polarized macrophages (all， P < 0.001). Robustness of these immune-specific subtypes was verified in validation cohorts， and in vitro experiments indicated that activated-immune subtype may benefit from anti-PD1 antibody therapy (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Our findings revealed two immune subtypes with different responses to immunotherapy and indicated that some HGSOCs may be susceptible to immunotherapies or combination therapies.Keywords:high-grade serous ovarian cancer; immune-specific subtype; immunotherapy response; molecular classification; tumour immune microenvironment.

Palmitate-induced ER stress increases trastuzumab sensitivity in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells.,BMC Cancer, 2016 Jul 27,27464732,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464732/,Background:HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells have recently been shown to use a unique Warburg-like metabolism for survival and aggressive behavior. These cells exhibit increased fatty acid synthesis and storage compared to normal breast cells or other tumor cells. Disruption of this synthetic process results in apoptosis. Since the addition of physiological doses of exogenous palmitate induces cell death in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells， the pathway is likely operating at its limits in these cells. We have studied the response of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells to physiological concentrations of exogenous palmitate to identify lipotoxicity-associated consequences of this physiology. Since epidemiological data show that a diet rich in saturated fatty acids is negatively associated with the development of HER2/neu-positive cancer， this cellular physiology may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of the disease. We sought to identify signaling pathways that are regulated by physiological concentrations of exogenous palmitate specifically in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells and gain insights into the molecular mechanism and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment.Methods:Transcriptional profiling was performed to assess programs that are regulated in HER2-normal MCF7 and HER2/neu-positive SKBR3 breast cancer cells in response to exogenous palmitate. Computational analyses were used to define and predict functional relationships and identify networks that are differentially regulated in the two cell lines. These predictions were tested using reporter assays， fluorescence-based high content microscopy， flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Physiological effects were confirmed in HER2/neu-positive BT474 and HCC1569 breast cancer cell lines.Results:Exogenous palmitate induces functionally distinct transcriptional programs in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells. In the lipogenic HER2/neu-positive SKBR3 cell line， palmitate induces a G2 phase cell cycle delay and CHOP-dependent apoptosis as well as a partial activation of the ER stress response network via XBP1 and ATF6. This response appears to be a general feature of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells but not cells that overexpress only HER2/neu. Exogenous palmitate reduces HER2 and HER3 protein levels without changes in phosphorylation and sensitizes HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells to treatment with the HER2-targeted therapy trastuzumab.Conclusions:Several studies have shown that HER2， FASN and fatty acid synthesis are functionally linked. Exogenous palmitate exerts its toxic effects in part through inducing ER stress， reducing HER2 expression and thereby sensitizing cells to trastuzumab. These data provide further evidence that HER2 signaling and fatty acid metabolism are highly integrated processes that may be important for disease development and progression.Keywords:ER stress; ERBB2; HER2/neu; High fat diet; Metabolism; Palmitate; Saturated fat; Trastuzumab.

Gene Expression Profiling of Maslinic Acid-treated MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells Using Nanostring nCounter Pancancer Pathway Panel.,Gene, 2025 Jan 30,39486662,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39486662/,Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern， impacting millions of women every year. Maslinic acid (MA)， a pentacyclic triterpene has been found to exert promising anticancer effect in various cancers， including breast cancer， yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the anticancer properties of MA via gene expression profiles in breast cancer cells. Cytotoxicity assay results revealed that MCF-7 exerts the highest sensitivity after 72 h of MA treatment followed by T-47D and MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 were then selected for in-depth analysis using the Nanostring nCounter Pancancer Pathway Panel to analyze the differential expression of genes (DEGs). Across three time points (24， 48， and 72 h)， 20 significant DEGs were identified， of which 5 were upregulated and 15 were downregulated. In silico analysis indicated that these DEGs were involved in Pathway of Cancer， Focal Adhesion-PI3K-mTOR Signaling Pathway， PI3K-Akt， and Ras Signaling Pathway. The regulation of these DEGs contributes to several cellular activities such as apoptosis， inhibition of cell proliferation， cell cycle and survival， reduction of glycolysis， angiogenesis， and DNA repair. Additionally， the unfolded protein response emerged as a noteworthy biological process in this study. This study unravels the molecular mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic potential of MA against breast cancer.Keywords:Anticancer; Breast cancer; Hallmarks of cancer; Maslinic acid.
Current therapy and the evolving molecular landscape of paediatric ependymoma.,Eur J Cancer, 2017 Jan,27866097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27866097/,Ependymomas are the third commonest paediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumour， accounting for 6-12% of brain tumours in children. The management of these tumours has seen considerable changes over the last two decades， leading to a significant improvement in outcomes. However， despite advances in neurosurgical， neuroimaging and postoperative adjuvant therapy， management of these tumours remain challenging， and recurrence occurs in over 50% of cases， particularly when complete resection is not achieved prior to conformal radiotherapy. To-date no chemotherapeutic regimen has proven to be of significant clinical benefit. Predicting tumour behaviour and defining robust correlates of disease outcome based on histopathology and clinical characteristics remains suboptimal. Paucity of cell lines， failure to develop ideal animal models of these tumours， have precluded better understanding of the oncogenic drivers， undermining development of targeted therapies. Over the last few years breakthrough in the understanding of the molecular biology， are now providing clues to therapeutic insights. It is clear that even with histopathological similarities， these are genetically heterogeneous tumours with diverse clinical outcomes. Rapid evolution of data based on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns， have now identified nine molecular subgroups in these tumours， across three anatomic compartments which include supratentorial (ST)， posterior fossa (PF) and the spinal locations. More recently based on transcriptome profiling， two subgroups (group A and B) of PF ependymoma have been identified with distinct molecular， clinical characteristics and specific chromosomal aberrations. This review includes current management， evolving molecular biology and the shifting paradigm of treatment profile that targets molecular alterations in paediatric ependymoma.Keywords:Current therapy; Molecular biology; Paediatric ependymoma; Therapeutic insights.

GDA， a web-based tool for Genomics and Drugs integrated analysis.,Nucleic Acids Res, 2018 Jul 2,29800349,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800349/,Several major screenings of genetic profiling and drug testing in cancer cell lines proved that the integration of genomic portraits and compound activities is effective in discovering new genetic markers of drug sensitivity and clinically relevant anticancer compounds. Despite most genetic and drug response data are publicly available， the availability of user-friendly tools for their integrative analysis remains limited， thus hampering an effective exploitation of this information. Here， we present GDA， a web-based tool for Genomics and Drugs integrated Analysis that combines drug response data for >50 800 compounds with mutations and gene expression profiles across 73 cancer cell lines. Genomic and pharmacological data are integrated through a modular architecture that allows users to identify compounds active towards cancer cell lines bearing a specific genomic background and， conversely， the mutational or transcriptional status of cells responding or not-responding to a specific compound. Results are presented through intuitive graphical representations and supplemented with information obtained from public repositories. As both personalized targeted therapies and drug-repurposing are gaining increasing attention， GDA represents a resource to formulate hypotheses on the interplay between genomic traits and drug response in cancer.

Characterization of liver zonation-like transcriptomic patterns in HLCs derived from hiPSCs in a microfluidic biochip environment.,Biotechnol Prog, 2020 Sep,32364651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32364651/,The liver zonation is an important phenomenon characterized by a gradient of several functions along the liver acinus. However， this gradient remains difficult to reproduce in in-vitro conditions， making the obtention of an in-vitro method to recapitulate the liver zonation a challenging issue. In this study， we evaluated the spatial evolution of the transcriptome profile of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiated toward hepatocytes-like cells (HLCs) phenotype in a microfluidic biochip environment. Cells collected at the inlet of the biochip， where the oxygen concentration is higher， were identified by the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways related to cellular reorganization and cell proliferation. Cells collected in the middle and at the outlet of the biochips， where oxygen concentrations are lower， were characterized by the upregulation of genes involved in cellular detoxification processes (CYP450)， PPAR signaling or arginine biosynthesis. A subset of 16 transcription factors (TFs) was extracted and identified as upstream regulators to HNF1A and PPARA. These TFs are also known as regulators to target genes engaged in the Wnt/βcatenin pathway， in the TGFβ/BMP/SMAD signaling， in the transition between epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET)， in the homeostasis of lipids， bile acids and carbohydrates homeostasis， in drug metabolism， in the estrogen processing and in the oxidative stress response. Overall， the analysis allowed to confirm a partial zonation-like pattern in hiPSCs-derived HLCs in the microfluidic biochip environment. These results provide important insights into the reproduction of liver zonation in-vitro for a better understanding of the phenomenon.Keywords:HLCs; hepatocytes; hiPSCs; liver zonation; microfluidic biochips; nanoCAGE.
Agonists and knockdown of estrogen receptor beta differentially affect invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro.,BMC Cancer, 2016 Dec 21,28003019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28003019/,Background:Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is expressed in the majority of invasive breast cancer cases， irrespective of their subtype， including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus， ERβ might be a potential target for therapy of this challenging cancer type. In this in vitro study， we examined the role of ERβ in invasion of two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines.Methods:MDA-MB-231 and HS578T breast cancer cells were treated with the specific ERβ agonists ERB-041， WAY200070， Liquiritigenin and 3β-Adiol. Knockdown of ERβ expression was performed by means of siRNA transfection. Effects on cellular invasion were assessed in vitro by means of a modified Boyden chamber assay. Transcriptome analyses were performed using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. Pathway and gene network analyses were performed by means of Genomatix and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.Results:Invasiveness of MBA-MB-231 and HS578T breast cancer cells decreased after treatment with ERβ agonists ERB-041 and WAY200070. Agonists Liquiritigenin and 3β-Adiol only reduced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of ERβ expression increased invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells about 3-fold. Transcriptome and pathway analyses revealed that ERβ knockdown led to activation of TGFβ signalling and induced expression of a network of genes with functions in extracellular matrix， tumor cell invasion and vitamin D3 metabolism.Conclusions:Our data suggest that ERβ suppresses invasiveness of triple-negative breast cancer cells in vitro. Whether ERβ agonists might be useful drugs in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer， has to be evaluated in further animal and clinical studies.Keywords:Cell culture; Estrogen receptor beta; Invasion; Triple-negative breast cancer.
Clinical and Genomic Implications of Luminal and Basal Subtypes Across Carcinomas.,Clin Cancer Res, 2019 Apr 15,30573691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30573691/,Purpose:Carcinomas originate from epithelial tissues， which have apical (luminal) and basal orientations. The degree of luminal versus basal differentiation in cancer has been shown to be biologically important in some carcinomas and impacts treatment response.Experimental design:Although prior studies have focused on individual cancer types， we used a modified clinical-grade classifier (PAM50) to subtype 8，764 tumors across 22 different carcinomas into luminal A， luminal B， and basal-like tumors.Results:We found that all epithelial tumors demonstrated similar gene expression-based luminal/basal subtypes. As expected， basal-like tumors were associated with increased expression of the basal markers KRT5/6 and KRT14， and luminal-like tumors were associated with increased expression of the luminal markers KRT20. Luminal A tumors consistently had improved outcomes compared with basal across many tumor types， with luminal B tumors falling between the two. Basal tumors had the highest rates of TP53 and RB1 mutations and copy number loss. Luminal breast， cervical， ovarian， and endometrial tumors had increased ESR1 expression， and luminal prostate， breast， cervical， and bladder tumors had increased androgen receptor (AR) expression. Furthermore， luminal B tumors had the highest rates of AR and ESR1 mutations and had increased sensitivityin vitroto bicalutamide and tamoxifen. Luminal B tumors were more sensitive to gemcitabine， and basal tumors were more sensitive to docetaxel.Conclusions:This first pan-carcinoma luminal/basal subtyping across epithelial tumors reveals global similarities across carcinomas in the transcriptome， genome， clinical outcomes， and drug sensitivity， emphasizing the biological and translational importance of these luminal versus basal subtypes.
A dynamic transcriptomic atlas of cytokine-induced killer cells.,J Biol Chem, 2018 Dec 21,30333226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333226/,Several clinical immunotherapy trials with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have been reported. However， molecular evidence of cell expansion， acquisition of tumor cytotoxicity， and safety of CIK cells is required before putting them to clinical use. Here， we performed dynamic transcriptomic analyses of CIKs generated from primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to interferon-γ， OKT3， and interleukin-2. CIK mRNAs were extracted and sequenced at days 0， 1， 7， and 14 and subjected to bioinformatics analyses. Using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA)， we identified two major gene modules that mediate immune cell activation and mitosis. We found that activation and cytotoxicity of CIK cells likely rely on cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and its protein partner LCK proto-oncogene， Src family tyrosine kinase (LCK). A time-course series analysis revealed that CIK cells have relatively low immunogenicity because of decreased expression of some self-antigens. Importantly， we identified several crucial activating receptors and auxiliary adhesion receptors expressed on CIK cells that may function as tumor sensors. Interestingly， cytotoxicity-associated genes， including those encoding PRF1， GZMB， FASL， and several cytokines， were up-regulated in mature CIK cells. Most immune-checkpoint molecules and inflammatory tumor-promoting factors were down-regulated in the CIK cells， suggesting efficacy and safety in future clinical trials. Notably， insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was highly expressed in CIK cells and may promote cytotoxicity， although it also could facilitate tumorigenesis. The transcriptomic atlas of CIK cells presented here may inform efforts to improve CIK-associated tumor cytotoxicity and safety in clinical trials.Keywords:CD8; WGCNA; anticancer treatment; bioinformatics; computational biology; cytokine; cytokine-induced killer cells; cytotoxicity; deep sequencing; immunology; immunotherapy; safety; tumor therapy.
Comprehensive analysis of alterations in the miRNome in response to photodynamic treatment.,J Photochem Photobiol B, 2013 Mar 5,23466801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23466801/,Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a local tumour treatment accepted for a number of indications. PDT operates via the cellular stress response through the production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent cellular damage， resulting in cell death. Although PDT-induced signalling and cytotoxicity mechanisms have been investigated， the effect of PDT on microRNA (miRNA) expression is largely unknown. Therefore， we conducted a comprehensive microarray-based analysis of the miRNome of human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) following in vitro photodynamic treatment using polyvinylpyrrolidone hypericin (PVPH) as a photosensitiser and nearly homogeneous apoptosis-inducing conditions. Using microarray analysis we found eight miRNAs to be significantly differentially expressed 5h post treatment compared with the baseline levels and three miRNAs with more than 2-fold differential expression that could be detected in 1 or 2 biological replicates. The verification of these results by quantitative RT-PCR including a detailed time-course revealed an up to 15-fold transient over-expression of miR-634， miR-1246， miR-1290 and miR-487b compared with the basal level. For these miRNAs， in silico mRNA target prediction yielded numerous target transcripts involved in the regulation of cell stress， apoptosis， cell adherence and proliferation. This study provides the first comprehensive miRNome analysis after PDT treatment and may help to develop novel miRNA-based therapeutic approaches to further increase the efficiency of PDT.
Extracellular vesicles from triple-negative breast cancer cells promote proliferation and drug resistance in non-tumorigenic breast cells.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2018 Dec,30173296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30173296/,Purpose:Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)， an aggressive breast cancer subtype， is genetically heterogeneous which challenges the identification of clinically effective molecular makers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular signaling communication and have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role and mechanisms of EVs derived from TNBC cells in modulating proliferation and cytotoxicity to chemotherapeutic agents in non-tumorigenic breast cells (MCF10A).Methods:EVs were isolated from TNBC cell lines and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis， Western blot， and transmission electron microscopy. MCF10A cells were treated with the isolated EVs and evaluated for cell proliferation and cytotoxicity to Docetaxel and Doxorubicin by the MTT and MTS assays， respectively. Gene and miRNA expression profiling was performed in the treated cells to determine expression changes that may be caused by EVs treatment.Results:MCF10A cells treated with HCC1806-EVs (MCF10A/HCC1806-EVs) showed a significant increase in cell proliferation and resistance to the therapeutic agents tested. No significant effects were observed in the MCF10A cells treated with EVs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. Gene and miRNA expression profiling revealed 138 genes and 70 miRNAs significantly differentially expressed among the MCF10A/HCC1806-EVs and the untreated MCF10A cells， affecting mostly the PI3K/AKT， MAPK， and HIF1A pathways.Conclusion:EVs isolated from the HCC1806 TNBC cells are capable of inducing proliferation and drug resistance on the non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast cells， potentially mediated by changes in genes and miRNAs expression associated with cell proliferation， apoptosis， invasion， and migration.Keywords:Drug resistance; Exosomes; Gene expression; Proliferation; TNBC; miRNA expression.

Unfortunately， tumours often develop resistance to cisplatin， forcing scientists to look for alternatives or synergistic combinations with other drugs. In this work， we attempted to find a potential synergistic effect between cisplatin and cannabinoid delta-9-THC， as well as the high-THCCannabis sativaextract， for the treatment of HT-29， HCT-116， and LS-174T colorectal cancer cell lines. However， we found that combinations of the high-THC cannabis extract with cisplatin worked antagonistically on the tested colorectal cancer cell lines. To elucidate the mechanisms of drug interactions and the distinct impacts of individual treatments， we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of affected pathways within the colorectal cancer cell line HT-29. Our primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with each treatment modality and their potential interactions. Our findings revealed an antagonistic interaction between cisplatin and high-THC cannabis extract， which could be linked to alterations in gene transcription associated with cell death (BCL2，BAD，caspase 10)， DNA repair pathways (Rad52)， and cancer pathways related to drug resistance.Keywords:cannabis extract; cisplatin; colorectal cancer; delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
Integrating LINCS Data to Evaluate Cancer Transcriptome Modifying Potential of Small-molecule Compounds for Drug Repositioning.,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen, 2021,33109034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33109034/,"Background:Conventional high-throughput chemical screens in conjunction with genome-wide gene expression profiling proves to be successful in novel anti-cancer agent discovery and provides comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of action and off-target effects of single small-molecule compound. However， systematic evaluation on heterogeneous transcriptional responses of different cancer cell types to thousands of independent perturbations in a bioinformatics way is still limited.Method:Here， we introduce cancer transcriptome modifying potential (CTMP) which uses ""Connectivity Score"" to quantify and compare the effects of approved antineoplastic drugs on transcriptionally restoring dysregulated (both up- and down-) gene expressions at cancer state towards normal state. As a proof-of-concept， we applied this CTMP computational evaluation on > 10，000 small-molecule compounds using >200，000 Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) expression profiles generated upon 4 different cancer cell lines. We screened and proposed a candidate list of cancer transcriptome modifying therapeutics (CTMTs)， among which the approved on-market drugs are further validated using GDSC drug sensitivity data， highlighting their potential to facilitate direct antineoplastic repositioning.Results:In total， we calculated CTMPs of 85 on-market antineoplastic drugs and ~15，000 smallmolecule compounds using 253，813 transcriptomes across four cancer cell lines of lung， melanoma， prostate， and colon. Our results reveal that regardless of the chemical structure and targeted proteins majority of approved antineoplastic drugs present significant bilateral CTMPs across all 4 cancer cell lines. Bilateral CTMP-based systematic screen further indicates that candidate CTMTs are limited and most notably cancer-type specific. In particular， for each cancer cell type we proposed 3~5 CTMTs that are approved drugs with potent sensitivity data to support development in antineoplastic indications.Conclusion:Our work establishes CTMP to evaluate the antineoplastic property of small-molecule compounds and suggests CTMP-based systematic screen of cancer type-specific CTMTs as a feasible strategy in drug repositioning for precise anti-cancer purposes.Keywords:Gene signatures; cancer modifying therapeutics; drug sensitivity.; library of integrated network-based cellular signatures."
Comparative Expression Profiling Reveals Molecular Markers Involved in the Progression of Cutaneous Melanoma towards Metastasis.,Int J Mol Sci, 2023 Mar 31,37047539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047539/,Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer and often proves fatal in metastatic stages. Few treatment options are available， and its global incidence is quickly increasing. In order to gain an improved understanding of the molecular features regarding melanoma progression， we have compared gene and small non-coding RNA expression profiles from cell lines derived from primary melanoma (MelJuSo)， lymph node metastasis (MNT-1) and brain metastasis (VMM1)， representing distinct stages of malignant progression. Our preliminary results highlighted the aberrant regulation of molecular markers involved in several processes that aid melanoma progression and metastasis development， including extracellular matrix remodeling， migratory potential and angiogenesis. Moreover， bioinformatic analysis revealed potential targets of the microRNAs of interest. Confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry analysis were used for validation at the protein level. Exploring the molecular landscape of melanoma may contribute to the achievement of future efficient targeted therapy， as well as better prevention， diagnosis and clinical management.Keywords:EGFR; FFPE samples; IL1B; MAGEC1; MMP2; brain metastasis; cutaneous melanoma; lymph node metastasis; microRNAs.
Transcriptomic-Based Identification of the Immuno-Oncogenic Signature of Cholangiocarcinoma for HLC-018 Multi-Target Therapy Exploration.,Cells, 2021 Oct 25,34831096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34831096/,Cholangiocarcinomas (CHOLs)， hepatobiliary malignancies， are characterized by high genetic heterogeneity， a rich tumor microenvironment， therapeutic resistance， difficulty diagnosing， and poor prognoses. Current knowledge of genetic alterations and known molecular markers for CHOL is insufficient， necessitating the need for further evaluation of the genome and RNA expression data in order to identify potential therapeutic targets， clarify the roles of these targets in the tumor microenvironment， and explore novel therapeutic drugs against the identified targets. Consequently， in our attempt to explore novel genetic markers associated with the carcinogenesis of CHOL， five genes (SNX15，ATP2A1，PDCD10，BET1， andHMGA2)， collectively termed CHOL-hub genes， were identified via integration of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from relatively large numbers of samples from CHOL GEO datasets. We further explored the biological functions of the CHOL-hub genes and found significant enrichment in several biological process and pathways associated with stem cell angiogenesis， cell proliferation， and cancer development， while the interaction network revealed high genetic interactions with a number of onco-functional genes. In addition， we established associations between the CHOL-hub genes and tumor progression， metastasis， tumor immune and immunosuppressive cell infiltration， dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes， poor prognoses， and therapeutic resistance in CHOL. Thus， we proposed that targeting CHOL-hub genes could be an ideal therapeutic approach for treating CHOLs， and we explored the potential of HLC-018， a novel benzamide-linked small molecule， using molecular docking of ligand-receptor interactions. To our delight， HLC-018 was well accommodated with high binding affinities to binding pockets of CHOL-hub genes; more importantly， we found specific interactions of HLC-018 with the conserved sequence of the AT-hook DNA-binding motif ofHMGA2. Altogether， our study provides insights into the immune-oncogenic phenotypes of CHOL and provides valuable information for our ongoing experimental validation.Keywords:CHOL-hub gene; cholangiocarcinoma; molecular docking; receptor-ligand interaction; therapeutic resistance; tumor microenvironment.
Transcriptomics-based drug repositioning pipeline identifies therapeutic candidates for COVID-19.,Sci Rep, 2021 Jun 10,34112877,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34112877/,The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and has few effective treatments. We applied a computational drug repositioning pipeline to SARS-CoV-2 differential gene expression signatures derived from publicly available data. We utilized three independent published studies to acquire or generate lists of differentially expressed genes between control and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples. Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic， the signatures were queried against drug profiles from Connectivity Map (CMap). We validated 16 of our top predicted hits in live SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assays in either Calu-3 or 293T-ACE2 cells. Validation experiments in human cell lines showed that 11 of the 16 compounds tested to date (including clofazimine， haloperidol and others) had measurable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. These initial results are encouraging as we continue to work towards a further analysis of these predicted drugs as potential therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.
Deep representation learning of chemical-induced transcriptional profile for phenotype-based drug discovery.,Nat Commun, 2024 Jun 25,38918369,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38918369/,ificial intelligence transforms drug discovery， with phenotype-based approaches emerging as a promising alternative to target-based methods， overcoming limitations like lack of well-defined targets. While chemical-induced transcriptional profiles offer a comprehensive view of drug mechanisms， inherent noise often obscures the true signal， hindering their potential for meaningful insights. Here， we highlight the development of TranSiGen， a deep generative model employing self-supervised representation learning. TranSiGen analyzes basal cell gene expression and molecular structures to reconstruct chemical-induced transcriptional profiles with high accuracy. By capturing both cellular and compound information， TranSiGen-derived representations demonstrate efficacy in diverse downstream tasks like ligand-based virtual screening， drug response prediction， and phenotype-based drug repurposing. Notably， in vitro validation of TranSiGen's application in pancreatic cancer drug discovery highlights its potential for identifying effective compounds. We envisage that integrating TranSiGen into the drug discovery and mechanism research holds significant promise for advancing biomedicine.
Harnessing RNA sequencing for global， unbiased evaluation of two new adjuvants for dendritic-cell immunotherapy.,Oncotarget, 2017 Mar 21,28186996,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28186996/,Effective stimulation of immune cells is crucial for the success of cancer immunotherapies. Current approaches to evaluate the efficiency of stimuli are mainly defined by known flow cytometry-based cell activation or cell maturation markers. This method however does not give a complete overview of the achieved activation state and may leave important side effects unnoticed. Here， we used an unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based approach to compare the capacity of four clinical-grade dendritic cell (DC) activation stimuli used to prepare DC-vaccines composed of various types of DC subsets; the already clinically applied GM-CSF and Frühsommer meningoencephalitis (FSME) prophylactic vaccine and the novel clinical grade adjuvants protamine-RNA complexes (pRNA) and CpG-P. We found that GM-CSF and pRNA had similar effects on their target cells， whereas pRNA and CpG-P induced stronger type I interferon (IFN) expression than FSME. In general， the pathways most affected by all stimuli were related to immune activity and cell migration. GM-CSF stimulation， however， also induced a significant increase of genes related to nonsense-mediated decay， indicating a possible deleterious effect of this stimulus. Taken together， the two novel stimuli appear to be promising alternatives. Our study demonstrates how RNA-seq based investigation of changes in a large number of genes and gene groups can be exploited for fast and unbiased， global evaluation of clinical-grade stimuli， as opposed to the general limited evaluation of a pre-specified set of genes， by which one might miss important biological effects that are detrimental for vaccine efficacy.Keywords:RNA sequencing; adjuvants; dendritic cells; immunotherapy; transcriptomics.
Transcriptome profile and its partly verification of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells exposed to Yuzhizi () seed extract.,J Tradit Chin Med, 2022 Dec,36378050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36378050/,Objective:To investigate the efficacy of Yuzhizi seed extract (FAQSE) on inhibiting the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and to explore the anti-HCC action mechanism of FAQSE.Methods:Human HCC HepG2 and Huh7 cells were used to investigate the anti-HCC effect of FAQSE. 3-(4， 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2， 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to measure cell viability. Affymetrix microarray was adopted to detect the expression of transcriptome. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of each cell line were identified. For co-DEGs of both cell lines， the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were enriched using the Database for Annotation， Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)， and the network analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) was mapped using the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and Cytoscape software. Some important genes in the PPI network of co-DEGs were selected to verify by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction， Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:FAQSE decreased the viability of HepG2 and Huh7 cells. There were 211 co-upregulated and 86 co-downregualted genes in both cell lines after FAQSE treatment. The enriched GO terms of co-upregulated DEGs were primarily involved cell-cell adhesion， viral process， transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter， positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter and actin cytoskeleton organization. The GO terms of co-downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the processes of SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane， viral transcription， nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process， nonsense-mediated decay， translational initiation and rRNA processing. Main KEGG pathways of co-upregulated DEGs were endocytosis， glutathione metabolism， protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum， synaptic vesicle cycle and lysosome. The major KEGG pathways of co-downregulated DEGs were ribosome， biosynthesis of amino acids， arginine and proline metabolism， systemic lupus erythematosus and complement and coagulation cascades. The top 10 co-DEGs with high hub nodes in STRING analysis were ribosomal protein S27a， transferrin， ribosomal protein S20， ribosomal protein L9， protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B alpha， transthyretin， thioredoxin reductase 1， ribosomal protein L3， ribophorin I and ribosomal protein L24. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also co-downregulated and contained in the PPI network. The mRNA and protein expression of most verified genes was consistent with the results of co-DEGs analysis. And the AFP level was significantly reduced after FAQSE treatment.Conclusions:A series of genes and pathways of HepG2 and Huh7 cells were changed after FAQSE treatment， which might be the targets of FAQSE against HCC and worthy of further study. AFP might be important one of them.Keywords:Yuzhizi seed extract; alpha-fetoprotein; carcinoma， hepatocellular; transcriptome.
Multiplex analysis of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family and caspase 3 activation by microbead arrays.,Assay Drug Dev Technol, 2014 Apr,24735445,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24735445/,We have developed a multiplex assay to measure the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and caspase 3 activation using the Luminex platform. In this report， we show three applications for this assay. First， we used this assay to identify biomarkers for BCL2 inhibitors to obtain a quantitative measure of expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL2， BCLxL， and MCL1) in a panel of cell lines and correlated their response to BCL2/BCLxL inhibitor， ABT-263 (navitoclax). Second， we used this assay to monitor the change of MCL1 protein expression and induction of active caspase 3 after treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol. Finally， we used this assay to screen for small molecules that decrease MCL1 protein and identified new combinations with ABT-263. This method provides a quick and convenient way to measure basal expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins and monitor expression change upon drug treatment. It is also applicable for high-throughput screening for compounds that decrease the expression of these anti-apoptotic proteins.
Analysis and Validation of Differentially Expressed Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Regorafenib-Induced Cardiotoxicity.,Oxid Med Cell Longev, 2022 Sep 26,36204517,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36204517/,Background:Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) constitute a type of anticancer drugs， the underlying mechanisms of TKI-associated cardiotoxicity remain largely unknown. Ferroptosis is a regulated cell death form that implicated in several tumors' biological processes. Our objective was to probe into the differential expression of ferroptosis-related genes in regorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity through multiple bioinformatics analysis and validation.Methods and materials:Four adult human cardiomyocyte cell lines treated with regorafenib were profiled using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE146096). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using DESeq2 inR(V.3.6.3). Then， Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis， Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Enrichment Analysis， and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were used to explore DEGs' bioinformatics functions and enriched pathways. We intersected DEGs with 259 ferroptosis-related genes from the FerrDb database. Finally， the mRNA levels of differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) were validated in regorafenib-cultured cardiomyocytes to anticipate the link between DEFRGs and cardiotoxicity.Results:747，1127，773 and 969 DEGs were screened out in adult human cardiomyocyte lines A， B， D， and E， respectively. The mechanism by which REG promotes cardiotoxicity associated with ferroptosis may be regulated by PI3K-Akt， TGF-beta， and MAPK. GSEA demonstrated that REG can promote cardiotoxicity by suppressing genes and pathways encoding extracellular matrix and related proteins， oxidative phosphorylation， or ATF-2 transcription factor network. After overlapping DEGs with ferroptosis-related genes， we got seven DEFRGs and found that ATF3， MT1G， and PLIN2 were upregulated and DDIT4 was downregulated. The ROC curve demonstrated that these genes predict regorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity well.Conclusion:We identified four DEFRGs which may become potential predictors and participate in the regorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity. Our findings provide possibility that targeting these ferroptosis-related genes may be an alternative for clinical prevention and therapy of regorafenib-related cardiotoxicity.
Correlation with Apoptosis Process through RNA-Seq Data Analysis of Hep3B Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Treated with Glehnia littoralis Extract (GLE).,Int J Mol Sci, 2024 Aug 30,39273406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39273406/,Glehnia littoralisis a perennial herb found in coastal sand dunes throughout East Asia. This herb has been reported to have hepatoprotective， immunomodulatory， antioxidant， antibacterial， antifungal， anti-inflammatory， and anticancer activities. It may be effective against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However， whether this has been proven through gene-level RNA-seq analysis is still being determined. Therefore， we are attempting to identify target genes for the cell death process by analyzing the transcriptome of Hep3B cells among HCC treated with GLE (Glehnia littoralisextract) using RNA-seq. Hep3B was used for the GLE treatment， and the MTT test was performed. Hep3B was then treated with GLE at a set concentration of 300 μg/mL and stored for 24 h， followed by RNA isolation and sequencing. We then used the data to create a plot. As a result of the MTT analysis， cell death was observed when Hep3B cells were treated with GLE， and the IC50 was about 300 μg/mL. As a result of making plots using the RNA-seq data of Hep3B treated with 300 μg/mL GLE， a tendency for the apoptotic process was found. Flow cytometry and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining verified the apoptosis of HEP3B cells treated with GLE. Therefore， an increase or decrease in the DEGs involved in the apoptosis process was confirmed. The top five genes increased wereGADD45B，DDIT3，GADD45G，CHAC1， andPPP1R15A. The bottom five genes decreased wereSGK1，CX3CL1，ZC3H12A，IER3， andHNF1A. In summary， we investigated the RNA-seq dataset of GLE to identify potential targets that may be involved in the apoptotic process in HCC. These goals may aid in the identification and management of HCC.Keywords:Hep3B; RNA-sequencing; apoptotic process; liver cancer.
Transcriptome Analysis of Piperlongumine-Treated Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells Reveals Involvement of Oxidative Stress and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Pathways.,J Med Food, 2016 Jun,27119744,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27119744/,Piperlongumine (PL)， an alkaloid obtained from long peppers， displays antitumorigenic properties for a variety of human cell- and animal-based models. The aim of this study was to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms for PL anticancer effects on human pancreatic cancer cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to identify the effects of PL on the transcriptome of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells. PL treatment of pancreatic cancer cells resulted in differential expression of 683 mRNA transcripts with known protein functions， 351 of which were upregulated and 332 of which were downregulated compared to control-treated cells. Transcripts associated with oxidative stress， endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress， and unfolded protein response pathways were significantly overexpressed with PL treatment. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to validate the RNA-seq results， which included upregulation of HO-1， IRE1α， cytochrome c， and ASNS. The results provide key insight into the mechanisms by which PL alters cancer cell physiology and identify that activation of oxidative stress and ER stress pathways is a critical avenue for PL anticancer effects.Keywords:ER stress; RNA sequencing; oxidative stress; pancreatic cancer; piperlongumine; transcriptomics.
Acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to cisplatin is multifactorial with cell context-dependent involvement of resistance genes.,Cancer Gene Ther, 2016 Dec,27910856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27910856/,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal of malignancies， in large measure， due to the propensity of PDAC cells to acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. A better understanding of the molecular basis of acquired resistance is a major focus of contemporary PDAC research. We report here the results of a study to independently develop cisplatin resistance in two distinct parental PDAC cell lines， AsPC1 and BxPC3， and to subsequently examine the molecular mechanisms associated with the acquired resistance. Cisplatin resistance in both resistant cell lines was found to be multifactorial and to be associated with mechanisms related to drug transport， drug inactivation， DNA damage response， DNA repair and the modulation of apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that the two resistant cell lines employed alternative molecular strategies in acquiring resistance dictated， in part， by pre-existing molecular differences between the parental cell lines. Collectively， our findings indicate that strategies to inhibit or reverse acquired resistance of PDAC cells to cisplatin， and perhaps other chemotherapeutic agents， may not be generalized but will require individual molecular profiling and analysis to be effective.

Proliferation inhibition of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells using drugs screened by integrating a metabolic model and transcriptomic data.,Cell Prolif, 2017 Dec,28868622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28868622/,Objectives:If screening to find effective drugs is possible， the inhibition of proliferation using existing drugs can be a practical strategy to control the drug resistance of cancer. Development of a system-oriented strategy to find effective drugs was the main aim of this research.Materials and methods:An algorithm (transcriptional regulated flux balance analysis [TRFBA]) integrating a generic human metabolic model with transcriptomic data was used to identify genes affecting the growth of drug-resistant cancer cells. Drugs that inhibit activation of the target genes were found and their effect on the proliferation was experimentally evaluated.Results:Experimental assessments demonstrated that TRFBA improves the prediction of cancer cell growth in comparison with previous algorithms. The algorithm was then used to propose the system-oriented strategy to search drugs effective in limiting the growth rate of the cisplatin-resistant A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cell. Experimental evaluations resulted in the selection of azathioprine， terbinafine， hydralazine and sodium valproate that appropriately inhibit the proliferation of resistant cancer cells while minimally affecting normal cells. Furthermore， experimental data indicate that the selected drugs are synergistic and can be used in combination therapies.Conclusions:The proposed strategy was successful to identify drugs effective on the viability of resistant cancer cells. This strategy can enhance the potency of treatments for drug-resistant cancer cells and provides the possibility of using existing drugs.

CD99 Expression in Glioblastoma Molecular Subtypes and Role in Migration and Invasion.,Int J Mol Sci, 2019 Mar 6,30845661,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30845661/,Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor， with an overall survival of 17 months under the current standard of care therapy. CD99， an over-expressed transmembrane protein in several malignancies， has been considered a potential target for immunotherapy. To further understand this potentiality， we analyzed the differential expression of its two isoforms in human astrocytoma specimens， and the CD99 involved signaling pathways in glioma model U87MG cell line. CD99 was also analyzed in GBM molecular subtypes. Whole transcriptomes by RNA-Seq ofCD99-siRNA， and functional in vitro assays inCD99-shRNA， that are found in U87MG cells， were performed. Astrocytoma of different malignant grades and U87MG cells only expressed CD99 isoform 1， which was higher in mesenchymal and classical than in proneural GBM subtypes. Genes related to actin dynamics， predominantly to focal adhesion， and lamellipodia/filopodia formation were down-regulated in the transcriptome analysis， whenCD99was silenced. A decrease in tumor cell migration/invasion， and dysfunction of focal adhesion， were observed in functional assays. In addition， a striking morphological change was detected inCD99-silenced U87MG cells， further corroborating CD99 involvement in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Inhibiting the overexpressed CD99 may improve resectability and decrease the recurrence rate of GBM by decreasing tumor cells migration and invasion.Keywords:CD99; cytoskeleton; glioblastoma; migration; transcriptome.

Gene expression profiling of circulating tumor cells in breast cancer.,Clin Chem, 2015 Jan,25411184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25411184/,Background:Determining the transcriptional profile of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may allow the acquisition of clinically relevant information while overcoming tumor heterogeneity-related biases associated with use of tissue samples for biomarker assessment. However， such molecular characterization is challenging because CTCs are rare and outnumbered by blood cells.Methods:Here， we describe a technical protocol to measure the expression of >29 000 genes in CTCs captured from whole blood with magnetic beads linked with antibodies against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the carcinoma-associated mucin， MUC1， designed to be used for CTC characterization in clinical samples. Low numbers of cells (5-200) from the MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines were spiked in healthy donor blood samples and isolated with the AdnaTest EMT-1/Stem CellSelect kit. Gene expression profiles (GEPs) were obtained with the WG-DASL HT assay and compared with GEPs obtained from RNA isolated from cultured cell lines and unspiked samples.Results:GEPs from samples containing 25 or more spiked cells correlated (r = 0.95) with cognate 100-ng RNA input samples， clustered separately from blood control samples， and allowed MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells to be distinguished. GEPs with comparable technical quality were also obtained in a preliminary series of clinical samples.Conclusions:Our approach allows technically reliable GEPs to be obtained from isolated CTCs for the acquisition of biologically useful information. It is reproducible and suitable for application in prospective studies to assess the clinical utility of CTC GEPs， provided that >25 CTCs can be isolated.
Comparative and temporal transcriptome analysis of peste des petits ruminants virus infected goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,Virus Res, 2017 Feb 2,28017736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28017736/,Peste des petits ruminanats virus (PPRV)， a morbillivirus causes an acute， highly contagious disease - peste des petits ruminants (PPR)， affecting goats and sheep. Sungri/96 vaccine strain is widely used for mass vaccination programs in India against PPR and is considered the most potent vaccine providing long-term immunity. However， occurrence of outbreaks due to emerging PPR viruses may be a challenge. In this study， the temporal dynamics of immune response in goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with Sungri/96 vaccine virus was investigated by transcriptome analysis. Infected goat PBMCs at 48h and 120h post infection revealed 2540 and 2000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)， respectively， on comparison with respective controls. Comparison of the infected samples revealed 1416 DEGs to be altered across time points. Functional analysis of DEGs reflected enrichment of TLR signaling pathways， innate immune response， inflammatory response， positive regulation of signal transduction and cytokine production. The upregulation of innate immune genes during early phase (between 2-5 days) viz. interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)， tripartite motifs (TRIM) and several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected PBMCs and interactome analysis indicated induction of broad-spectrum anti-viral state. Several Transcription factors - IRF3， FOXO3 and SP1 that govern immune regulatory pathways were identified to co-regulate the DEGs. The results from this study， highlighted the involvement of both innate and adaptive immune systems with the enrichment of complement cascade observed at 120h p.i.， suggestive of a link between innate and adaptive immune response. Based on the transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR validation， an in vitro mechanism for the induction of ISGs by IRFs in an interferon independent manner to trigger a robust immune response was predicted in PPRV infection.Keywords:PBMCs; PPRV; Protein-protein interaction networks; RNA-sequencing; Transcription factors; Transcriptome.
A Core NRF2 Gene Set Defined Through Comprehensive Transcriptomic Analysis Predicts Selective Drug Resistance and Poor Multicancer Prognosis.,Antioxid Redox Signal, 2024 Dec,39028025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39028025/,ims:The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (NRF2-KEAP1) pathway plays an important role in the cellular response to oxidative stress but may also contribute to metabolic changes and drug resistance in cancer. However， despite its pervasiveness and important role， most of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) target genes are defined in context-specific experiments and analysis， making it difficult to translate from one situation to another. Our study investigates whether a core NRF2 gene signature can be derived and used to represent NRF2 activation in various contexts， allowing better reproducibility and understanding of NRF2.Results:We define a core set of 14 upregulated NRF2 target genes from 7 RNA-sequencing datasets that we generated and analyzed. This NRF2 gene signature was validated using analyses of published datasets and gene sets. An NRF2 activity score based on expression of these core target genes correlates with resistance to drugs such as PX-12 and necrosulfonamide but not to paclitaxel or bardoxolone methyl. We validated these findings in our Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) knockout cancer cell lines. Finally， our NRF2 score is prognostic for cancer survival and validated in additional independent cohorts for lung adenocarcinoma and also novel cancer types not associated with NRF2-KEAP1 mutations such as clear cell renal carcinoma， hepatocellular carcinoma， and acute myeloid leukemia.Innovation and Conclusions:These analyses define a core NRF2 gene signature that is robust， versatile， and useful for evaluating NRF2 activity and for predicting drug resistance and cancer prognosis. Using this gene signature， we uncovered novel selective drug resistance and cancer prognosis associated with NRF2 activation.Antioxid.

Oxytocin's anti-inflammatory and proimmune functions in COVID-19: a transcriptomic signature-based approach.,Physiol Genomics, 2020 Sep 1,32809918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32809918/,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic， infecting over 16 million people worldwide with a significant mortality rate. However， there is no current Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that treats coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here， we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)， we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin， an OXT agonist， and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1β and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation， attenuating T cell inhibition， and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine， both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.Keywords:COVID19; LINCS; immune; oxytocin; transcriptomic signature.

A functional module states framework reveals transcriptional states for drug and target prediction.,Cell Rep, 2022 Jan 18,35045296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35045296/,Cells are complex systems in which many functions are performed by different genetically defined and encoded functional modules. To systematically understand how these modules respond to drug or genetic perturbations， we develop a functional module states framework. Using this framework， we (1) define the drug-induced transcriptional state space for breast cancer cell lines using large public gene expression datasets and reveal that the transcriptional states are associated with drug concentration and drug targets， (2) identify potential targetable vulnerabilities through integrative analysis of transcriptional states after drug treatment and gene knockdown-associated cancer dependency， and (3) use functional module states to predict transcriptional state-dependent drug sensitivity and build prediction models for drug response. This approach demonstrates a similar prediction performance as approaches using high-dimensional gene expression values， with the added advantage of more clearly revealing biologically relevant transcriptional states and key regulators.Keywords:cell states; drug response prediction; functional states; machine learning; target prediction.

Unveiling Gene Regulatory Networks That Characterize Difference of Molecular Interplays Between Gastric Cancer Drug Sensitive and Resistance Cell Lines.,J Comput Biol, 2024 Mar,38394313,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38394313/,Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally and chemotherapy is widely accepted as the standard treatment for gastric cancer. However， drug resistance in cancer cells poses a significant obstacle to the success of chemotherapy， limiting its effectiveness in treating gastric cancer. Although many studies have been conducted to unravel the mechanisms of acquired drug resistance， the existing studies were based on abnormalities of a single gene， that is， differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Single gene-based analysis alone is insufficient to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer cells， because the underlying processes of the mechanism involve perturbations of the molecular interactions. To uncover the mechanism of acquired gastric cancer drug resistance， we perform for identification of differentially regulated gene networks between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. We develop a computational strategy for identifying phenotype-specific gene networks by extending the existing method， CIdrgn， that quantifies the dissimilarity of gene networks based on comprehensive information of network structure， that is， regulatory effect between genes， structure of edge， and expression levels of genes. To enhance the efficiency of identifying differentially regulated gene networks and improve the biological relevance of our findings， we integrate additional information and incorporate knowledge of network biology， such as hubness of genes and weighted adjacency matrices. The outstanding capabilities of the developed strategy are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. By using our strategy， we uncover gene regulatory networks that specifically capture the molecular interplays distinguishing drug-sensitive and drug-resistant profiles in gastric cancer. The reliability and significance of the identified drug-sensitive and resistance-specific gene networks， as well as their related markers， are verified through literature. Our analysis for differentially regulated gene network identification has the capacity to characterize the drug-sensitive and resistance-specific molecular interplays related to mechanisms of acquired drug resistance that cannot be revealed by analysis based solely on abnormalities of a single gene， for example， DGE analysis. Through our analysis and comprehensive examination of relevant literature， we suggest that targeting the suppressors of the identified drug-resistant markers， such as the Melanoma Antigen (MAGE) family， Trefoil Factor (TFF) family， and Ras-Associated Binding 25 (RAB25)， while enhancing the expression of inducers of the drug sensitivity markers [e.g.， Serum Amyloid A (SAA) family]， could potentially reduce drug resistance and enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy for gastric cancer. We expect that the developed strategy will serve as a useful tool for uncovering cancer-related phenotype-specific gene regulatory networks that provide essential clues for uncovering not only drug resistance mechanisms but also complex biological systems of cancer.Keywords:difference molecular interplay identification; drug resistance; gastric cancer; gene network.
Prediction of cancer dependencies from expression data using deep learning.,Mol Omics, 2021 Feb 1,33135031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33135031/,Detecting cancer dependencies is key to disease treatment. Recent efforts have mapped gene dependencies and drug sensitivities in hundreds of cancer cell lines. These data allow us to learn for the first time models of tumor vulnerabilities and apply them to suggest novel drug targets. Here we devise novel deep learning methods for predicting gene dependencies and drug sensitivities from gene expression measurements. By combining dimensionality reduction strategies， we are able to learn accurate models that outperform simpler neural networks or linear models.
Synergistic Drug Combination Prediction by Integrating Multiomics Data in Deep Learning Models.,Methods Mol Biol, 2021,32926369,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32926369/,Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance is a major challenge in cancer therapy. Synergistic drug combinations could help to overcome drug resistance. However， the number of possible drug combinations is enormous， and it is infeasible to experimentally screen all drug combinations with limited resources. Therefore， computational models to predict and prioritize effective drug combinations are important for combination therapy discovery. Compared with existing models， we propose a novel deep learning model， AuDNNsynergy， to predict the synergy of pairwise drug combinations by integrating multiomics data. Specifically， three autoencoders are trained using the gene expression， copy number， and genetic mutation data of tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then the gene expression， copy number， and mutation of individual cancer cell lines are coded using the three trained autoencoders. The physicochemical features of individual drugs and the encoded omics data of individual cancer cell lines are used as the input features of a deep neural network that predicts the synergy score of given pairwise drug combinations against the specific cancer cell lines. The comparison results showed the proposed AuDNNsynergy model outperforms， specifically in terms of rank correlation metric， four state-of-the-art approaches， namely， DeepSynergy， Gradient Boosting Machines， Random Forests， and Elastic Nets.Keywords:Deep learning models; Multiomics; Prediction methods.
Inhibition of basal cell carcinoma cells by cold atmospheric plasma-activated solution and differential gene expression analysis.,Int J Oncol, 2020 May,32319578,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32319578/,Basal cell carcinoma is a common skin tumor. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has attracted increasing attention for its antitumor effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and related mechanisms of two CAP‑activated solutions on the TE354T basal cell carcinoma and HaCat keratinocyte cell lines. Plasma‑activated solution (PAS) was prepared by CAP irradiation of DMEM and PBS. TE354T cells were treated with PAS in vitro and the effect on cell viability was evaluated by an MTT assay. The apoptosis rate was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Furthermore， western blotting and RNA‑sequencing were performed. The present results demonstrated that PAS induced apoptotic signaling in basal cell carcinoma cells， and that this effect was associated with the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore， the present study demonstrated that PAS may serve as a novel treatment for basal cell carcinoma.Keywords:CAP; PAS; BCC; ROS; RNA-sequencing; MAPK.
Transcriptome Profiling of Cardiac Glycoside Treatment Reveals EGR1 and Downstream Proteins of MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway in Human Breast Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2023 Nov 2,37958905,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37958905/,Cardiac glycosides (CGs) constitute a group of steroid-like compounds renowned for their effectiveness in treating cardiovascular ailments. In recent times， there has been growing recognition of their potential use as drug leads in cancer treatment. In our prior research， we identified three highly promising CG compounds， namely lanatoside C (LC)， peruvoside (PS)， and strophanthidin (STR)， which exhibited significant antitumor effects in lung， liver， and breast cancer cell lines. In this study， we investigated the therapeutic response of these CGs， with a particular focus on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We conducted transcriptomic profiling and further validated the gene and protein expression changes induced by treatment through qRT-PCR， immunoblotting， and immunocytochemical analysis. Additionally， we demonstrated the interactions between the ligands and target proteins using the molecular docking approach. The transcriptome analysis revealed a cluster of genes with potential therapeutic targets involved in cytotoxicity， immunomodulation， and tumor-suppressor pathways. Subsequently， we focused on cross-validating the ten most significantly expressed genes，EGR1，MAPK1，p53，CCNK，CASP9，BCL2L1，CDK7，CDK2，CDK2AP1， andCDKN1A， through qRT-PCR， and their by confirming the consistent expression pattern with RNA-Seq data. Notably， among the most variable genes， we identified EGR1， the downstream effector of the MAPK signaling pathway， which performs the regulatory function in cell proliferation， tumor invasion， and immune regulation. Furthermore， we substantiated the influence of CG compounds on translational processes， resulting in an alteration in protein expression upon treatment. An additional analysis of ligand-protein interactions provided further evidence of the robust binding affinity between LC， PS， and STR and their respective protein targets. These findings underscore the intense anticancer activity of the investigated CGs， shedding light on potential target genes and elucidating the probable mechanism of action of CGs in breast cancer.Keywords:RNA-Seq analysis; anticancer activity; breast cancer; immunoregulation; lanatoside C; peruvoside; strophanthidin.
Lipoic acid alters the microRNA signature in breast cancer cells.,Pathol Res Pract, 2024 May,38678851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38678851/,Background:Breast cancer， the deadliest disease affecting women globally， exhibits heterogeneity with distinct molecular subtypes. Despite advances in cancer therapy， the persistence of high mortality rates due to chemotherapy resistance remains a major challenge. Lipoic acid (LA)， a natural antioxidant， has proven potent anticancer properties. Yet， the impact of LA on microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in breast cancer remains unexplored.Aim:The aim of this study was to unravel the effect of LA on miRNA expression profiles in different breast cancer cell lines.Methods:The MiRCURY LNA miRNA miRNome qPCR Panel was used to compare the miRNA signature in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells treated or not with LA.Results:We identified six upregulated and six downregulated miRNAs in LA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells and 14 upregulated and four downregulated miRNAs in LA-treated MCF-7 cells compared to control cells. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that the deregulated miRNAs could alter different signaling cascades including FoxO， P53 and Hippo pathways.Conclusion:The outcome of this study provides further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefit of LA. This in turn could assist the amelioration of LA-based anticancer therapies.Keywords:Breast cancer; Lipoic acid; MicroRNA.
Ropinirole alters gene expression profiles in SH-SY5Y cells: a whole genome microarray study.,Braz J Med Biol Res, 2016 Feb,26785691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26785691/,Ropinirole (ROP) is a dopamine agonist that has been used as therapy for Parkinson's disease. In the present study， we aimed to detect whether gene expression was modulated by ROP in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cell lines were treated with 10 µM ROP for 2 h， after which total RNA was extracted for whole genome analysis. Gene expression profiling revealed that 113 genes were differentially expressed after ROP treatment compared with control cells. Further pathway analysis revealed modulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway， with prominent upregulation of PIK3C2B. Moreover， batches of regulated genes， including PIK3C2B， were found to be located on chromosome 1. These findings were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Our study， therefore， revealed that ROP altered gene expression in SH-SY5Y cells， and future investigation of PIK3C2B and other loci on chromosome 1 may provide long-term implications for identifying novel target genes of Parkinson's disease.
Human glioma cell culture: two FCS-free media could be recommended for clinical use in immunotherapy.,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim, 2009 Oct,19533255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19533255/,Immunotherapy， particularly active vaccination， may be developed as an effective and safe treatment modality for malignant gliomas， which continue to have a poor prognosis， despite advances in surgical techniques and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since no glioma-specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been discovered， autologous tumor cells or well-established glioma cell lines could be used in future vaccination protocols to induce antitumour immunity against unknown TAAs. One obstacle for clinical use of these tumour cell vaccines is related to foetal calf serum (FCS). Efforts are currently being directed toward developing FCS-free media and serum-free alternatives to culture these cell vaccines. In this study， a medium containing human serum and one serum-free medium (UltraCulture)， supplemented or not with epidermal growth factor， were tested on morphology， survival， DNA content and TAA expression of human glioma cell lines and glioma biopsy primary cultures. Their effects were compared on FCS-containing medium. Results show that， whatever the medium used， no significant variations in morphology and survival were observed. Furthermore， human serum-containing medium or UltraCulture preserved at early passage cultures the cell population of interest present in the biopsies before culture. In addition， the expression profile of eight TAAs was similar between these media. These data indicate that human serum-containing medium and UltraCulture serum-free medium could be promising candidates to produce tumour-cell vaccines.
Bioactivated Glucoraphanin Improves Cell Survival， Upregulating Phospho-AKT， and Modulates Genes Involved in DNA Repair in an In Vitro Alzheimer's Disease Model: A Network-Transcriptomic Analysis.,Nutrients, 2024 Dec 5,39683594,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39683594/,Background/objectives:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases， for which a definitive cure is still missing. Recently， natural compounds have been investigated for their possible neuroprotective role， including the bioactivated product of glucoraphanin (GRA)， the sulforaphane (SFN)， which is highly rich in cruciferous vegetables. It is known that SFN alleviates neuronal dysfunction， apoptosis， and oxidative stress in the brain. In the light of this evidence， the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular effects of SFN pre-treatment in differentiated SH-SY5Y neurons exposed to β-amyloid (Aβ).Methods:To this end， we first evaluated first cell viability via the Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay， and then we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Finally， we used a network analysis in order to understand which biological processes are affected， validating them by Western blot assay.Results:SFN pre-treatment counteracted Aβ-induced loss of cell viability. The network-transcriptomic analysis revealed that SFN upregulates genes associated with DNA repair， such asABRAXAS1，BRCA1，BRCA2，CDKN1A，FANCA，FANCD2，FANCE，NBN， andXPC.Finally， SFN also increased the phosphorylation of AKT， which is associated with DNA repair and cell survival.Conclusions:These data suggest that SFN is a natural compound that could be suitable in the prevention of AD， thanks to its neuroprotective role in increasing cell survival， potentially restoring DNA damage induced by Aβ exposure.Keywords:Alzheimer’s disease; DNA repair; cell survival; glucoraphanin; isothiocyanate; sulforaphane; transcriptomic analysis.
Effects of a combined treatment with tamoxifen and estrogen receptor beta agonists on human breast cancer cell lines.,Arch Gynecol Obstet, 2014 Jan,23907354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23907354/,Introduction:Coexpression of estrogen receptors (ER) α and β is present in about half of all breast cancer cases. Whereas ERα is a well-established target for endocrine therapy with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen， the applicability of ERβ as target in breast cancer therapy is unclear. In this study， we examined the effects of two synthetic ERβ agonists alone and in combination with tamoxifen on ERα/β-positive breast cancer cells.Methods:We treated MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cells with the ERβ agonists ERB-041 and WAY-200070 and measured the effects on cell growth. In addition， transcriptome analyses were performed by means of Affymetrix GeneChip arrays.Results:When given alone， ERβ agonists ERB-041 and WAY-200070 did not affect the growth of MCF-7 or T-47D cells. In contrast， addition of these drugs to tamoxifen increased its growth-inhibitory effect on both cell lines. This effect was more pronounced under serum-free conditions， but was also observed in the presence of serum in T-47D cells. Transcriptome analyses revealed a set of genes regulated after addition of ERβ agonists including S100A8 and CD177.Conclusion:The observed enhanced growth-inhibitory effects of a combination of tamoxifen and ERβ agonists in vitro encourage further studies to test its possible use in the clinical setting.
Identification and validation of genes associated with prognosis of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.,BMC Cancer, 2024 Aug 5,39103807,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39103807/,Purpose:To investigate the role of prognostic genes related to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer during disease progression.Method:The gene expression profile of the NCI-60 cell line was acquired through comprehensive analysis of the GEO database accession GSE116439. We performed a thorough analysis of gene expression differences in samples from seven individuals exposed to cisplatin concentrations of 0 nM compared to seven samples exposed to 15000 nM over a 24-h period. Key genes were initially identified through LASSO regression， followed by their enrichment through differential gene function analysis (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG). Subsequently， a prognostic risk model was established for these key genes. The prognostic model's performance was assessed through K-M survival curves and ROC curves. To examine the variance in immune cell infiltration between the high and low-risk groups， CIBERSORTx analysis was employed. Finally， validation of prognostic gene expression in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer was carried out using clinical samples， employing RT-qPCR and Western Blot techniques.Results:A total of 132 differential genes were found between cisplatin resistance and control group， and 8 key prognostic genes were selected by analysis， namely VPS13B， PLGRKT， CDKAL1， TBC1D22A， TAP1， PPP3CA， CUX1 and PPP1R15A. The efficacy of the risk assessment model derived from prognostic biomarkers， as indicated by favorable performance on both Kaplan-Meier survival curves and ROC curves. Significant variations in the abundance of Macrophages M1， T cells CD4 memory resting， T cells follicular helper， and T cells gamma delta were observed between the high and low-risk groups. To further validate our findings， RT-qPCR and Western Blot analyses were employed， confirming differential expression of the identified eight key genes between the two groups.Conclusion:VPS13B， TBC1D22A， PPP3CA， CUX1 and PPP1R15A were identified as poor prognostic genes of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer， while PLGRKT， CDKAL1 and TAP1 were identified as good prognostic genes. This offers a novel perspective for future advancements in ovarian cancer treatment， suggesting potential avenues for the development of new therapeutic targets.Keywords:Bioinformation; Cisplatin-resistant; Ovarian cancer; Risk score model.
Enhanced Co-Expression Extrapolation (COXEN) Gene Selection Method for Building Anti-Cancer Drug Response Prediction Models.,Genes (Basel), 2020 Sep 11,32933072,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32933072/,The co-expression extrapolation (COXEN) method has been successfully used in multiple studies to select genes for predicting the response of tumor cells to a specific drug treatment. Here， we enhance the COXEN method to select genes that are predictive of the efficacies of multiple drugs for building general drug response prediction models that are not specific to a particular drug. The enhanced COXEN method first ranks the genes according to their prediction power for each individual drug and then takes a union of top predictive genes of all the drugs， among which the algorithm further selects genes whose co-expression patterns are well preserved between cancer cases for building prediction models. We apply the proposed method on benchmark in vitro drug screening datasets and compare the performance of prediction models built based on the genes selected by the enhanced COXEN method to that of models built on genes selected by the original COXEN method and randomly picked genes. Models built with the enhanced COXEN method always present a statistically significantly improved prediction performance (adjustedp-value ≤ 0.05). Our results demonstrate the enhanced COXEN method can dramatically increase the power of gene expression data for predicting drug response.Keywords:co-expression extrapolation (COXEN); gene selection; general drug response prediction model; precision oncology.
RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis of EHMT2 functions in breast cancer.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2020 Apr 9,32033749,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033749/,For breast cancer treatment， hormone therapy is effective for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer but not for TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer). Thus， many researchers have attempted to identify more effective therapeutic candidates for all subtypes of breast cancer. In this study， we established an RNA-seq analytical pipeline to analyze the subtype-specific functions of EHMT2 in the MB231 and MCF7 cell lines. After EHMT2 knockdown， we identified subtype-specific DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and overlapping DEGs. Through GO (Gene Ontology) analysis， GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis)， and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis using the DEGs， we identified the subtype-specific functions of EHMT2 in the MB231 and MCF7 cell lines. Therefore， herein， we suggest that EHMT2 is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of all types of breast cancer.Keywords:Breast cancer; EHMT2; RNA-seq.
Functional Cross-Talking between Differentially Expressed and Alternatively Spliced Genes in Human Liver Cancer Cells Treated with Berberine.,PLoS One, 2015 Nov 25,26606055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606055/,Berberine has been identified with anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cells. Many researchers have been trying to elucidate the anti-cancer mechanisms of berberine based on differentially expressed genes. However， differentially alternative splicing genes induced by berberine might also contribute to its pharmacological actions and have not been reported yet. Moreover， the potential functional cross-talking between the two sets of genes deserves further exploration. In this study， RNA-seq technology was used to detect the differentially expressed genes and differentially alternative spliced genes in BEL-7402 cancer cells induced by berberine. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were mainly enriched in the p53 and cell cycle signalling pathway. In addition， it was statistically proven that the two sets of genes were locally co-enriched along chromosomes， closely connected to each other based on protein-protein interaction and functionally similar on Gene Ontology tree. These results suggested that the two sets of genes regulated by berberine might be functionally cross-talked and jointly contribute to its cell cycle arresting effect. It has provided new clues for further researches on the pharmacological mechanisms of berberine as well as the other botanical drugs.
A druggable targets discovery strategy for diseases (DTDS): Taking Rheumatoid arthritis as a case.,Int Immunopharmacol, 2025 Mar 6,39904046,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39904046/,Identifying effective druggable targets with disease-specific for diseases is a tremendous challenge in new drug development. However， current studies of druggable targets identification are most based on either druggability or disease-specific， lacking a combination of two factors. To further improve the accuracy of druggable targets discovery， a druggable target discovery strategy for diseases (DTDS) was proposed， which combined druggable targets prediction by machine learning and key targets identification by tissue-level and cellular-level transcriptomics analysis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)， an autoimmune disease that cannot be treated entirely， was taken as a case. First， the protein-protein interaction network was constructed as the disease background network， and the classification models were established based on the topological parameters of known RA-druggable targets with druggability and non-RA targets without therapeutic effects on RA. 168 potential druggable targets were predicted by the classification models from 264 RA-related targets. Subsequently， 40 RA-specific targets were identified by tissue-level and cellular-level transcriptomics analysis from 168 potential druggable targets. Most of them were RA-druggable targets except PSMB9 and PTPRC. Finally， PSMB9 and PTPRC were further verified by in vitro experiments. The results showed that the inhibitor of PSMB9 or PTPRC could effectively inhibit inflammation and abnormal proliferation of synovial cells， proving that PSMB9 and PTPRC were potential RA-druggable targets， and further indicating that DTDS had high accuracy. In conclusion， the DTDS strategy established in this study is reliable and has been proven in identification of potential RA-druggable targets， which is expected to provide ideas and methods for systematic discovery of potential druggable targets for diseases.Keywords:Druggable targets; Machine learning; Rheumatoid arthritis; Tissue-level and cellular-level transcriptomics; Topological characteristics.
Cannabidiol (CBD) modulates the transcriptional profile of ethanol-exposed human dermal fibroblast cells.,J Appl Genet, 2024 Dec,39466591,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39466591/,Cannabidiol (CBD) is abundant in the Cannabis sativa plant and exhibits complex immunomodulatory， anxiolytic， antioxidant， and antiepileptic properties. Several studies suggest that CBD could be used for different purposes in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-related injuries to the brain and the liver. In this study， we focused on analyzing transcriptional alterations in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) cell line challenged simultaneously with ethanol and CBD as an ethanol-protective agent. We aimed to expose the genes and pathways responsible for at least some of the CBD effects in those cells that can be related to the AUD. Transcriptome analysis was performed using HDFs cell line that expresses both cannabinoid receptors and can metabolize ethanol through alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Fibroblasts are also responsible for the progression of liver fibrosis， a common comorbidity in AUD. With the use of a cellular test， we found that CBD at the lowest applied concentration (0.75 μM) was able to stimulate depressed metabolism and reduce the level of apoptosis of cells treated with different concentrations of ethanol to the level observed in the control cells. Similar observations were made at the transcriptome level， in which cells treated with ethanol and CBD had similar expression profiles to the control cells. CBD also affects several genes connected with extracellular matrix formation (especially its collagen constituent)， which can have potential implications for， e.g.， fibrosis process.Keywords:Alcohol use disorder; CBD; Cannabidiol; Ethanol; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis.
Phenotypic Screening Combined with Machine Learning for Efficient Identification of Breast Cancer-Selective Therapeutic Targets.,Cell Chem Biol, 2019 Jul 18,31056464,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31056464/,The lack of functional understanding of most mutations in cancer， combined with the non-druggability of most proteins， challenge genomics-based identification of oncology drug targets. We implemented a machine-learning-based approach (idTRAX)， which relates cell-based screening of small-molecule compounds to their kinase inhibition data， to directly identify effective and readily druggable targets. We applied idTRAX to triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and efficiently identified cancer-selective targets. For example， we found that inhibiting AKT selectively kills MFM-223 and CAL148 cells， while inhibiting FGFR2 only kills MFM-223. Since the effects of catalytically inhibiting a protein can diverge from those of reducing its levels， targets identified by idTRAX frequently differ from those identified through gene knockout/knockdown methods. This is critical if the purpose is to identify targets specifically for small-molecule drug development， whereby idTRAX may produce fewer false-positives. The rapid nature of the approach suggests that it may be applicable in personalizing therapy.Keywords:AI; AURKA; Akt; FGFR; PKIS; TNBC; cancer cell line; dependency; drug screening; gene silencing; kinase; kinase inhibitors; machine learning; target deconvolution.
Temporal gene expression profiling of maslinic acid-treated Raji cells.,Mol Omics, 2021 Apr 19,33346776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33346776/,Maslinic acid is a novel phytochemical reported to target multiple signaling pathways. A complete gene expression profile was therefore constructed to illustrate the anti-tumourigenesis effects of maslinic acid in Raji cells across five time-points. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in maslinic acid treated Raji cells at 0， 4， 8， 12， 24 and 48 h. Extracted RNA was hybridized using the AffymetrixGeneChip to obtain expression profiles. A total of 109 genes were found to be significantly expressed over a period of 48 hours. By 12 hours， maslinic acid regulates the majority of genes involved in the cell cycle， p53 and NF-κB signaling pathways. At the same time， XAF1， APAF1， SESN3， and TP53BP2 were evidently up-regulated， while oncogenes， FAIM， CD27， and RRM2B， were down-regulated by at least 2-fold. In conclusion， maslinic acid shows an hourly progression of gene expression in Raji cells.
Direct comparison of canine and human immune responses using transcriptomic and functional analyses.,Sci Rep, 2024 Jan 26,38272935,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38272935/,The canine spontaneous cancer model is increasingly utilized to evaluate new combined cancer immunotherapy approaches. While the major leukocyte subsets and phenotypes are closely related in dogs and humans， the functionality of T cells and antigen presenting cells in the two species has not been previously compared in detail. Such information would be important in interpreting immune response data and evaluating the potential toxicities of new cancer immunotherapies in dogs. To address this question， we used in vitro assays to compare the transcriptomic， cytokine， and proliferative responses of activated canine and human T cells， and also compared responses in activated macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis following T cell activation revealed shared expression of 515 significantly upregulated genes and 360 significantly downregulated immune genes. Pathway analysis identified 33 immune pathways shared between canine and human activated T cells， along with 34 immune pathways that were unique to each species. Activated human T cells exhibited a marked Th1 bias， whereas canine T cells were transcriptionally less active overall. Despite similar proliferative responses to activation， canine T cells produced significantly less IFN-γ than human T cells. Moreover， canine macrophages were significantly more responsive to activation by IFN-γ than human macrophages， as reflected by co-stimulatory molecule expression and TNF-α production. Thus， these studies revealed overall broad similarity in responses to immune activation between dogs and humans， but also uncovered important key quantitative and qualitative differences， particularly with respect to T cell responses， that should be considered in designing and evaluating cancer immunotherapy studies in dogs.
Transcriptomic and functional pathways analysis of ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity and resistance of Burkitt lymphoma.,Oncotarget, 2016 Sep 27,27590508,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27590508/,orbate is a pro-oxidant that generates hydrogen peroxide-dependent cytotoxity in cancer cells without adversely affecting normal cells. To determine the mechanistic basis for this phenotype， we selected Burkitt lymphoma cells resistant to ascorbate (JLPR cells) and their ascorbate-sensitive parental cells (JLPS cells). Compared with JLPS cells， the increased glucose uptake in JLPR cells (with upregulated glucose transporters， increased antioxidant enzyme activity， and altered cell cycling) conferred ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity and resistance. Transcriptomic profiles and function pathway analysis identified differentially expressed gene signatures for JLPR cells and JLPS cells， which differential expression levels of five genes (ATF5， CD79B， MHC， Myosin， and SAP18) in ascorbate-resistant cells were related to phosphoinositide 3 kinase， cdc42， DNA methylation and transcriptional repression， polyamine regulation， and integrin-linked kinase signaling pathways. These results suggested that coordinated changes occurred in JLPR cells to enable their survival when exposed to the cytotoxic pro-oxidant stress elicited by pharmacologic ascorbate treatment.Keywords:Burkitt lymphoma cells; ascorbate; drug resistance; pathway analysis; transcriptomic profiles.
Genome wide profiling of dopaminergic neurons derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.,Stem Cells Dev, 2014 Feb 15,24074155,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24074155/,
Genome-wide gene expression analysis in cancer cells reveals 3D growth to affect ECM and processes associated with cell adhesion but not DNA repair.,PLoS One, 2012,22509286,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22509286/,Cell morphology determines cell behavior， signal transduction， protein-protein interaction， and responsiveness to external stimuli. In cancer， these functions profoundly contribute to resistance mechanisms to radio- and chemotherapy. With regard to this aspect， this study compared the genome wide gene expression in exponentially growing cell lines from different tumor entities， lung carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma， under more physiological three-dimensional (3D) versus monolayer cell culture conditions. Whole genome cDNA microarray analysis was accomplished using the Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 gene chip. Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) and t-test analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression profiles of 3D relative to 2D cell culture conditions. These changes affected the extracellular matrix and were mainly associated with biological processes like tissue development， cell adhesion， immune system and defense response in contrast to terms related to DNA repair， which lacked significant alterations. Selected genes were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Additionally， we show that 3D growth mediates a significant increase in tumor cell radio- and chemoresistance relative to 2D. Our findings show significant gene expression differences between 3D and 2D cell culture systems and indicate that cellular responsiveness to external stress such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutics is essentially influenced by differential expression of genes involved in the regulation of integrin signaling， cell shape and cell-cell contact.
Effect of static magnetic field on gene expression of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells by transcriptome analysis.,Adv Med Sci, 2024 Sep,38844059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38844059/,Purpose:Static magnetic fields (SMFs) induce various biological reactions and have been applied in the biological therapy of diseases， especially in combination with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and tissue engineering. However， the underlying influence of SMFs on MSCs gene expression remains largely unclear. In this study， we aim to investigate the effects of SMFs on gene expression of human MSCs.Materials and methods:We exposed human MSCs to two different intensities (0.35 ​T and 1.0 ​T) of SMFs and observed the effects of SMFs on cell morphology. Subsequently， RNA-sequencing was performed to explore the gene expression changes.Results:Compared with control group cells， no significant differences in cell morphology were observed under a phase contrast inverted microscope， but the transcriptome of SMF-exposed MSCs were significantly changed in both 0.35 ​T and 1.0 ​T groups and the differential expressed genes are involved in multiple pathways， such as ubiquitin mediated proteolysis， TNF signaling pathway， NF-kappa B signaling pathway， TGF-beta signaling pathway， metabolic pathways， and apoptosis， which regulate the biological functions of MSCs.Conclusions:SMFs stimulation could affect the gene expression of human MSCs and the biological effects vary by the different intensities of SMFs. These data offer the molecular foundation for future application of SMFs in stem cell technology as well as tissue engineering medicine.Keywords:Differentially expressed genes; Mesenchymal stem cells; Static magnetic field; Transcriptome analysis.
Differential gene-expression patterns in genital fibroblasts of normal males and 46，XY females with androgen insensitivity syndrome: evidence for early programming involving the androgen receptor.,Genome Biol, 2003,12801411,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12801411/,Background:Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) comprises a range of phenotypes from male infertility to complete feminization. Most individuals with AIS carry germline mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) that interfere with or ablate its function. As genital fibroblasts retain expression of the AR in vitro， we used genital skin fibroblasts from normal males and 46，XY females with complete AIS due to known AR mutations to gain insights into the role of the AR in human genital differentiation.Results:Using DNA microarrays representing 32，968 different genes， we identified 404 transcripts with significant differences in transcription levels between genital skin fibroblasts cultured from normal and AIS-affected individuals. Gene-cluster analyses uncovered coordinated expression of genes involved in key processes of morphogenesis. On the basis of animal studies and human genetic syndromes， several of these genes are known to have specific roles in genital differentiation. Remarkably， genital fibroblasts from both normal and AIS-affected individuals showed no transcriptional response to dihydrotestosterone treatment despite expression of the AR.Conclusions:The results suggest that in addition to differences in the anatomic origin of the cells， androgen signaling during prenatal development contributes to setting long-lasting， androgen-independent transcriptional programs in genital fibroblasts. Our findings have broad implications in understanding the establishment and the stability of sexual dimorphism in human genital development.

Identification of Kynurenic Acid-Induced Apoptotic Biomarkers in Gastric Cancer-Derived AGS Cells through Next-Generation Transcriptome Sequencing Analysis.,Nutrients, 2022 Dec 30,36615849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36615849/,Understanding the triggers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer， one of the most common cancers worldwide， can provide helpful information for the development of therapeutics. RNA sequencing technology can be utilized to identify complex disease targets and therapeutic applications. In the present study， we aimed to establish the pharmacological target of Kynurenic acid (KYNA) for gastric cancer AGS cells and to identify the biological network. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between KYNA-treated and untreated cells. A total of 278 genes were differentially expressed， of which 120 genes were up-regulated， and 158 genes were down-regulated. Gene ontology results confirmed that KYNA had effects such as a reduction in genes related to DNA replication and nucleosome organization on AGS cells. Protein-protein interaction was confirmed through STRING analysis， and it was confirmed that cancer cell growth and proliferation were inhibited through KEGG， Reactome， and Wiki pathway analysis， and various signaling pathways related to cancer cell death were induced. It was confirmed that KYNA treatment reduced the gene expression of cancer-causing AP-1 factors (Fos， Jun， ATF， and JDP) in AGS cell lines derived from gastric cancer. Overall， using next-generation transcriptome sequencing data and bioinformatics tools， we confirmed that KYNA had an apoptosis effect by inducing changes in various genes， including factor AP-1， in gastric cancer AGS cells. This study can identify pharmacological targets for gastric cancer treatment and provide a valuable resource for drug development.Keywords:AGS cells; AP-1; DEGs; RNA sequencing; next-generation sequencing.

Expression Profiles of the Individual Genes Corresponding to the Genes Generated by Cytotoxicity Experiments with Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma.,Turk J Haematol, 2016 Dec 1,27095044,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27095044/,"inEnglish，TurkishObjective:Multiple myeloma (MM) is currently incurable due to refractory disease relapse even under novel anti-myeloma treatment. In silico studies are effective for key decision making during clinicopathological battles against the chronic course of MM. The aim of this present in silico study was to identify individual genes whose expression profiles match that of the one generated by cytotoxicity experiments for bortezomib.Materials and methods:We used an in silico literature mining approach to identify potential biomarkers by creating a summarized set of metadata derived from relevant information. The E-MTAB-783 dataset containing expression data from 789 cancer cell lines including 8 myeloma cell lines with drug screening data from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute database obtained from ArrayExpress was ""Robust Multi-array analysis"" normalized using GeneSpring v.12.5. Drug toxicity data were obtained from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project. In order to identify individual genes whose expression profiles matched that of the one generated by cytotoxicity experiments for bortezomib， we used a linear regression-based approach， where we searched for statistically significant correlations between gene expression values and IC50 data. The intersections of the genes were identified in 8 cell lines and used for further analysis.Results:Our linear regression model identified 73 genes and some genes expression levels were found to very closely correlated with bortezomib IC50 values. When all 73 genes were used in a hierarchical cluster analysis， two major clusters of cells representing relatively sensitive and resistant cells could be identified. Pathway and molecular function analysis of all the significant genes was also investigated， as well as the genes involved in pathways.Conclusion:The findings of our present in silico study could be important not only for the understanding of the genomics of MM but also for the better arrangement of the targeted anti-myeloma therapies， such as bortezomib.Amaç: Multipl miyelom (MM) günümüzde uygulanan yeni MM tedavilerine rağmen， refrakter hastalığın relapsı nedeniyle kür edilemeyen bir hastalıktır. In silico çalışmalar， MM’nin kronik seyrine karşı verilen klinikopatolojik savaşta alınan kararlar açısından oldukça önemlidir. Buradaki in silico çalışmanın amacı， bortezomib için yapılmış sitotoksisite çalışmalarında ortaya çıkan genlerle eşleşen özgün genleri ortaya koymaktır. Gereç ve Yöntemler: Biz bu çalışmada， potansiyel biyobelirteçleri ortaya koymak için araştırma konusuna uygun bir şekilde türetilmiş özetleyici veri seti üreterek in silico literatür taraması gerçekleştirdik. “Wellcome Trust Sanger” enstitüsünün 8 miyelom hücre serisi de olmak üzere toplam 789 kanser hücre serisini ilaç tarama verileriyle beraber içeren E-MTAB-783 veri seti ArrayExpress’den elde edilip， GeneSpring v.12.5 kullanılarak “Robust Multi-array analysis” normalize edildi. İlaç toksisite verisi “Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer” projesinden elde edildi. Biz bu çalışmada， eşleşen genleri saptamak amacıyla， gen ekspresyon değerleri ve IC50 verileri arasındaki istatistiksel açıdan anlamlı korelasyonları lineer regresyon temelli yaklaşım uygulayarak araştırdık. Sekiz hücre serisinde gen kesişimi tespit edildi ve bu hücre serileri ileri analiz için kullanıldı. Bulgular: Kullandığımız lineer regresyon modeli sayesinde 73 genin ve bazı gen ekspresyon düzeylerinin， bortezomibin IC50 değeri ile çok yakın korelasyon gösterdiğini tespit ettik. Tüm 73 geni hiyerarşik küme analizi ile incelediğimizde， iki ana kümede toplanan hücrelerin， görece duyarlı ve dirençli hücreler olduğunu gördük. Bütün önemli genlerin moleküler yolak ve fonksiyon analizi， yolaklara dahil olan genlerle beraber incelenmiştir. Sonuç: Gerçekleştirdiğimiz bu in silico çalışmada ortaya konan veriler， MM genomiğinin anlaşılması ve bortezomib gibi hedefe yönelik miyelom tedavilerinin daha iyi yönetilebilmesi açısından önemlidir."
Compound signature detection on LINCS L1000 big data.,Mol Biosyst, 2015 Mar,25609570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25609570/,The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 big data provide gene expression profiles induced by over 10 000 compounds， shRNAs， and kinase inhibitors using the L1000 platform. We developed csNMF， a systematic compound signature discovery pipeline covering from raw L1000 data processing to drug screening and mechanism generation. The csNMF pipeline demonstrated better performance than the original L1000 pipeline. The discovered compound signatures of breast cancer were consistent with the LINCS KINOMEscan data and were clinically relevant. The csNMF pipeline provided a novel and complete tool to expedite signature-based drug discovery leveraging the LINCS L1000 resources.
Transcriptome Remodeling in Gradual Development of Inverse Resistance between Paclitaxel and Cisplatin in Ovarian Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2020 Dec 3,33287223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33287223/,Resistance to anti-cancer drugs is the main challenge in oncology. In pre-clinical studies， established cancer cell lines are primary tools in deciphering molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon. In this study， we proposed a new， transcriptome-focused approach， utilizing a model of isogenic cancer cell lines with gradually changing resistance. We analyzed trends in gene expression in the aim to find out a scaffold of resistance development process. The ovarian cancer cell line A2780 was treated with stepwise increased concentrations of paclitaxel (PTX) to generate a series of drug resistant sublines. To monitor transcriptome changes we submitted them to mRNA-sequencing， followed by the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)， principal component analysis (PCA)， and hierarchical clustering. Functional interactions of proteins， encoded by DEGs， were analyzed by building protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We obtained human ovarian cancer cell lines with gradually developed resistance to PTX and collateral sensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP) (inverse resistance). In their transcriptomes， we identified two groups of DEGs: (1) With fluctuations in expression in the course of resistance acquiring; and (2) with a consistently changed expression at each stage of resistance development， constituting a scaffold of the process. In the scaffold PPI network， the cell cycle regulator-polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2); proteins belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand and receptor family， as well as to the ephrin receptor family were found， and moreover， proteins linked to osteo- and chondrogenesis and the nervous system development. Our cellular model of drug resistance allowed for keeping track of trends in gene expression and studying this phenomenon as a process of evolution， reflected by global transcriptome remodeling. This approach enabled us to explore novel candidate genes and surmise that abrogation of the osteomimic phenotype in ovarian cancer cells might occur during the development of inverse resistance between PTX and CDDP.Keywords:chondrogenesis; cisplatin; gene expression profile; inverse resistance; network analysis; osteogenesis; osteomimicry; ovarian cancer; paclitaxel.

Zika virus infection reprograms global transcription of host cells to allow sustained infection.,Emerg Microbes Infect, 2017 Apr 26,28442752,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28442752/,Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus causally linked to neurological disorders， including congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. There are currently no targeted therapies for ZIKV infection. To identify novel antiviral targets and to elucidate the mechanisms by which ZIKV exploits the host cell machinery to support sustained replication， we analyzed the transcriptomic landscape of human microglia， fibroblast， embryonic kidney and monocyte-derived macrophage cell lines before and after ZIKV infection. The four cell types differed in their susceptibility to ZIKV infection， consistent with differences in their expression of viral response genes before infection. Clustering and network analyses of genes differentially expressed after ZIKV infection revealed changes related to the adaptive immune system， angiogenesis and host metabolic processes that are conducive to sustained viral production. Genes related to the adaptive immune response were downregulated in microglia cells， suggesting that ZIKV effectively evades the immune response after reaching the central nervous system. Like other viruses， ZIKV diverts host cell resources and reprograms the metabolic machinery to support RNA metabolism， ATP production and glycolysis. Consistent with these transcriptomic analyses， nucleoside metabolic inhibitors abrogated ZIKV replication in microglia cells.

A New Strategy for Identifying Mechanisms of Drug-drug Interaction Using Transcriptome Analysis: Compound Kushen Injection as a Proof of Principle.,Sci Rep, 2019 Nov 4,31685921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31685921/,Drug-drug interactions (DDIs)， especially with herbal medicines， are complex， making it difficult to identify potential molecular mechanisms and targets. We introduce a workflow to carry out DDI research using transcriptome analysis and interactions of a complex herbal mixture， Compound Kushen Injection (CKI)， with cancer chemotherapy drugs， as a proof of principle. Using CKI combined with doxorubicin or 5-Fu on cancer cells as a model， we found that CKI enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on A431 cells while protecting MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 5-Fu. We generated and analysed transcriptome data from cells treated with single treatments or combined treatments and our analysis showed that opposite directions of regulation for pathways related to DNA synthesis and metabolism which appeared to be the main reason for different effects of CKI when used in combination with chemotherapy drugs. We also found that pathways related to organic biosynthetic and metabolic processes might be potential targets for CKI when interacting with doxorubicin and 5-Fu. Through co-expression analysis correlated with phenotype results， we selected the MYD88 gene as a candidate major regulator for validation as a proof of concept for our approach. Inhibition of MYD88 reduced antagonistic cytotoxic effects between CKI and 5-Fu， indicating that MYD88 is an important gene in the DDI mechanism between CKI and chemotherapy drugs. These findings demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for the application of transcriptome analysis to the study of DDIs in order to identify candidate mechanisms and potential targets.

PathWave: discovering patterns of differentially regulated enzymes in metabolic pathways.,Bioinformatics, 2010 May 1,20335275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20335275/,Motivation:Gene expression profiling by microarrays or transcript sequencing enables observing the pathogenic function of tumors on a mesoscopic level.Results:We investigated neuroblastoma tumors that clinically exhibit a very heterogeneous course ranging from rapid growth with fatal outcome to spontaneous regression and detected regulatory oncogenetic shifts in their metabolic networks. In contrast to common enrichment tests， we took network topology into account by applying adjusted wavelet transforms on an elaborated and new 2D grid representation of curated pathway maps from the Kyoto Enzyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The aggressive form of the tumors showed regulatory shifts for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis as well as folate-mediated metabolism of the one-carbon pool in respect to increased nucleotide production. We spotted an oncogentic regulatory switch in glutamate metabolism for which we provided experimental validation， being the first steps towards new possible drug therapy. The pattern recognition method we used complements normal enrichment tests to detect such functionally related regulation patterns.Availability and implementation:PathWave is implemented in a package for R (www.r-project.org) version 2.6.0 or higher.

Identification of evolutionarily conserved DNA damage response genes that alter sensitivity to cisplatin.,Oncotarget, 2017 Mar 21,27863405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863405/,Ovarian， head and neck， and other cancers are commonly treated with cisplatin and other DNA damaging cytotoxic agents. Altered DNA damage response (DDR) contributes to resistance of these tumors to chemotherapies， some targeted therapies， and radiation. DDR involves multiple protein complexes and signaling pathways， some of which are evolutionarily ancient and involve protein orthologs conserved from yeast to humans. To identify new regulators of cisplatin-resistance in human tumors， we integrated high throughput and curated datasets describing yeast genes that regulate sensitivity to cisplatin and/or ionizing radiation. Next， we clustered highly validated genes based on chemogenomic profiling， and then mapped orthologs of these genes in expanded genomic networks for multiple metazoans， including humans. This approach identified an enriched candidate set of genes involved in the regulation of resistance to radiation and/or cisplatin in humans. Direct functional assessment of selected candidate genes using RNA interference confirmed their activity in influencing cisplatin resistance， degree of γH2AX focus formation and ATR phosphorylation， in ovarian and head and neck cancer cell lines， suggesting impaired DDR signaling as the driving mechanism. This work enlarges the set of genes that may contribute to chemotherapy resistance and provides a new contextual resource for interpreting next generation sequencing (NGS) genomic profiling of tumors.Keywords:DNA damage response; head and neck cancer; platinating agents; resistance.
The effect of compound kushen injection on cancer cells: Integrated identification of candidate molecular mechanisms.,PLoS One, 2020 Jul 30,32730293,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32730293/,Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations are often extracts of single or multiple herbs containing hundreds of compounds， and hence it has been difficult to study their mechanisms of action. Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) is a complex mixture of compounds extracted from two medicinal plants and has been used in Chinese hospitals to treat cancer for over twenty years. To demonstrate that a systematic analysis of molecular changes resulting from complex mixtures of bioactives from TCM can identify a core set of differentially expressed (DE) genes and a reproducible set of candidate pathways. We used in vitro cancer models to measure the effect of CKI on cell cycle phases and apoptosis， and correlated those phenotypes with CKI induced changes in gene expression. We treated two cancer cell lines with or without CKI and assessed the resulting phenotypes by employing cell viability and proliferation assays. Based on these results， we carried out high-throughput transcriptome data analysis to identify genes and candidate pathways perturbed by CKI. We integrated these differential gene expression results with previously reported results and carried out validation of selected differentially expressed genes. CKI induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in the cancer cell lines tested. In these cells CKI also altered the expression of 363 core candidate genes associated with cell cycle， apoptosis， DNA replication/repair， and various cancer pathways. Of these， 7 are clinically relevant to cancer diagnosis or therapy， 14 are cell cycle regulators， and most of these 21 candidates are downregulated by CKI. Comparison of our core candidate genes to a database of plant medicinal compounds and their effects on gene expression identified one-to-one， one-to-many and many-to-many regulatory relationships between compounds in CKI and DE genes. By identifying genes and promising candidate pathways associated with CKI treatment based on our transcriptome-based analysis， we have shown that this approach is useful for the systematic analysis of molecular changes resulting from complex mixtures of bioactives.
Mining functional relationships in feature subspaces from gene expression profiles and drug activity profiles.,FEBS Lett, 2002 Apr 10,11959115,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11959115/,In an effort to determine putative functional relationships between gene expression patterns and drug activity patterns of 60 human cancer cell lines， a novel method was developed to discover local associations within cell line subsets. The association of drug-gene pairs is an explorative way of discovering gene markers that predict clinical tumor sensitivity to therapy. Nine drug-gene networks were discovered， as well as dozens of gene-gene and drug-drug networks. Three drug-gene networks with well studied members were discussed and the literature shows that hypothetical functional relationships exist. Therefore， this method enables the gathering of new information beyond global associations.
Network assessment of demethylation treatment in melanoma: Differential transcriptome-methylome and antigen profile signatures.,PLoS One, 2018 Nov 28,30485296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485296/,Background:In melanoma， like in other cancers， both genetic alterations and epigenetic underlie the metastatic process. These effects are usually measured by changes in both methylome and transcriptome profiles， whose cross-correlation remains uncertain. We aimed to assess at systems scale the significance of epigenetic treatment in melanoma cells with different metastatic potential.Methods and findings:Treatment by DAC demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine of two melanoma cell lines endowed with different metastatic potential， SKMEL-2 and HS294T， was performed and high-throughput coupled RNA-Seq and RRBS-Seq experiments delivered differential profiles (DiP) of both transcriptomes and methylomes. Methylation levels measured at both TSS and gene body were studied to inspect correlated patterns with wide-spectrum transcript abundance levels quantified in both protein coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regions. The DiP were then mapped onto standard bio-annotation sources (pathways， biological processes) and network configurations were obtained. The prioritized associations for target identification purposes were expected to elucidate the reprogramming dynamics induced by the epigenetic therapy. The interactomic connectivity maps of each cell line were formed to support the analysis of epigenetically re-activated genes. i.e. those supposedly silenced by melanoma. In particular， modular protein interaction networks (PIN) were used， evidencing a limited number of shared annotations， with an example being MAPK13 (cascade of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli). This gene is also a target associated to the PANDAR ncRNA， therapeutically relevant because of its aberrant expression observed in various cancers. Overall， the non-metastatic SKMEL-2 map reveals post-treatment re-activation of a richer pathway landscape， involving cadherins and integrins as signatures of cell adhesion and proliferation. Relatively more lncRNAs were also annotated， indicating more complex regulation patterns in view of target identification. Finally， the antigen maps matched to DiP display other differential signatures with respect to the metastatic potential of the cell lines. In particular， as demethylated melanomas show connected targets that grow with the increased metastatic potential， also the potential target actionability seems to depend to some degree on the metastatic state. However， caution is required when assessing the direct influence of re-activated genes over the identified targets. In light of the stronger treatment effects observed in non-metastatic conditions， some limitations likely refer to in silico data integration tools and resources available for the analysis of tumor antigens.Conclusion:Demethylation treatment strongly affects early melanoma progression by re-activating many genes. This evidence suggests that the efficacy of this type of therapeutic intervention is potentially high at the pre-metastatic stages. The biomarkers that can be assessed through antigens seem informative depending on the metastatic conditions， and networks help to elucidate the assessment of possible targets actionability.
Gene expression profiling of the human carcinoma cell line A-431 after 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic treatment.,Int J Oncol, 2007 May,17390029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17390029/,The photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX， endogenously accumulated from the precursor aminolevulinic acid (ALA) as well as other less photodynamically effective intermediates， is a successful agent in photodynamic therapy. Despite encouraging clinical results， the basic mechanisms leading to cell death are not fully understood. To elucidate these fundamentals， the alteration of the gene expression pattern in the squamous cell carcinoma cell line A-431 was studied at different time-points after photodynamic treatment with ALA by cDNA-array technique. Cells were incubated for 16 h with 100 microg/ml ALA and irradiated with a fluence of 3.5 J/cm(2) resulting in 50% survival until 8 h post treatment. RNA was isolated at 1.5， 3， 5 and 8 h post treatment and from 3 controls (untreated， light only and dark)， radioactively labeled by reverse transcription with 33P-dCTP and hybridized onto macroarray PCR filters containing PCR products of 2135 genes， which were selected for relevance in carcinogenesis， stress response and signal transduction. Verification of observed expression changes was carried out by real-time RT-PCR. We found a strong induction of expression of the immediate early genes c-jun and c-fos as well as decreased expression of genes involved in proliferation such as myc， genes involved in apoptosis such as Fas associated via death domain (FADD) and the fibronectin gene for cell adhesion. An apoptosis induction rate of not more than 30% as proved by apoptosis detection assays and caused by PpIX localization in the membrane was reflected by the expression profile.
Anticancer agent shikonin is an incompetent inducer of cancer drug resistance.,PLoS One, 2013,23300986,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23300986/,Purpose:Cancer drug resistance is a major obstacle for the success of chemotherapy. Since most clinical anticancer drugs could induce drug resistance， it is desired to develop candidate drugs that are highly efficacious but incompetent to induce drug resistance. Numerous previous studies have proven that shikonin and its analogs not only are highly tumoricidal but also can bypass drug-transporter and apoptotic defect mediated drug resistance. The purpose of this study is to investigate if or not shikonin is a weak inducer of cancer drug resistance.Experimental design:Different cell lines (K562， MCF-7， and a MDR cell line K562/Adr)， after repeatedly treated with shikonin for 18 months， were assayed for drug resistance and gene expression profiling.Results:After 18-month treatment， cells only developed a mere 2-fold resistance to shikonin and a marginal resistance to cisplatin and paclitaxel， without cross resistance to shikonin analogs and other anticancer agents. Gene expression profiles demonstrated that cancer cells did strongly respond to shikonin treatment but failed to effectively mobilize drug resistant machineries. Shikonin-induced weak resistance was associated with the up-regulation of βII-tubulin， which physically interacted with shikonin.Conclusion:Taken together， apart from potent anticancer activity， shikonin and its analogs are weak inducers of cancer drug resistance and can circumvent cancer drug resistance. These merits make shikonin and its analogs potential candidates for cancer therapy with advantages of avoiding induction of drug resistance and bypassing existing drug resistance.
Validation and application of normalization factors for gene expression studies in rubella virus-infected cell lines with quantitative real-time PCR.,J Cell Biochem, 2010 May,20217898,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20217898/,Reference genes are generally employed in real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments to normalize variability between different samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate appropriate reference genes as internal controls for RT-qPCR experiments in rubella virus (RV)-infected Vero and MCF-7 cell lines using SYBR green fluorescence. The software programs geNorm and NormFinder and the DeltaDeltaC(t) calculation were used to determine the expression stability and thus reliability of nine suitable reference genes. HPRT1 and HUEL， and HUEL and TBP were identified to be most suitable for RT-qPCR analysis of RV-infected Vero and MCF-7 cells， respectively. These genes were used as normalizers for transcriptional activity of selected cellular genes. The results confirm previously published microarray and Northern blot data， particularly on the transcriptional activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the nuclear body protein SP100. Furthermore， the mRNA level of the mitochondrial protein p32 is increased in RV-infected cells. The effect on cellular gene transcription by RV-infection seems to be cell line-specific， but genes of central importance for viral life cycle appear to be altered to a similar degree. This study does not only provide an accurate and flexible tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in RV-infected cell lines. It also indicates， that the suitability of a reference gene as normalizer of RT-qPCR data and the host-cell response to RV-infection are strictly cell-line specific.
[Gene expression profiles and effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 intervention in Peyronie's disease].,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi, 2004 Feb 7,15062068,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15062068/,Objective:To demonstrate molecular insight into the pathology of Peyronie's disease (PD). A preliminary profile of differential gene expression between the PD plaque and control tunica albuginea was obtained with DNA microarrays. Also， to investigate the effect of intervention in PD cells， transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was recruited to treat PD cell lines.Methods:Three PD plaques and control tunica albugineas were constructed and studied. cDNA probes were prepared from RNA isolated from those cells and hybridized with the Clontech Atlas 3.6 Array. Relative changes of greater than 2.0 defined up-regulation and down-regulation， respectively. The expression of selected individual gene MCP-1 and the effect of TGF-beta1 on MCP-1 were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.Results:Some up-regulated genes in the PD plaque detected by the Clontech assay were screened， one of them was monocyte chemotactic protein. One involved the pathogenesis of PD as a downstream gene and responded to the TGF-beta1 treatment but not CTGF. The results were also confirmed by TR-PCR in all the types of cell.Conclusions:The cell lines from plaque tissue and normal tunica from men with PD were successfully established. The findings indicate a potential role for MCP-1 over expression in the pathogenesis of PD as a downstream gene regulated by some genes and could be a new therapeutic target in PD. The information may allow a better understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore， it may permit some strategies of therapeutic interventions combine routine methods with Chinese herbal medicine.
Expression profiles of subtracted mRNAs during cellular senescence in human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow.,Exp Gerontol, 2013 May,23466301,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23466301/,Cellular senescence is an irreversible cell cycle arrest that limits the replicative lifespan of cells. Senescence suppresses development of tumors by regulating aging factors， such as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) and telomerase. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between young human mesenchymal stem cells (Y-hMSCs) and senescent human mesenchymal stem cells (S-hMSCs). We selected positive clones that were functionally characterized by referring to public databases using NCBI BLAST tool. This search revealed that 19 genes were downregulated， and 43 genes were upregulated in S-hMSCs relative to Y-hMSCs. Among subtracted clones in Y-hMSCs， most of genes markedly were related to metabolic functions. These genes， PDIA3， WDR1， FSTL1， COPG1， LMAN1， and PDIA6， significantly downregulated. Conversely， genes for subtracted clones in S-hMSCs were mostly associated with cell adhesion. In particular， the expression levels of 9 genes， HSP90B1， EID1， ATP2B4， DDAH1， PRNP， RAB1A， PGS5， TM4SF1 and SSR3， gradually increased during senescence. These genes have not previously been identified as being related to cellular senescence， but they seemed to be potentially affected during cellular senescence.
Protective effects of equol and their polyphenolic isomers against dermal aging: microarray/protein evidence with clinical implications and unique delivery into human skin.,Pharm Biol, 2013 Nov,23862588,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23862588/,Context:Equol is a polyphenolic/isoflavonoid molecule that can be expressed as isomers. However， the characteristics of the equol isomers on dermal gene/protein expression and human skin percutaneous absorption remain unknown.Objective:Perform a comprehensive investigation on equol as: R-equol， racemic equol or S-equol to determine their differential expression of skin-related genes， quantify collagen expression and determine percutaneous absorption in human skin.Methods:Quantified: (i) gene expression/mRNA levels via gene array technology using human skin equivalents with equol exposure at 1.2% in qPCR experiments， (ii) in vitro collagen expression in human fibroblasts， and (iii) percutaneous absorption by Franz cell techniques.Results:In the qPCR studies， only three genes displayed the greatest significant expression by S-equol， whereas 16 genes displayed the greatest significant levels (either stimulation or inhibition) by R-equol and/or racemic equol， such as extracellular matrix proteins (i.e.， collagen and elastin)， nerve growth factor， aging genes [FOS， 100 A8 and A9 calcium-binding proteins， 5α-reductase type 1， and matrix metalloproteinases (1， 3， and 9)]， and inflammatory genes (e.g.， interleukin-1 alpha， interleukin-6， and cyclooxygenase-1). Collagen type I expression in fibroblasts was greater with racemic versus S-equol treatment at 1 and 10 nM. Percutaneous absorption demonstrated high sequestering in keratinocytes with subsequent accumulation/release over time.Discussion and conclusion:Overall， these results illustrate the significant differences in mirror-image molecules or isomers of equol where R-equol and/or racemic equol are better molecules for skin gene expression compared to S-equol and the percutaneous absorption of equol represents a unique epidermal reservoir delivery mechanism.
The stable traits of melanoma genetics: an alternate approach to target discovery.,BMC Genomics, 2012 Apr 26,22537248,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22537248/,"Background:The weight that gene copy number plays in transcription remains controversial; although in specific cases gene expression correlates with copy number， the relationship cannot be inferred at the global level. We hypothesized that genes steadily expressed by 15 melanoma cell lines (CMs) and their parental tissues (TMs) should be critical for oncogenesis and their expression most frequently influenced by their respective copy number.Results:Functional interpretation of 3，030 transcripts concordantly expressed (Pearson's correlation coefficient p-value < 0.05) by CMs and TMs confirmed an enrichment of functions crucial to oncogenesis. Among them， 968 were expressed according to the transcriptional efficiency predicted by copy number analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient p-value < 0.05). We named these genes， ""genomic delegates"" as they represent at the transcriptional level the genetic footprint of individual cancers. We then tested whether the genes could categorize 112 melanoma metastases. Two divergent phenotypes were observed: one with prevalent expression of cancer testis antigens， enhanced cyclin activity， WNT signaling， and a Th17 immune phenotype (Class A). This phenotype expressed， therefore， transcripts previously associated to more aggressive cancer. The second class (B) prevalently expressed genes associated with melanoma signaling including MITF， melanoma differentiation antigens， and displayed a Th1 immune phenotype associated with better prognosis and likelihood to respond to immunotherapy. An intermediate third class (C) was further identified. The three phenotypes were confirmed by unsupervised principal component analysis.Conclusions:This study suggests that clinically relevant phenotypes of melanoma can be retraced to stable oncogenic properties of cancer cells linked to their genetic back bone， and offers a roadmap for uncovering novel targets for tailored anti-cancer therapy."
Screening of differentially expressed genes in 5-fluorouracil-resistant human gastrointestinal tumor cells.,Jpn J Cancer Res, 2001 Jun,11429060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11429060/,To identify genes differentially expressed in association with resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5FU)， an mRNA differential display (DD) analysis was used to compare transcripts from the NUGC-3 human gastric tumor cell line and the NUGC-3 / 5FU / L line， which had acquired 208-fold resistance as a consequence of repeated exposure to escalating concentrations of 5FU. The 110 cDNA fragments differentially expressed in the DD analysis of either the NUGC-3 or NUGC-3 / 5FU / L cells were sequenced and subjected to a homology search， and 29 overexpressed and 22 underexpressed genes were identified in NUGC-3 / 5FU / L as a result. To confirm whether the changes in the gene expression levels in the NUGC-3 / 5FU / L cells were shared by other 5FU-resistant cells， 35 genes were analyzed by northern hybridization in 3 pairs of parent / 5FU-resistant human gastrointestinal tumor cell lines. The analysis revealed 20 overexpressed and 10 underexpressed genes in at least one of the three 5FU-resistant cells as compared with those in the parent cells. Among them， P-glycoprotein， equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1， and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase were highly expressed in two of the three 5FU-resistant cells and cytidine deaminase and integrin alpha3 were underexpressed. The acquisition of resistance to 5FU by tumor cells may result from multiple changes in cellular functions.
Novel combination of sorafenib and celecoxib provides synergistic anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in human liver cancer cells.,PLoS One, 2013 Jun 12,23776502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23776502/,Molecular targeted therapy has shown promise as a treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib， a multikinase inhibitor， recently received FDA approval for the treatment of advanced HCC. However， although sorafenib is well tolerated， concern for its safety has been expressed. Celecoxib (Celebrex®) is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor which exhibits antitumor effects in human HCC cells. The present study examined the interaction between celecoxib and sorafenib in two human liver tumor cell lines HepG2 and Huh7. Our data showed that each inhibitor alone reduced cell growth and the combination of celecoxib with sorafenib synergistically inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic antitumor activity of the combination， we investigated the expression profile of the combination-treated liver cancer cell lines using microarray analysis. Combination treatment significantly altered expression levels of 1，986 and 2，483 transcripts in HepG2 and Huh7 cells， respectively. Genes functionally involved in cell death， signal transduction and regulation of transcription were predominantly up-regulated， while genes implicated in metabolism， cell-cycle control and DNA replication and repair were mainly down-regulated upon treatment. However， combination-treated HCC cell lines displayed specificity in the expression and activity of crucial factors involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. The altered expression of some of these genes was confirmed by semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR and by Western blotting. Many novel genes emerged from our transcriptomic analyses， and further functional analyses may determine whether these genes can serve as potential molecular targets for more effective anti-HCC strategies.
Characterization of human melanoma skin cancer models: A step towards model-based melanoma research.,Acta Biomater, 2025 Jan 1,39549863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39549863/,dvancing 3D in vitro human tissue models is crucial for biomedical research and drug development to address the ethical and biological limitations of animal testing. Recently， 3D skin models have proven to be effective for studying serious skin conditions， such as melanoma. For these advanced models to be applicable in preclinical studies， thorough characterization is essential to understand their applicability and limitations. In this study， we used bioimaging and RNA sequencing to assess the architecture and transcriptomic profiles of skin models， including models with melanoma. Our results indicated that these models closely mimicked skin morphology and gene expression patterns. The full-thickness (FT) model shows a superior resemblance to the human skin， particularly in basement membrane formation and cellular interactions. The integrity of the skin-like properties and gene expression signatures of both skin and melanoma cells were preserved upon the integration of melanoma cells， establishing these models as robust platforms for cancer research. The responsiveness of the FT melanoma models to vemurafenib treatment was successfully monitored， demonstrating their validity as a reliable， reproducible， and humane tool for pharmacological testing and drug development. Furthermore， the transcriptomic data showed that skin models with cancer spheroids had upregulated genes linked to aggressive and resilient cancer behavior compared to spheroids alone. This emphasizes the importance of the microenvironment in cancer progression and suggests that 3D skin models can serve to uncover mechanisms and therapeutic targets that are not detectable in simpler systems. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces advanced， ethically sound skin and melanoma models as alternatives to animal testing in drug discovery. By thoroughly characterizing these models using bioimaging and RNA sequencing， we demonstrate their close resemblance to human skin， particularly in full-thickness models. These models not only replicate the complex cellular interactions and gene expression patterns of human tissue but also maintain robustness after melanoma integration. Our findings highlight the potential of these models in revealing cancer mechanisms and therapeutic targets， offering a significant impact on melanoma research and preclinical testing.Keywords:3D skin models; Bioimaging; Melanoma; Melanoma skin model; RNAseq.
Anti-inflammatory Effect of DNA Polymeric Molecules in a Cell Model of Osteoarthritis.,Inflammation, 2018 Mar,29302765,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29302765/,The DNA polymeric molecules polydeoxynucleotide (PDRN) and polynucleotide (PN) can be used as new alternative treatment for osteoarthritis (OA); however， the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study， we investigated the effect of PDRN and PN on gene-expression profiles in a cell model of OA using transcriptome analysis. Under hypoxic conditions， human chondrosarcoma cells were stressed for 24 h in the presence of interleukin (IL)-1β and subsequently treated with PDRN， PN， or hyaluronic acid (HA) for another 24 h， followed by transcriptome analysis. The results of the transcriptome study comprising differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Database of Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery program， which yielded Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Toll-like receptor (TLR)- and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR)-signaling pathways were related between the IL-1β group and the group treated with DNA polymeric molecules. The genes involved in the TLR- and NLR-signaling pathways were validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Among these genes， IL-6， IL-1β， IL-8， and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 were dramatically upregulated in the IL-1β group， but significantly downregulated in the group treated with DNA polymeric molecules. Specifically， PN treatment resulted in a greater decrease in the expression of these genes as compared with PDRN treatment. Both PDRN and PN treatments were involved in the anti-inflammatory response associated with OA progression， with PN treatment exhibiting additional anti-inflammatory properties relative to PDRN treatment. These results provide insight into potential therapeutic approaches involving PDRN and PN treatment of OA.Keywords:Anti-inflammatory response; DNA polymeric molecules; Osteoarthritis; Polydeoxynucleotide; Polynucleotide.
Investigation of radiation-induced transcriptome profile of radioresistant non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells using RNA-seq.,PLoS One, 2013,23533613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23533613/,Radioresistance is a main impediment to effective radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite several experimental and clinical studies of resistance to radiation， the precise mechanism of radioresistance in NSCLC cells and tissues still remains unclear. This result could be explained by limitation of previous researches such as a partial understanding of the cellular radioresistance mechanism at a single molecule level. In this study， we aimed to investigate extensive radiation responses in radioresistant NSCLC cells and to identify radioresistance-associating factors. For the first time， using RNA-seq， a massive sequencing-based approach， we examined whole-transcriptome alteration in radioresistant NSCLC A549 cells under irradiation， and verified significant radiation-altered genes and their chromosome distribution patterns. Also， bioinformatic approaches (GO analysis and IPA) were performed to characterize the radiation responses in radioresistant A549 cells. We found that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)， migration and inflammatory processes could be meaningfully related to regulation of radiation responses in radioresistant A549 cells. Based on the results of bioinformatic analysis for the radiation-induced transcriptome alteration， we selected seven significant radiation-altered genes (SESN2， FN1， TRAF4， CDKN1A， COX-2， DDB2 and FDXR) and then compared radiation effects in two types of NSCLC cells with different radiosensitivity (radioresistant A549 cells and radiosensitive NCI-H460 cells). Interestingly， under irradiation， COX-2 showed the most significant difference in mRNA and protein expression between A549 and NCI-H460 cells. IR-induced increase of COX-2 expression was appeared only in radioresistant A549 cells. Collectively， we suggest that COX-2 (also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)) could have possibility as a putative biomarker for radioresistance in NSCLC cells.
Apoptosis Induction and Gene Expression Profile Alterations of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Cells following Their Exposure to Bortezomib and Methotrexate.,PLoS One, 2017 Jan 20,28107479,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28107479/,Mycosis fungoides (MF) and its leukemic variant Sézary syndrome (SS) comprise the majority of CTCL， a heterogenous group of non-Hodgkins lymphomas involving the skin. The CTCL's resistance to chemotherapy and the lack of full understanding of their pathogenesis request further investigation. With the view of a more targeted therapy， we evaluated in vitro the effectiveness of bortezomib and methotrexate， as well as their combination in CTCL cell lines， regarding apoptosis induction. Our data are of clinical value and indicate that the bortezomib/methotrexate combinational therapy has an inferior impact on the apoptosis of CTCL compared to monotherapy， with bortezomib presenting as the most efficient treatment option for SS and methotrexate for MF. Using PCR arrays technology， we also investigated the alterations in the expression profile of genes related to DNA repair pathways in CTCL cell lines after treatment with bortezomib or methotrexate. We found that both agents， but mostly bortezomib， significantly deregulate a large number of genes in SS and MF cell lines， suggesting another pathway through which these agents could induce apoptosis in CTCL. Finally， we show that SS and MF respond differently to treatment， verifying their distinct nature and further emphasizing the need for discrete treatment approaches.
MYCL is a target of a BET bromodomain inhibitor， JQ1， on growth suppression efficacy in small cell lung cancer cells.,Oncotarget, 2016 Nov 22,27764802,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27764802/,We aimed to elucidate the effect of JQ1， a BET inhibitor， on small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) with MYCL amplification and/or expression. Fourteen SCLC cell lines， including four with MYCL amplification， were examined for the effects of JQ1 on protein and gene expression by Western blot and mRNA microarray analyses. The sensitivity of SCLC cells to JQ1 was assessed by cell growth and apoptosis assays. MYCL was expressed in all the 14 cell lines， whereas MYC/MYCN expression was restricted mostly to cell lines with gene amplification. ASCL1， a transcription factor shown to play a role in SCLC， was also expressed in 11/14 cell lines. All SCLC cell lines were sensitive to JQ1 with GI50 values ≤1.23 μM， with six of them showing GI50 values <0.1 μM. Expression of MYCL as well as MYCN， ASCL1 and other driver oncogenes including CDK6 was reduced by JQ1 treatment， in particular in the cell lines with high expression of the respective genes; however， no association was observed between the sensitivity to JQ1 and the levels of MYCL， MYCN and ASCL1 expression. In contrast， levels of CDK6 expression and its reduction rates by JQ1 were associated with JQ1 sensitivity. Therefore， we concluded that CDK6 is a novel target of JQ1 and predictive marker for JQ1 sensitivity in SCLC cells.Keywords:CDK6; JQ1; MYCL; cell cycle arrest; small cell lung cancer.
A sub-pathway-based approach for identifying drug response principal network.,Bioinformatics, 2011 Mar 1,21186246,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21186246/,Motivation:The high redundancy of and high degree of cross-talk between biological pathways hint that a sub-pathway may respond more effectively or sensitively than the whole pathway. However， few current pathway enrichment analysis methods account for the sub-pathways or structures of the tested pathways. We present a sub-pathway-based enrichment approach for identifying a drug response principal network， which takes into consideration the quantitative structures of the pathways.Result:We validated this new approach on a microarray experiment that captures the transcriptional profile of dexamethasone (DEX)-treated human prostate cancer PC3 cells. Compared with GeneTrail and DAVID， our approach is more sensitive to the DEX response pathways. Specifically， not only pathways but also the principal components of sub-pathways and networks related to prostate cancer and DEX response could be identified and verified by literature retrieval.
Endothelial transcriptomic changes induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein disclose an up-regulation of Jak-Stat pathway.,Vascul Pharmacol, 2015 Oct,26028607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26028607/,Oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) act as an etiological factor in the development of atherosclerosis by modifying the biological properties of endothelial cells through mechanisms of vascular inflammation. To deepen the oxLDL changes at cellular level， a transcriptomic analysis of human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs) treated with oxLDL was performed to identify the modified signaling pathways. Total RNA was isolated from HUAECs treated with oxLDL (100 μg/ml). Gene expression analysis was carried out using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Biological pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Microarray assay demonstrated that oxLDL strongly affected two metabolic and signaling transduction pathways: the biosynthesis of steroids， via modification of nine genes that act sequentially in this metabolic pathway， and the Jak-Stat signaling pathway acting through STAT1 and STAT2. By means of qPCR， immunoblot， RNA interference and inhibitors we demonstrate that the mechanism used by oxLDL to activate Jak-Stat signaling pathway in artery endothelial cells is mainly mediated by STAT1. These findings provide a new mechanistic framework to better understand the effects that oxLDLs exert in artery endothelial cell gene expression and provide a source of hypothesis to understand the involvement of oxLDL in diseases in which endothelial cells play a key role， such as atherosclerosis.Keywords:Atherosclerosis; Cell signaling; Endothelial cells; Gene expression; Oxidized low density lipoproteins.
Integrated assessment by multiple gene expression analysis of quercetin bioactivity on anticancer-related mechanisms in colon cancer cells in vitro.,Eur J Nutr, 2005 Mar,15309432,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15309432/,Background:Many different mechanisms are involved in nutrient-related prevention of colon cancer. In this study， a comprehensive assessment of the spectrum of possible biological actions of the bioactive compound quercetin is made using multiple gene expression analysis. Quercetin is a flavonoid that can inhibit proliferation of tumor cells and reduce the number of aberrant crypt foci， although increase of number of colon tumors was also reported.Aim of the study:In order to elucidate possible mechanisms involved in its mode of action the effect of quercetin on expression of 4000 human genes in Caco-2 cells was studied and related to functional effects.Methods:Caco-2 cells were exposed to 5 or 50 microM quercetin for 48 hours， differential expression of 4000 human genes was studied using microarrays and related to functional effects. Differentially expressed genes were categorized in seven functional groups: cell cycle and differentiation， apoptosis， tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes， cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction， transcription， signal transduction and energy metabolism. Also， cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were measured.Results:Quercetin (5 microM) downregulated expression of cell cycle genes (for example CDC6， CDK4 and cyclin D1)， downregulated cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in Caco-2 cells. After exposure to 50 microM quercetin cell proliferation decreased to 51.3% of control， and further decrease of the percentage of cells in the G1 phase coincided with an increase of the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase. Quercetin upregulated expression of several tumor suppressor genes. In addition， genes involved in signal transduction pathways like beta catenin/TCF signalling and MAPK signal transduction were influenced by quercetin.Conclusions:This study shows that large-scale gene expression analysis in combination with functional assays yields a considerable amount of information on (anti-)carcinogenic potential of food components like quercetin.

A systems biology approach to investigate the mechanism of action of trabectedin in a model of myelomonocytic leukemia.,Pharmacogenomics J, 2018 Jan,27958379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27958379/,This study was designed to investigate the mode of action of trabectedin in myelomonocytic leukemia cells by applying systems biology approaches to mine gene expression profiling data and pharmacological assessment of the cellular effects. Significant enrichment was found in regulons of target genes inferred for specific transcription factors， among which MAFB was the most upregulated after treatment and was central in the transcriptional network likely to be relevant for the specific therapeutic effects of trabectedin against myelomonocytic cells. Using the Connectivity Map， similarity among transcriptional signatures elicited by treatment with different compounds was investigated， showing a high degree of similarity between transcriptional signatures of trabectedin and those of the topoisomerase I inhibitor， irinotecan， and an anti-dopaminergic antagonist， thioridazine. The study highlights the potential importance of systems biology approaches to generate new hypotheses that are experimentally testable to define the specificity of the mechanism of action of drugs.

Characterization of the interaction between human respiratory syncytial virus and the cell cycle in continuous cell culture and primary human airway epithelial cells.,J Virol, 2011 Oct,21795354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21795354/,Viruses can modify conditions inside cells to make them more favorable for replication and progeny virus production. One way of doing this is through manipulation of the cell cycle， a process that describes the ordered growth and division of cells. Analysis of model cell lines， such as A549 cells and primary airway epithelial cells， infected with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) has shown alteration of the cell cycle during infection， although the signaling events were not clearly understood. In this study， targeted transcriptomic analysis of HRSV-infected primary airway epithelial cells revealed alterations in the abundances of many mRNAs encoding cell cycle-regulatory molecules， including decreases in the D-type cyclins and corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6 [CDK4/6]). These alterations were reflected in changes in protein abundance and/or relocalization in HRSV-infected cells; taken together， they were predicted to result in G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. In contrast， there was no change in the abundances of D-type cyclins in A549 cells infected with HRSV. However， the abundance of the G(1)/S phase progression inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) was increased over that in mock-treated cells， and this， again， was predicted to result in G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. The G(0)/G(1) phase arrest in both HRSV-infected primary cells and A549 cells was confirmed using dual-label flow cytometry that accurately measured the different stages of the cell cycle. Comparison of progeny virus production in primary and A549 cells enriched in G(0)/G(1) using a specific CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor with asynchronously replicating cells indicated that this phase of the cell cycle was more efficient for virus production.
Phenotypic screening of a library of compounds against metastatic and non-metastatic clones of a canine mammary gland tumour cell line.,Vet J, 2015 Aug,25975851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25975851/,Metastases are associated with a poor prognosis for canine mammary gland tumours (CMGTs). Metastatic and non-metastatic clones were isolated previously from a single malignant CMGT cell line. The difference in metastatic potential between the two cell lines was hypothesised to be associated with distinct cellular signalling. The aim of this study was to screen for compounds that specifically target metastatic cells in order to improve CMGT therapeutic outcomes. The two clonal cell lines were characterised by transcriptome analysis and their sensitivity to a library of 291 different compounds was compared. The metastatic clone exhibited elevated expression of molecules associated with degradation of the extracellular matrix， epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell phenotype. This was confirmed using a matrigel invasion assay and by assessment of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex inhibitors (MRCIs; rotenone， antimycin and oligomycin) significantly inhibited the growth of the metastatic clone. Although MRCIs similarly depleted mitochondrial ATP in both clones， the subsequent cellular response was different， with toxicity to the metastatic clone being independent of AMP-activated protein kinase activity. The results of this study suggest a potential utility of MRCIs as anti-tumour agents against metastatic CMGTs. Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical utility of MRCIs and to determine the association between MRCI sensitivity and malignancy.Keywords:Canine; Chemotherapy; Compound screening; Mammary gland tumour cell lines; Metastases; Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex inhibitors.
Integrative genomic analyses reveal clinically relevant long noncoding RNAs in human cancer.,Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2013 Jul,23728290,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23728290/,Despite growing appreciation of the importance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in normal physiology and disease， our knowledge of cancer-related lncRNAs remains limited. By repurposing microarray probes， we constructed expression profiles of 10，207 lncRNA genes in approximately 1，300 tumors over four different cancer types. Through integrative analysis of the lncRNA expression profiles with clinical outcome and somatic copy-number alterations， we identified lncRNAs that are associated with cancer subtypes and clinical prognosis and predicted those that are potential drivers of cancer progression. We validated our predictions by experimentally confirming prostate cancer cell growth dependence on two newly identified lncRNAs. Our analysis provides a resource of clinically relevant lncRNAs for the development of lncRNA biomarkers and the identification of lncRNA therapeutic targets. It also demonstrates the power of integrating publically available genomic data sets and clinical information for discovering disease-associated lncRNAs.

Ontological representation， integration， and analysis of LINCS cell line cells and their cellular responses.,BMC Bioinformatics, 2017 Dec 21,29322930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29322930/,Background:Aiming to understand cellular responses to different perturbations， the NIH Common Fund Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program involves many institutes and laboratories working on over a thousand cell lines. The community-based Cell Line Ontology (CLO) is selected as the default ontology for LINCS cell line representation and integration.Results:CLO has consistently represented all 1097 LINCS cell lines and included information extracted from the LINCS Data Portal and ChEMBL. Using MCF 10A cell line cells as an example， we demonstrated how to ontologically model LINCS cellular signatures such as their non-tumorigenic epithelial cell type， three-dimensional growth， latrunculin-A-induced actin depolymerization and apoptosis， and cell line transfection. A CLO subset view of LINCS cell lines， named LINCS-CLOview， was generated to support systematic LINCS cell line analysis and queries. In summary， LINCS cell lines are currently associated with 43 cell types， 131 tissues and organs， and 121 cancer types. The LINCS-CLO view information can be queried using SPARQL scripts.Conclusions:CLO was used to support ontological representation， integration， and analysis of over a thousand LINCS cell line cells and their cellular responses.Keywords:Cell line; Cell line ontology; ChEMBL; Data integration; Lincs; Ontology.
TNK2 as a key drug target for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.,Int J Biol Macromol, 2018 Nov,30036625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30036625/,Currently， few small molecular compounds are being used as therapeutic targets in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC); therefore， there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets， which could be used in the treatment of CRC. The Connectivity Map (cmap) web server was used to correlate the differentially expressed genes of CRC with the small molecular compounds related to the disease. Thus， we identified six small molecular compounds to be potentially relevant to the development of CRC. Target protein analysis revealed that TNK2 is a common target of the three small molecular compounds， which were included in the set of six small molecular compounds mentioned earlier. In addition， the continuous activation of TNK2 was observed in the development of CRC. This indicates that TNK2 may have the potential of being a key drug target in the treatment of metastatic CRC. The Molinspiration tool was used to analyze small molecular compounds， which are bound to TNK2 in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We found that a small molecular compound in protein with the PDB identification code 4EWH had higher scores in terms of kinase inhibition but lower scores in terms of other biological activity indices. This indicates that the compound had good kinase specificity， which is a key characteristic of other existing clinically approved anti-tumor small molecular compounds. By performing target protein prediction analysis， we identified 122 target proteins of the small molecular compound in 4EWH. Out of the 122 target proteins， 21 proteins showed kinase activity， including TNK2. Enrichment analysis was performed on the diseases in which these 122 target proteins were involved， and the results revealed that CRC had the highest correlation. Moreover， 47 target proteins were individually correlated with the progression of CRC. This further suggests that the small molecular compound can inhibit CRC. Thus， TNK2 was considered as a potential drug target in the treatment of metastatic CRC.Keywords:Bioinformatics; Colorectal cancer; Drug target; Small molecular compound.
Gene expression profiling reveals effects of Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) NUTT. (black cohosh) on the estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.,BMC Pharmacol, 2007 Sep 20,17880733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17880733/,Background:Extracts from the rhizome of Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh) are increasingly popular as herbal alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the alleviation of postmenopausal disorders. However， the molecular mode of action and the active principles are presently not clear. Previously published data have been largely contradictory. We， therefore， investigated the effects of a lipophilic black cohosh rhizome extract and cycloartane-type triterpenoids on the estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.Results:Both extract and purified compounds clearly inhibited cellular proliferation. Gene expression profiling with the extract allowed us to identify 431 regulated genes with high significance. The extract induced expression pattern differed from those of 17beta-estradiol or the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. We observed a significant enrichment of genes in an anti-proliferative and apoptosis-sensitizing manner， as well as an increase of mRNAs coding for gene products involved in several stress response pathways. These functional groups were highly overrepresented among all regulated genes. Also several transcripts coding for oxidoreductases were induced， as for example the cytochrome P450 family members 1A1 and 1B1. In addition， some transcripts associated with antitumor but also tumor-promoting activity were regulated. Real-Time RT-PCR analysis of 13 selected genes was conducted after treatment with purified compounds - the cycloartane-type triterpene glycoside actein and triterpene aglycons - showing similar expression levels compared to the extract.Conclusion:No estrogenic but antiproliferative and proapoptotic gene expression was shown for black cohosh in MCF-7 cells at the transcriptional level. The effects may be results of the activation of different pathways. The cycloartane glycosides and - for the first time - their aglycons could be identified as an active principle in black cohosh.

RALY regulate the proliferation and expression of immune/inflammatory response genes via alternative splicing of FOS.,Genes Immun, 2022 Dec,35941292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35941292/,RALY is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in cancer metastasis， prognosis， and chemotherapy resistance in various cancers. However， the molecular mechanism of which is still unclear. We have established RALY overexpression cell lines and studied the effect of RALY on proliferation and apoptosis in HeLa cells. Then we used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes data. Lastly， RT-qPCR experiments had performed to confirm the RNA-seq results. We found that the overexpression of RALY in HeLa cells inhibited proliferation. Moreover， the overexpression of RALY changed the gene expression profile， and the significant upregulation of genes involved immune/inflammatory response related biological process by NOD-like receptor signaling pathway cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The significant downregulation genes involved innate immune response by the Primary immunodeficiency pathway. Notably， IFIT1， IFIT2， IFTI3， IFI44， HERC4， and OASL expression had inhibited by the overexpression of RALY. Furthermore， RALY negatively regulates the expression of transcription factors FOS and FOSB. Notably， we found that 645 alternative splicing events had regulated by overexpression of RALY， which is highly enriched in transcription regulation， RNA splicing， and cell proliferation biological process by the metabolic pathway. We show that RALY regulates the expression of immune/inflammatory response-related genes via alternative splicing of FOS in HeLa cells. The novel role of RALY in regulating immune/inflammatory gene expression may explain its function in regulating chemotherapy resistance and provides novel insights into further exploring the molecular mechanism of RALY in regulating cancer immunity and chemo/immune therapies.

Gene expression profiling of taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with siRNA-mediated FOLR1 downregulation.,Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 2015 Sep 1,26617855,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26617855/,Objectives:Our previous study has shown that downregulation of FOLR1 by siRNA partially reversed taxol-resistant phenotype in taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. We aim to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of this process and identify the differentially expressed genes after FOLR1 downregulation.Method:The global gene expression profile was identified and analyzed using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array.Results:There was a significant dysregulation in the global gene expression of the FOLR1-suppressed taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. There were 41 upregulated genes and 109 downregulated genes. QRT-PCR validation of the selected differentially expressed genes demonstrated there was a good correlation with the microarray analysis. There was a significant deregulation of expression in the apoptosis-related genes such as BIRC3， PRKX， TNFRSF10A and involved in Viral carcinogenesis， MAPK signaling pathways after FOLR1 was downregulated.Conclusion:The suppression of FOLR1 by RNA interference altered gene expression profile of taxol-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. The apoptosis-related genes and the gene alterations in viral carcinogenesis， MAPK signaling pathways might be important in FOLR1 siRNA-induced taxol-resistant reversal.Keywords:FOLR1; Gene expression profiling; nasopharyngeal carcinoma; signaling pathway; small interfering RNA; taxol resistance.
Flow cytometry application for studies on adenosine A2A receptors expression.,Acta Pol Pharm, 2008 Jan-Feb,18536175,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18536175/,denosine A2A receptors belong to the heptaspanning membrane receptors family A， also known as G protein-coupled receptors. In human brain they are highly expressed in striatum， where they co-exist and co-function with adenosine A1， glutamate mGlu5 and dopamine D2 receptors. As glutaminergic neurotransmission modulators in GABAergic enkephalinergic neurons， adenosine A2A receptors are attractive targets for new， alternative therapies of neurodegenerative disorders， like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The aim of the research was to obtained fluorescently tagged adenosine A2A receptors. Gene encoding human adenosine A2A receptor was inserted into plasmid pEYFP-N1， bearing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). The construct was expressed in HEK 293 cells. Fluorescence was observed by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. Functional ligand binding properties were investigated by saturation binding analysis of adenosine A2A receptors specific agonist [3H] CGS 21680.
Genomic studies of gene expression: regulation of the Wilson disease gene.,Genomics, 2003 Jun,12782122,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12782122/,Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) have many advantages over other large-insert cloning vectors and have been used for a variety of genetic applications， including the final contigs of the human genome. We describe the utilization of a BAC construct to study gene regulation in a tissue culture-based system， using a 170-kb clone containing the entire Wilson disease (WND) locus as a model. A second BAC construct that lacked a putative negatively regulating promoter sequence was created. A nonviral method of gene delivery was applied to transfect three human cell lines stably with each construct. Our results show correct WND gene expression from the recombinant locus and quantification revealed significantly increased expression from the clone lacking the negative regulator. Comparison with conventional methods confirms the reliability of the genomic approach for thorough examination of gene expression. This experimental system illustrates the potential of BAC clones in genomic gene expression studies， new gene therapy strategies， and validation of potential molecular targets for drug discovery.
Cytotoxicity Assessment and Apoptosis-related Gene Profiling of Antibody Treated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) Cancerous Cell Lines.,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol, 2019 Oct 30,32245312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32245312/,ute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) are common acute leukemia in adults and children， respectively. In these malignancies， chemotherapy is the main treatment strategy that fails in many cases and is usually associated with adverse effects on healthy cells. In this regard， the development of new therapies is essential. Monoclonal antibodies directed to the cell surface markers of leukemic blasts may have promising consequences with minimal toxic effects on normal cells. Since cluster of differentiation 45Ra (CD45Ra) and CD123 antigens， two considered surface markers of leukemic blasts in AML and ALL respectively， are overexpressed on AML and ALL blasts， CD34+ leukemic progenitors， and AML-LSCs in comparison with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)， they were selected to be targeted; using specific monoclonal antibodies. In this project， CD45Ra+ cells and CD123+ cells were targeted by anti-CD45Ra and/or anti-CD123 monoclonal antibodies. Cytotoxicity effect and cell death induction was determined by 3-(4，5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Changes in the expression profile of MCL1， cMyc， Survivin， Id1， and PIM1 genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis of the results showed effective antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis in KG1α (CD45Ra+) and Nalm6 (CD123+) cell lines. Also， a significant change in the expression level of some of the apoptosis-related genes was observed. According to the results of this study， it can be concluded that an effective targeting of AML and ALL cancerous cell lines can be performed by anti-CD45Ra and anti-CD123 monoclonal antibodies through their effector functions and apoptosis induction.Keywords:Acute leukemia cell lines; Apoptotic genes; Cytotoxicity assessment; Immunotherapy.
Gene expression profiling predicts response to temozolomide in malignant gliomas.,Int J Oncol, 2010 Jun,20428759,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20428759/,Malignant gliomas are highly lethal neoplasms that cannot be cured with currently available therapies. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a recently introduced alkylating agent that has yielded significant benefits and become a key agent in the treatment of high-grade gliomas. However， its survival benefit remains unsatisfactory. Understanding the molecular basis of TMZ sensitivity/resistance is necessary for improving the treatment outcome by devising strategies that are able to circumvent primary drug resistance. We therefore combined the in vitro TMZ response with microarray gene expression data to identify genes that could potentially be used to predict the response of malignant gliomas to TMZ therapy. We first obtained the individual IC50 values for TMZ in seven malignant glioma cell lines (A-172， AM-38， T98G， U-87MG， U-138MG， U-251MG and YH-13) and then identified the genes whose expression correlated most highly with TMZ sensitivity employing a cDNA microarray. We present here a list of the most highly up-regulated and down-regulated genes which may be involved in conferring TMZ sensitivity/resistance in malignant gliomas， although most of the genes have not been implicated as a causal factor in the TMZ response except MGMT. We also demonstrated and confirmed the MGMT methylation status， quantitative MGMT mRNA levels， and MGMT protein expression levels in TMZ resistant glioma cells in vitro. Our results are thus consistent with previous studies and suggest that a dominant mechanism conferring sensitivity/resistance to TMZ exists in malignant glioma cells. Although the present study dose have several limitations， our reported candidate genes could represent not only potential molecular markers for TMZ sensitivity/resistance but also chemotherapy targets. Furthermore， the present study could provide a foundation for alternative therapeutic strategies including novel combination treatments that incorporate additional reagents directed at overcoming resistance to TMZ.
S-Adenosylmethionine Treatment Diminishes the Proliferation of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells by Modulating the Expression of miRNAs.,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz), 2024 Nov 1,39486056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39486056/,doMet (S-adenosylmethionine) inhibits cancer cell proliferation and migration via epigenetic alterations. This study aimed to investigate whether AdoMet may cause alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles that are important for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. PC-3 cells were treated with AdoMet before miRNA sequencing. A total of 17 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected. Target gene prediction was performed by means of databases. Results were aligned to transcriptomic data. The bioinformatic analysis revealed upregulation of anticancerogenic genes， downregulation of cancerogenic-related processes and pathways. Knocking down hsa-miR-192-5p in PC-3 cells resulted in downregulation of cancer cell proliferation， thus confirming these results.Keywords:Ado-Met; PC-3 cells; TGF-beta pathway; miRNAs.
Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) is required for the transcriptomic response of the nucleoside-derived drug 5'-DFUR in breast cancer MCF7 cells.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2006 Dec 15,16965766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16965766/,Nucleoside analogues are broadly used in cancer treatment. Although nucleoside metabolism is a necessary step in the development of their cytotoxicity， mediated transport across the plasma membrane might be needed for nucleoside-derived drugs to exert their pharmacological action. In this study， we have addressed the question of whether particular plasma membrane transporters contribute to the transcriptomic response associated with nucleoside-derived drug therapy. Firstly， we have characterized the nucleoside transporters responsible for 5'-DFUR uptake into the breast cancer cell line MCF7. 5'-DFUR is the immediate precursor of 5-FU and a metabolite of the orally administered pro-drug capecitabine， currently used in the treatment of breast cancer and other solid tumors. Although 5'-DFUR is a substrate for both plasma membrane equilibrative nucleoside carriers， hENT1 shows higher affinity for this molecule than hENT2. Inhibition of hENT1 function partially protected MCF7 cells from 5'-DFUR-induced cytotoxicity. Secondly， we have used a pharmacogenomic approach to determine how inhibition of hENT1 function contributes to the transcriptomic response associated to 5'-DFUR treatment. Under hENT1 inhibition most of the transcriptional targets of 5'-DFUR action， which were genes associated with apoptosis and cell cycle progression were blocked. This study demonstrates that although 5'-DFUR is substrate for both equilibrative nucleoside carriers， hENT1 function is essential for the full transcriptional response to 5'-DFUR treatment.
Shifting gene expression profiles during ex vivo culture of renal tumor cells: implications for cancer immunotherapy.,Oncol Res, 2003,14760862,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14760862/,The use of cultured tumor cells rather than original tumor tissue for the preparation of therapeutic cancer vaccines represents an obvious solution to the problem of availability of adequate quantities of autologous tumor. In this study we investigated possible changes in gene expression accompanying the transition of renal cell carcinoma cells from the original tissue to cell populations in culture. In our study we employed cDNA microarray technology to compare the gene expression pattern of ex vivo cultured renal carcinoma cells to that of the original solid tumor tissue from which the cells were derived. Using this approach we detected changes in the expression of many genes mostly related to the cell lines' physiological properties. Some of the products of those genes showing differential expression between tumor-derived cell line and original tumor are known human autoantigens or tumor-associated antigens. Furthermore， analysis of overexpressed genes revealed the presence of several transcripts with restricted normal tissue distribution， representing self-antigens with potential to elicit autoimmunity. Our results suggest that adapting tumor tissue to culture can result in changes in the level of transcripts specific for known antigens and that more information regarding the composition of tumor cells and their byproducts used in vaccine trials is needed before the efficacy and safety of such procedures can truly be determined.

Tanshinone IIA suppresses the progression of lung adenocarcinoma through regulating CCNA2-CDK2 complex and AURKA/PLK1 pathway.,Sci Rep, 2021 Dec 8,34880385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880385/,Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) belongs to a subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an increasing incidence all over the world. Tanshinone IIA (TSA)， an active compound of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge.， has been found to have anti-tumor effects on many tumors， but its anti-LUAD effect and its mechanism have not been reported yet. In this study， bio-information analysis was applied to characterize the potential mechanism of TSA on LUA， biological experiments were used to verify the mechanisms involved. TCGA， Pubchem， SwissTargetPrediction， Venny2.1.0， STRING， DAVID， Cytoscape 3.7.2， Omicshare， GEPIA， RSCBPDB， Chem Draw， AutoDockTools， and PyMOL were utilized for analysis in the bio-information analysis and network pharmacology. Our experiments in vitro focused on the anti-LUAD effects and mechanisms of TSA on LUAD cells (A549 and NCI-H1975 cells) via MTT， plate cloning， Annexin V-FITC and PI dual staining， flow cytometry， and western blot assays. A total of 64 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of TSA for treatment of LUAD were screened out. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed characteristic of the DEGs network. After GEPIA-based DEGs confirmation， 46 genes were considered having significant differences. Further， 10 key DEGs (BTK， HSD11B1， ADAM33， TNNC1， THRA， CCNA2， AURKA， MIF， PLK1， and SORD) were identified as the most likely relevant genes from overall survival analysis. Molecular Docking results showed that CCNA2， CDK2 and PLK1 had the lowest docking energy. MTT and plate cloning assays results showed that TSA inhibited the proliferation of LUAD cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Annexin V-FITC and PI dual staining and flow cytometry assays results told that TSA promoted the apoptosis of the two LUAD cells in different degrees， and induced cycle arrest in the G1/S phase. Western blot results showed that TSA significantly down-regulated the expression of CCNA2， CDK2， AURKA， PLK1， and p-ERK. In summary， TSA could suppress the progression of LUAD by inducing cell apoptosis and arresting cell cycle， and these were done by regulating CCNA2-CDK2 complex and AURKA/PLK1 pathway. These findings are the first to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of TSA in treatment of LUAD combination of network bio-information analysis and biological experiments in vitro.
MicroRNA-21 targets LRRFIP1 and contributes to VM-26 resistance in glioblastoma multiforme.,Brain Res, 2009 Aug 25,19559015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19559015/,MicroRNAs control a wide array of biological processes including cell differentiation， proliferation， and apoptosis whose dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in many cancers including glioblastoma and contributes to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. We investigated whether miR-21 mediated chemoresistance to the chemotherapeutic agent VM-26 in glioblastoma cells and sought to identify the candidate target genes for miR-21 by gene expression profiling. Here we report that miR-21 was involved in mediating chemoresistance to VM-26 in glioblastoma cells. Suppression of miR-21 by specific antisense oligonucleotides in glioblastoma cell U373 MG led to enhanced cytotoxicities of VM-26 against U373 MG cells. We further identified and validated LRRFIP1， whose product is an inhibitor of NF-kappaB signaling， as a direct target gene of miR-21. Our findings suggest that miR-21 represents a promising target for therapeutic manipulation to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in treating glioblastoma， a highly lethal type of cancer.
Activation and propagation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on clinical-grade designer artificial antigen-presenting cells for adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma.,J Immunother, 2014 Nov-Dec,25304728,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25304728/,"Purpose:Adoptive cell therapy with autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is a therapy for metastatic melanoma with response rates of up to 50%. However， the generation of the TIL transfer product is challenging， requiring pooled allogeneic normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) used in vitro as ""feeders"" to support a rapid-expansion protocol. Here， we optimized a platform to propagate TIL to a clinical scale using K562 cells genetically modified to express costimulatory molecules such as CD86， CD137-ligand， and membrane-bound IL-15 to function as artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) as an alternative to using PBMC feeders.Experimental design:We used aAPC or γ-irradiated PBMC feeders to propagate TIL and measured rates of expansion. The activation and differentiation state was evaluated by flow cytometry and differential gene expression analyses. Clonal diversity was assessed on the basis of the pattern of T-cell receptor usage. T-cell effector function was measured by evaluation of cytotoxic granule content and killing of target cells.Results:The aAPC propagated TIL at numbers equivalent to that found with PBMC feeders， whereas increasing the frequency of CD8 T-cell expansion with a comparable effector-memory phenotype. mRNA profiling revealed an upregulation of genes in the Wnt and stem-cell pathways with the aAPC. The aAPC platform did not skew clonal diversity， and CD8 T cells showed comparable antitumor function as those expanded with PBMC feeders.Conclusions:TIL can be rapidly expanded with aAPC to clinical scale generating T cells with similar phenotypic and effector profiles as with PBMC feeders. These data support the clinical application of aAPC to manufacture TIL for the treatment of melanoma."
Virus-specific and shared gene expression signatures in immune cells after vaccination in response to influenza and vaccinia stimulation.,Front Immunol, 2023 Aug 4,37600811,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37600811/,Background:In the vaccine era， individuals receive multiple vaccines in their lifetime. Host gene expression in response to antigenic stimulation is usually virus-specific; however， identifying shared pathways of host response across a wide spectrum of vaccine pathogens can shed light on the molecular mechanisms/components which can be targeted for the development of broad/universal therapeutics and vaccines.Method:We isolated PBMCs， monocytes， B cells， and CD8+T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors， who received both seasonal influenza vaccine (within <1 year) and smallpox vaccine (within 1 - 4 years). Each of the purified cell populations was stimulated with either influenza virus or vaccinia virus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relative to unstimulated controls were identified for eachin vitroviral infection， as well as for both viral infections (shared DEGs). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to associate identified DEGs with KEGG/biological pathways.Results:We identified 2，906， 3，888， 681， and 446 DEGs in PBMCs， monocytes， B cells， and CD8+T cells， respectively， in response to influenza stimulation. Meanwhile， 97， 120， 20， and 10 DEGs were identified as gene signatures in PBMCs， monocytes， B cells， and CD8+T cells， respectively， upon vaccinia stimulation. The majority of DEGs identified in PBMCs were also found in monocytes after either viral stimulation. Of the virus-specific DEGs， 55， 63， and 9 DEGs occurred in common in PBMCs， monocytes， and B cells， respectively， while no DEGs were shared in infected CD8+T cells after influenza and vaccinia. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that these shared DEGs were over-represented in innate signaling pathways， including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction， viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor， Toll-like receptor signaling， RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways， cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways， and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity.Conclusion:Our results provide insights into virus-host interactions in different immune cells， as well as host defense mechanisms against viral stimulation. Our data also highlights the role of monocytes as a major cell population driving gene expression inex vivoPBMCs in response to viral stimulation. The immune response signaling pathways identified in this study may provide specific targets for the development of novel virus-specific therapeutics and improved vaccines for vaccinia and influenza. Although influenza and vaccinia viruses have been selected in this study as pathogen models， this approach could be applicable to other pathogens.Keywords:gene expression signature; influenza vaccine; pathway analysis; smallpox vaccine; transcriptomic analysis; virus infection.
Identification of potential synthetic lethal genes to p53 using a computational biology approach.,BMC Med Genomics, 2013 Sep 11,24025726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24025726/,Background:Identification of genes that are synthetic lethal to p53 is an important strategy for anticancer therapy as p53 mutations have been reported to occur in more than half of all human cancer cases. Although genome-wide RNAi screening is an effective approach to finding synthetic lethal genes， it is costly and labor-intensive.Methods:To illustrate this approach， we identified potentially druggable genes synthetically lethal for p53 using three microarray datasets for gene expression profiles of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines， one next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project， and one gene expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. We selected the genes which encoded kinases and had significantly higher expression in the tumors with functional p53 mutations (somatic mutations) than in the tumors without functional p53 mutations as the candidates of druggable synthetic lethal genes for p53. We identified important regulatory networks and functional categories pertinent to these genes， and performed an extensive survey of literature to find experimental evidence that support the synthetic lethality relationships between the genes identified and p53. We also examined the drug sensitivity difference between NCI-60 cell lines with functional p53 mutations and NCI-60 cell lines without functional p53 mutations for the compounds that target the kinases encoded by the genes identified.Results:Our results indicated that some of the candidate genes we identified had been experimentally verified to be synthetic lethal for p53 and promising targets for anticancer therapy while some other genes were putative targets for development of cancer therapeutic agents.Conclusions:Our study indicated that pre-screening of potential synthetic lethal genes using gene expression profiles is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of synthetic lethal RNAi screening.
Ultrasound-induced apoptosis in the presence of Sonazoid and associated alterations in gene expression levels: a possible therapeutic application.,Cancer Lett, 2010 Feb 1,19646810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19646810/,Ultrasound (US) has been shown to induce apoptosis and cell lysis in cancer cells. In this study， we report on the potential of using Sonazoid， a new echo-contrast agent， that is chemically more stable and US-resistant in combination with US in cancer therapy. The biological effects and their mechanisms in the presence or absence of ultrasonic exposure in vitro were investigated. In addition， the impact of the agent on the expression levels of genes responsive to US was studied using global-scale microarrays and computational gene expression analysis tools. Our results show that the combination led to enhanced cell killing in the presence of 1 MHz acoustic field. The apoptosis induction was shown to be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. The occurrence of US-induced DNA damage was also observed. Despite these findings， the agent at concentrations similar to those clinically used can be considered as well tolerated. Furthermore， Sonazoid enhanced expression of genes that related to apoptosis and are responsive to US， although it alone had almost no effect. These results indicate the potential of Sonazoid for US contrast enhancement as well as the possibility of its use in US-aided therapies.
Cellular stressors may alter islet hormone cell proportions by moderation of alternative splicing patterns.,Hum Mol Genet, 2019 Aug 15,31098640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31098640/,Changes to islet cell identity in response to type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been reported in rodent models， but are less well characterized in humans. We assessed the effects of aspects of the diabetic microenvironment on hormone staining， total gene expression， splicing regulation and the alternative splicing patterns of key genes in EndoC-βH1 human beta cells. Genes encoding islet hormones [somatostatin (SST)， insulin (INS)， Glucagon (GCG)]， differentiation markers [Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)， Paired box 6， SRY box 9， NK6 Homeobox 1， NK6 Homeobox 2] and cell stress markers (DNA damage inducible transcript 3， FOXO1) were dysregulated in stressed EndoC-βH1 cells， as were some serine arginine rich splicing factor splicing activator and heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle inhibitor genes. Whole transcriptome analysis of primary T2D islets and matched controls demonstrated dysregulated splicing for ~25% of splicing events， of which genes themselves involved in messenger ribonucleic acid processing and regulation of gene expression comprised the largest group. Approximately 5% of EndoC-βH1 cells exposed to these factors gained SST positivity in vitro. An increased area of SST staining was also observed ex vivo in pancreas sections recovered at autopsy from donors with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or T2D (9.3% for T1D and 3% for T2D， respectively compared with 1% in controls). Removal of the stressful stimulus or treatment with the AKT Serine/Threonine kinase inhibitor SH-6 restored splicing factor expression and reversed both hormone staining effects and patterns of gene expression. This suggests that reversible changes in hormone expression may occur during exposure to diabetomimetic cellular stressors， which may be mediated by changes in splicing regulation.
Downregulation of growth differentiation factor-15 in trichostatin A-induced apoptosis could play a role in progression of gastric cancer.,Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 2015 Jul 1,26339382,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26339382/,im:To investigate the effect of trichostatin A (TSA) on gastric cancer cell line BGC-823， and identify the differentially expressed genes induced by TSA， which might participate in the progression of gastric cancer.Methods:MTT， fluorescence microscopy， and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of TSA on growth inhibition and apoptosis of BGC-823 cells. Using gene microarray， we analyzed the changes in gene expression. Change in growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) was verified by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The expression of GDF-15 in gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry.Results:Apoptosis of BGC-823 cells induced by TSA (75 ng/mL for 48 h) was demonstrated by flow cytometry. There were significant variations between TSA treated groups and control groups (P = 0.02). Nuclear chromatin condensation and fluorescence intensity were observed by fluorescence microscopy. GDF-15 gene expression and protein level were significantly reduced in the TSA treated group (75 ng/mL for 48 h). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of GDF-15 in gastric adenocarcinoma was significantly higher than in the surrounding normal tissues (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Lower GDF-15 gene expression due to TSA-induced apoptosis was found in gastric cancer cell line BGC-823. Higher GDF-15 gene expression was seen in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues.Keywords:BGC-823; Gastric cancer; apoptosis; growth differentiation factor-15; trichostatin A.
Exploring novel targets of basal-like breast carcinoma by comparative gene profiling and mechanism analysis.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2013 Aug,23933801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23933801/,The heterogeneity of breast cancer makes its diagnosis and treatment far from being optimal. Analysis of traditional pathological and prognostic markers based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) is inadequate in elucidating the inherent heterogeneity of breast cancer， especially basal-like breast carcinoma (BLBC) which displays complex and unique epidemiological， phenotypic， and molecular features with distinctive relapse patterns and poor clinical outcomes. Gene expression profiling opened an avenue in research as independent predictors by classifying breast cancers into discrete groups with prognostic references， but it is not cost-effective in clinical application. It is necessary to develop an effective predictive gene list from gene profiling to optimize the treatment with traditional markers. In this report， we analyzed the correlation between IHC and gene profiling of breast cancer with an emphasis on the BLBC， highlighting the potential discovery of diagnostic markers and cellular mechanisms that may guide the development of BLBC-targeted therapy. Random forest-based classification and PAM50 gene-sets were used in the comparison analysis of traditional prognostic markers including estrogen receptor (ER)， progesterone receptor (PR)， human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)， and microarray profiles. An intrinsic 40-gene set was developed to classify breast cancer subtypes， and genes expression differentiations were used to explore the different mechanisms between the BLBC and non-BLBC subtypes based on the comparison of clinicopathological markers and microarray profiling. Pathways and DNA repairs were analyzed to evaluate the biological mechanisms in BLBC and other breast cancer subtypes. It is reasonable to define BLBC as those tumors that are negative for ER， PR， and HER2 by IHC for their accordance with gene expression profiles. Focal adhesion kinase， ERBB， and their signaling pathways may play crucial role in BLBC. The intrinsic 40-gene set can be used to classify breast cancer and help to optimize therapeutic management of BLBC.
Differential disruption of cell cycle pathways in small cell and non-small cell lung cancer.,Br J Cancer, 2006 Jun 19,16705311,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16705311/,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world， with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprising the two major cell types. Although these cell types can be distinguished readily at the histological level， knowledge of their underlying molecular differences is very limited. In this study， we compared 14 SCLC cell lines against 27 NSCLC cell lines using an integrated array comparative genomic hybridisation and gene expression profiling approach to identify subtype-specific disruptions. Using stringent criteria， we have identified 159 of the genes that are responsible for the different biology of these cell types. Sorting of these genes by their biological functions revealed the differential disruption of key components involved in cell cycle pathways. Our novel comparative combined genome and transcriptome analysis not only identified differentially altered genes， but also revealed that certain shared pathways are preferentially disrupted at different steps in these cell types. Small cell lung cancer exhibited increased expression of MRP5， activation of Wnt pathway inhibitors， and upregulation of p38 MAPK activating genes， while NSCLC showed downregulation of CDKN2A， and upregulation of MAPK9 and EGFR. This information suggests that cell cycle upregulation in SCLC and NSCLC occurs through drastically different mechanisms， highlighting the need for differential molecular target selection in the treatment of these cancers.

MicroRNA signatures in chemotherapy resistant esophageal cancer cell lines.,World J Gastroenterol, 2014 Oct 28,25356050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25356050/,im:To investigate expression of microRNA (miRNA) and potential targets in chemotherapy resistant esophageal cancer cell lines.Methods:An in-vitro model of acquired chemotherapy resistance in esophageal adeno- (EAC) and squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells was used， and microRNA expression profiles for cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistant variants vs chemotherapy sensitive controls were compared using microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The expression of chemotherapy-relevant genes potentially targeted by the dysregulated microRNAs in the chemotherapy resistant variants was also evaluated.Results:Chemotherapy resistant sublines were found to have specific miRNA signatures， and these miRNA signatures were different for the cisplatin vs 5-FU resistant cells from the same tumor cell line， and also for EAC vs ESCC cells with resistance to the same specific chemotherapy agent. Amongst others， miR-27b-3p， miR-193b-3p， miR-192-5p， miR-378 a-3p， miR-125a-5p and miR-18a-3p were dysregulated， consistent with negative posttranscriptional control of KRAS， TYMS， ABCC3， CBL-B and ERBB2 expression via these miRNAs.Conclusion:The current study supports the hypothesis that microRNA expression has an impact on chemotherapy resistance in esophageal cancer.Keywords:Chemotherapy; Esophageal cancer; MicroRNA; Resistance; Target.
Transcriptome Highlights Cannabinol Modulation of Mitophagy in a Parkinson's Disease In Vitro Model.,Biomolecules, 2023 Jul 25,37627228,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37627228/,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates， known as Lewy bodies. It is known that mitochondria dysfunctions， including impaired localization， transport and mitophagy， represent features of PD. Cannabinoids are arising as new therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases. In this study， we aimed to evaluate the potential protective effects of cannabinol (CBN) pre-treatment in an in vitro PD model， namely retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). With this aim， we performed a transcriptomic analysis through next-generation sequencing. We found that CBN counteracted the loss of cell viability caused by MPP+treatment. Then， we focused on biological processes relative to mitochondria functions and found that CBN pre-treatment was able to attenuate the MPP+-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in mitochondria transport， localization and protein targeting. Notably， MPP+treatment increased the expression of the genes involved in PINK1/Parkin mitophagy， while CBN pre-treatment reduced their expression. The results suggested that CBN can exert a protection against MPP+induced mitochondria impairment.Keywords:Parkinson’s disease; cannabinol; mitochondria; mitophagy.
Alterations of metastasis-related genes identified using an oligonucleotide microarray of genistein-treated HCC1395 breast cancer cells.,Nutr Cancer, 2007,17640171,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17640171/,Genistein， one of the major isoflavones， potently inhibits the growth and metastasis of breast cancer. However， the precise molecular mechanism in metastasis inhibition is not clear. We investigated the effect of genistein in HCC1395 cells， a cell line derived from an early-stage primary breast cancer. Genistein dose dependently both decreased cell viability and inhibited the invasion potential. We used human oligonucleotide microarrays to determine the gene expression profile altered by genistein treatment. TFPI-2， ATF3， DNMT1， and MTCBP-1， which inhibit invasion and metastasis， were upregulated， and MMP-2， MMP-7， and CXCL12， which promote invasion and metastasis， were downregulated. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to verify the microarray data at the mRNA level. We conclude that genistein-induced alternations of gene expression involving metastasis may be exploited for devising chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies， particularly for early-stage breast cancer.
Synergistic enhancement of apoptosis by coralyne and paclitaxel in combination on MDA-MB-231 a triple-negative breast cancer cell line.,J Cell Biochem, 2019 Oct,31172606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31172606/,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most outrageous subtype of breast cancer. Emphasizing the urge of new approach in cancer therapy， combinational drug therapy may be proven as an effective strategy. In our previous study， we reported that coralyne (COR) with paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently decreases the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 compared with MCF-7 cell line. Thus， we studied the effect of COR and PTX in combination on apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cell line. In silico results demonstrated that COR intercalates DNA at a minor groove. In vitro approaches revealed that in combination (COR and PTX) increases the efficacy of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cell line by a significant increase in G1/S phase arrest， DNA fragmentation， and change in mitochondria membrane potential. The expression of ATM and ATR a serine/threonine-protein kinase， ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein were depleted with an increase in time from 24 to 48 hours in concurrent with increased levels of γH2AX indicating that DNA damage routes cells to enter apoptosis. This was confirmed by high levels of caspase-3 and cytochrome c. Also， the decrease in the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 confirmed the antimetastatic efficacy of COR + PTX. The present study indicates that the synergistic effect of COR and PTX can enhance apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cell line and may be proven as a potential anticancer therapy against TNBC.Keywords:AKT; ATM; apoptosis; caspase; metastasis.

Identification of key antifibrotic targets FPR1， TAS2R5， and LRP2BP of valsartan in diabetic nephropathy: A transcriptomics-driven study integrating machine learning， molecular docking， and dynamics simulations.,Int J Biol Macromol, 2025 Mar,39814306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39814306/,Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes and a leading cause of renal failure. While valsartan has been shown to alleviate DN clinically， its antifibrotic mechanisms require further investigation. This study used a transcriptomics-driven approach， integrating in vitro， Machine Learning， molecular docking， dynamics simulations and RT-qCPR to identify key antifibrotic targets. In vitro experiments demonstrated that valsartan combats fibrosis by reversing the mRNA expression levels of fibrosis markers. PCA， t-SNE and UMAP analyses suggest the effectiveness of valsartan in modifying gene expression patterns related to fibrosis. Differential expression analysis identified key fibrosis-related genes， while WGCNA highlighted DN-associated genes in human kidney samples， with 33 potential antifibrotic targets emerging from their intersection. To enhance the accuracy of key targets selection， multiple Machine Learning algorithms-LASSO， SVM-RFE， and XGBoost-were employed， refining the potential antifibrotic targets. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed strong interactions between valsartan and targets， with RT-qPCR validating their expression reversal. GSEA indicated involvement in RAS， AGE-RAGE， TGF-beta， and PI3K-Akt pathways， affecting oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial regulation. These findings provide insight into therapeutic mechanisms of valsartan and demonstrate the potential of transcriptomics-driven approaches in developing targeted DN treatments.Keywords:Antifibrotic targets; Diabetic nephropathy; Machine learning; Transcriptomics analyses; Valsartan.
Data Mining Approaches for Genomic Biomarker Development: Applications Using Drug Screening Data from the Cancer Genome Project and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.,PLoS One, 2015 Jul 1,26132924,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26132924/,Developing reliable biomarkers of tumor cell drug sensitivity and resistance can guide hypothesis-driven basic science research and influence pre-therapy clinical decisions. A popular strategy for developing biomarkers uses characterizations of human tumor samples against a range of cancer drug responses that correlate with genomic change; developed largely from the efforts of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Sanger Cancer Genome Project (CGP). The purpose of this study is to provide an independent analysis of this data that aims to vet existing and add novel perspectives to biomarker discoveries and applications. Existing and alternative data mining and statistical methods will be used to a) evaluate drug responses of compounds with similar mechanism of action (MOA)， b) examine measures of gene expression (GE)， copy number (CN) and mutation status (MUT) biomarkers， combined with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)， for hypothesizing biological processes important for drug response， c) conduct global comparisons of GE， CN and MUT as biomarkers across all drugs screened in the CGP dataset， and d) assess the positive predictive power of CGP-derived GE biomarkers as predictors of drug response in CCLE tumor cells. The perspectives derived from individual and global examinations of GEs， MUTs and CNs confirm existing and reveal unique and shared roles for these biomarkers in tumor cell drug sensitivity and resistance. Applications of CGP-derived genomic biomarkers to predict the drug response of CCLE tumor cells finds a highly significant ROC， with a positive predictive power of 0.78. The results of this study expand the available data mining and analysis methods for genomic biomarker development and provide additional support for using biomarkers to guide hypothesis-driven basic science research and pre-therapy clinical decisions.
Monocyte subsets exhibit transcriptional plasticity and a shared response to interferon in SIV-infected rhesus macaques.,J Leukoc Biol, 2018 Jan,29345061,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29345061/,The progression to AIDS is influenced by changes in the biology of heterogeneous monocyte subsets. Classical (CD14++CD16-)， intermediate (CD14++CD16+)， and nonclassical (CD14+CD16++) monocytes may represent progressive stages of monocyte maturation or disparate myeloid lineages with different turnover rates and function. To investigate the relationship between monocyte subsets and the response to SIV infection， we performed microarray analysis of monocyte subsets in rhesus macaques at three time points: prior to SIV infection， 26 days postinfection， and necropsy with AIDS. Genes with a 2-fold change between monocyte subsets (2023 genes) or infection time points (424 genes) were selected. We identify 172 genes differentially expressed among monocyte subsets in both uninfected and SIV-infected animals. Classical monocytes express genes associated with inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Nonclassical monocytes express genes associated with activation， immune effector functions， and cell cycle inhibition. The classical and intermediate subsets are most similar at all time points， and transcriptional similarity between intermediate and nonclassical monocytes increases with AIDS. Cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids， restriction factors， and IFN-stimulated genes are induced in all three subsets with AIDS. We conclude that SIV infection alters the transcriptional relationship between monocyte subsets and that the innate immune response to SIV infection is conserved across monocyte subsets.Keywords:AIDS; CD14; CD16; HIV; immune activation; pathogenesis.
Gene expression variations in microsatellite stable and unstable colon cancer cells.,J Surg Res, 2012 May 1,21816436,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21816436/,Background:Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a marker of chemoresistance， but it is associated with improved survival compared with microsatellite-stable (MSS) colon cancers. We hypothesized that MSI tumors overexpress chemoresistance-associated genes and underexpress DNA damage/repair genes. We used ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to assess the expression of representative genes in MSI and MSS colon cancer cell lines.Methods:Solexa UHTS was used to examine gene expression in HCT116 (MSI) and HT29 (MSS) cells， and normal colonic mucosa (NCM). We compared expression of 40 genes involved in chemoresistance， DNA repair， DNA damage， and drug metabolism pathways.Results:We observed gene expression differences between MSI and MSS cell lines in 8 out of 40 genes involved in mismatch repair (MMR)， DNA repair， drug metabolism， and chemoresistance. MMR gene expression was lower in MSI cells， which is consistent with the MSI phenotype， whereas DNA repair genes were highly expressed in these cells. Genes associated with chemoresistance and drug metabolism also had increased expression in MSI cells. No difference in expression of DNA damage genes was observed between MSI and MSS cell lines.Conclusion:Using UHTS gene expression analysis， we identified differential expression of genes between MSI and MSS cell lines which may account for resistance to chemotherapy in MSI tumors. UHTS expression analysis has the potential to identify genome-wide predictors of response or resistance to chemotherapy.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.govNCT00335816.
Comparative analysis of iPSC-derived NK cells from two differentiation strategies reveals distinct signatures and cytotoxic activities.,Front Immunol, 2024 Oct 9,39445004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39445004/,"Purpose:The ability to generate natural killer (NK) cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has given rise to new possibilities for the large-scale production of homogeneous immunotherapeutic cellular products and opened new avenues towards the creation of ""off-the-shelf"" cancer immunotherapies. However， the differentiation of NK cells from iPSCs remains poorly understood， particularly regarding the ontogenic landscape of iPSC-derived NK (iNK) cells producedin vitroand the influence that the differentiation strategy employed may have on the iNK profile.Methods:To investigate this question， we conducted a comparative analysis of two sets of iNK cells generated from the same iPSC line using two different protocols: (i) a short-term， clinically compatible feeder-free protocol corresponding to primitive hematopoiesis， and (ii) a lymphoid-based protocol representing the definitive hematopoietic step.Results and discussion:Our work demonstrated that both protocols are capable of producing functional iNK cells. However， the two sets of resulting iNKs exhibited distinct phenotypes and transcriptomic profiles. The lymphoid-based differentiation approach generated iNKs with a more mature and activated profile， which demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines compared to iNK cells produced under short-term feeder-free conditions suggesting that the differentiation strategy must be considered when designing iNK cell-based adoptive immunotherapies.Keywords:feeder-free differentiation; immunotherapy; induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC); lymphoid-based differentiation; natural killer (NK)."
Molecular changes associated with the agonist activity of hydroxy-tamoxifen and the hyper-response to estradiol in hydroxy-tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines.,Endocr Relat Cancer, 2005 Mar,15788640,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15788640/,The aim of this study was to explore the pharmacological response to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OH-Tam) and to estradiol (E2) in three cell lines: MVLN， a human breast carcinoma cell line derived from MCF-7， and two MVLN-derived OH-Tam-resistant (OTR) cell lines， called CL6.8 and CL6.32. The OH-Tam response in the OTR cells was associated with the development of both an agonist activity of the drug on cell proliferation and the resistance of the cells to OH-Tam-induced apoptosis. The OTR cells also developed an increased sensitivity to the E2 growth-stimulating activity. To delineate the genes that determine such responses， we combined a mini-array-based gene-selection approach and an extensive real-time quantitative PCR exploration in the MVLN and OTR cell lines exposed to three pharmacological conditions: a 4-day treatment with E2， OH-Tam or both E2 and OH-Tam. Compiled data revealed a hyper-response to E2 and a modification of the OH-Tam pharmacological response (loss of antagonist action and agonist activity) at the gene-expression level. The proteins encoded by the genes selected in this study have been reported to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation， cell transformation， DNA repair and apoptosis， or belong to the ErbB/epidermal growth factor receptor-driven pathway. Our data also provide evidence of changes in transcriptional co-regulator expression， elevated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and increase in the phosphorylation status of estrogen receptor alpha on serine residue 118 in the OTR cell lines， suggesting the possible involvement of such mechanisms in the agonist activity of OH-Tam and/or the hyper-response of cells to E2. Taken together， our study should enhance our knowledge of the multifactorial events associated with the development of Tam resistance in two independent cell lines issued from the same selection process and should help in the identification of potential molecular targets for diagnosis or therapy.
Sequential use of protein kinase inhibitors potentiates their toxicity to melanoma cells: a rationale to combine targeted drugs based on protein expression inhibition profiles.,Int J Oncol, 2013 Sep,23835698,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23835698/,Targeted therapy has shown high efficacy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with impressive response rates. However， resistance appears after a few months， underlining the need for simultaneous multiple signalling pathway inhibition to provide a durable benefit. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible synergistic effect of various protein kinase inhibitor combinations targeting SRC， MEK， PI3K or JAK on the survival of representative melanoma cell lines with WTNRAS/WTBRAF and harbouring the most frequent mutations (Q61LNRAS/WTBRAF or WTNRAS/V600EBRAF). By comparing IC50s and protein inhibition profiles， cell exposure to a single inhibitor for 3 days (condition 1) showed that both WTBRAF lines were at least 15-fold more sensitive to SRC inhibition while V600EBRAF cells were 30-fold more sensitive to MEK inhibition， confirming that the latter cells are largely dependent on the MAPK pathway for growth. Concomitant treatment for 3 days (condition 2) revealed an antagonistic effect between SRC and JAK inhibitors as compared to treatment by each inhibitor alone in all 3 lines， supporting that both SRC and JAK stimulate the STAT pathway. Finally， sequential cell exposure to inhibitors by pre-treatment with a single effector at non-toxic but effective on target inhibition concentrations for 7 days followed by the addition of each of the other inhibitors for 3 days (condition 3) showed that MEK， PI3K or JAK inhibitor acted in synergy with the SRC inhibitor in both wild-type and Q61LNRAS cells， suggesting that the first inhibitor could activate the SRC/STAT compensatory signalling pathway. In conclusion， a treatment strategy consisting in a sequential use of targeted inhibitors to first render melanoma cells more dependent on alternative compensatory pathways that should subsequently be inhibited， may enhance efficacy. By contrast， concomitant exposure to various combinations of inhibitors at different concentrations failed to produce such effect， further supporting the importance of both the duration of cell exposure to inhibitors and their sequential use.

Induction of apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells by green tea catechins.,Biomed Res, 2009 Aug,19729851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19729851/,Cell culture and animal studies have demonstrated strong chemopreventative effects of green tea and its associated polyphenols in multiple cancers， though the exact mechanisms of action are not well understood. This in vitro study examined the antiproliferative/pro-apoptotic potential of green tea extract (GTE)， polyphenon-60 (PP-60)， (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in both normal and malignant human bladder cells. Cell growth (proliferation/apoptosis) was measured in UROtsa (normal)， SW780 (tumorigenic; low-grade)， and TCCSUP (tumorigenic; high-grade) human bladder urothelial cells by cell proliferation (XTT) assay after treatment with 0-80 microg/mL of GTE， PP-60， ECG and EGCG for 72 h. Molecular signaling pathways of catechin-induced apoptosis were analyzed using Human signal transduction RT(2) Profiler PCR array (SuperArray). Compared to control-treated cells， treatment with catechin agents significantly suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.01)， with strongest effects evoked by ECG and EGCG in UROtsa cells， ECG in low-grade RT4 and SW780 cells， and PP-60 and EGCG in high-grade TCCSUP and T24 cells. Microarray analysis indicated distinct differences in mRNA gene expression regarding growth signaling pathway activation induced by EGCG in normal/tumorigenic human bladder cell lines， providing a rationale for the putative therapeutic usage of green tea polyphenols against bladder disease.

Fully automated expansion and activation of clinical-grade natural killer cells for adoptive immunotherapy.,Cytotherapy, 2015 May,25881519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25881519/,Background aims:Ex vivo expansion of natural killer (NK) cells is a strategy to produce large numbers of these effector cells for immunotherapy. However， the transfer of bench-top expansion protocols to clinically applicable methods is challenging for NK cell-based therapy because of regulatory aspects and scale-up issues. Therefore， we developed an automated， large-scale NK cell expansion process.Methods:Enriched NK cells were expanded with interleukin-2 and irradiated clinical-grade Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid feeder cells with the use of an automated system in comparison to manual expansion， and the cells were investigated for their functionality， phenotype and gene expression.Results:Automated expansion resulted in a mean 850-fold expansion of NK cells by day 14， yielding 1.3 (± 0.9) × 10(9) activated NK cells. Automatically and manually produced NK cells were comparable in target cell lysis， degranulation and production of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α and had similar high levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against rituximab-treated leukemic cells. NK cells after automated or manual expansion showed similar gene expression and marker profiles. However， expanded NK cells differed significantly from primary NK cells including upregulation of the functional relevant molecules TRAIL and FasL and NK cell-activating receptors NKp30， NKG2D and DNAM-1. Neither automatically nor manually expanded NK cells showed reduced telomere length indicative of a conserved proliferative potential.Conclusions:We established an automated method to expand high numbers of clinical-grade NK cells with properties similar to their manually produced counterparts. This automated process represents a highly efficient tool to standardize NK cell processing for therapeutic applications.Keywords:CliniMACS Prodigy; NK cell expansion; NK cell therapy; automation; immunotherapy; natural killer cells.
A microarray based expression profiling of paclitaxel and vincristine resistant MCF-7 cells.,Eur J Pharmacol, 2011 Apr 25,21320484,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21320484/,Resistance to the broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cell lines and tumors has been called multiple drug resistance (MDR). In this study， the molecular mechanisms of resistance to two anticancer agents (paclitaxel and vincristine) in mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7 were investigated. Drug resistant sublines to paclitaxel (MCF-7/Pac) and vincristine (MCF-7/Vinc) that were developed from sensitive MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/S) were used. cDNA microarray analysis was performed for the RNA samples of sensitive and resistant cells in duplicate experiments. GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 Software was used in data analysis. The results indicated that the upregulation of MDR1 gene is the dominating mechanism of the paclitaxel and vincristine drug resistance. Additionally the upregulation of the genes encoding the detoxifying enzymes (i.e. GSTP1) was observed. Significant downregulation of apoptotic genes (i.e. PDCD2/4/6/8) and upregulation of some cell cycle regulatory genes (CDKN2A， CCNA2 etc.) was seen which may be in close relation to MDR in breast cancer. Drug resistant cancer cells exhibit different gene expression patterns depending on drug treatment， and each drug resistance phenotype is probably genetically different. Further functional studies are needed to demonstrate the complete set of genes contributing to the drug resistance phenotype in breast cancer cells.
DNA microarray profiling of genes differentially regulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitors vorinostat and LBH589 in colon cancer cell lines.,BMC Med Genomics, 2009 Nov 30,19948057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19948057/,Background:Despite the significant progress made in colon cancer chemotherapy， advanced disease remains largely incurable and novel efficacious chemotherapies are urgently needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) represent a novel class of agents which have demonstrated promising preclinical activity and are undergoing clinical evaluation in colon cancer. The goal of this study was to identify genes in colon cancer cells that are differentially regulated by two clinically advanced hydroxamic acid HDACi， vorinostat and LBH589 to provide rationale for novel drug combination partners and identify a core set of HDACi-regulated genes.Methods:HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells were treated with LBH589 or vorinostat and growth inhibition， acetylation status and apoptosis were analyzed in response to treatment using MTS， Western blotting and flow cytometric analyses. In addition， gene expression was analyzed using the Illumina Human-6 V2 BeadChip array and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.Results:Treatment with either vorinostat or LBH589 rapidly induced histone acetylation， cell cycle arrest and inhibited the growth of both HCT116 and HT29 cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the microarray profiling revealed significant similarity in the genes altered in expression following treatment with the two HDACi tested within each cell line. However， analysis of genes that were altered in expression in the HCT116 and HT29 cells revealed cell-line-specific responses to HDACi treatment. In addition a core cassette of 11 genes modulated by both vorinostat and LBH589 were identified in both colon cancer cell lines analyzed.Conclusion:This study identified HDACi-induced alterations in critical genes involved in nucleotide metabolism， angiogenesis， mitosis and cell survival which may represent potential intervention points for novel therapeutic combinations in colon cancer. This information will assist in the identification of novel pathways and targets that are modulated by HDACi， providing much-needed information on HDACi mechanism of action and providing rationale for novel drug combination partners. We identified a core signature of 11 genes which were modulated by both vorinostat and LBH589 in a similar manner in both cell lines. These core genes will assist in the development and validation of a common gene set which may represent a molecular signature of HDAC inhibition in colon cancer.
Down-regulation of MSH2 expression by Hsp90 inhibition enhances cytotoxicity affected by tamoxifen in human lung cancer cells.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2015 Jan 2,25490383,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25490383/,The anti-estrogen tamoxifen has been used worldwide as an adjuvant hormone therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer. However， the molecular mechanism of tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells has not been identified. Human MutS homolog 2 (MSH2)， a crucial element of the highly conserved DNA mismatch repair system， and expression of MSH2 have been down-regulated by Hsp90 function inhibition in human lung cancer. Therefore， in this study， we examined whether MSH2 plays a role in the tamoxifen and Hsp90 inhibitor-induced cytotoxic effect on NSCLC cells. The results showed that treatment with tamoxifen increased MSH2 mRNA and protein levels. The combination treatment with PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 or wortmannin) or knockdown AKT expression by specific small interfering RNA could decrease tamoxifen-induced MSH2 expression. Both knocking down MSH2 expression and co-treatment of PI3K inhibitors enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of tamoxifen. Compared to a single agent alone， tamoxifen combined with an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition synergistically in NSCLC cells， accompanied with reduced MSH2 expression. These findings may have implications for the rational design of future drug regimens incorporating tamoxifen and Hsp90 inhibitors for the treatment of NSCLC.Keywords:AKT; Hsp90 inhibition; MSH2; Non-small cell lung cancer; Tamoxifen.
Selection of internal references for qRT-PCR assays of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.,Biosci Rep, 2017 Dec 22,29180379,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29180379/,Selecting internal references is important for normalizing the loading quantity of samples in quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). In the present study， a systematic evaluation of reference genes among nine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines was conducted. After screening the microarray assay data of ten HCC cell lines， 19 candidate reference genes were preselected and then evaluated by qRT-PCR， together withACTB， GAPDH， HPRT1andTUBBThe expression evenness of these candidate genes was evaluated using RefFinder. The stabilities of the reference genes were further evaluated under different experimental perturbations in Huh-7 and MHCC-97L， and the applicability of the reference genes was assessed by measuring the mRNA expression ofCCND1， CCND3， CDK4andCDK6under sorafenib treatment in Huh-7. Results showed thatTFGandSFRS4are among the most reliable reference genes， andACTBranks third and acts quite well as a classical choice， whereasGAPDH， HPRT1andTUBBare not proper reference genes in qRT-PCR assays among the HCC cell lines.SFRS4， YWHAB， SFRS4andCNPY3are the most stable reference genes of the MHCC-97L under the perturbations of chemotherapy， oxidative stress， starvation and hypoxia respectively， whereasYWHABis the most stable one of Huh-7 under all perturbations.GAPDHis recommended as a reference gene under chemotherapy perturbations.YWHABandUBE2B， TMED2andTSFM， andGAPDHandTSFMare the two best reference genes under oxidative stress， starvation and hypoxia perturbations respectively.TSFMis stable in both cell lines across all the perturbations.Keywords:ACTB; HCC; RefFinder; SFRS4; TFG; internal references; qRT-PCR.
Zinc(II) niflumato complex effects on MMP activity and gene expression in human endometrial cell lines.,Sci Rep, 2021 Sep 27,34580366,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34580366/,Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease which increasingly affects young women under 35 years of age and leads to subfertility even infertility. Analysis of the cytotoxic effect of zinc(II) niflumato complex with neocuproine ([Zn(neo)(nif)2] or Zn-Nif) on immortalized human endometriotic cell line (12Z) and on control immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line (hTERT) was performed using xCELLigence technology for approximately 72 h following the treatment with Zn-Nif as well as cell viability Trypan Blue Assay. 12Z cell line proliferated more slowly compared to unaffected cells， whereas hTERT cells did not show similar behavior after treatment. The complex probably reduces the effect of pro-inflammatory pathways due to the effect of NSAID， while presence of zinc might reduce the level of ROS and regulate ER2 levels and MMP activity. The observed effects and high selectivity for rapidly proliferating cells with increased inflammatory activity suggest a good prognosis of successful decrease of endometriosis stage with this complex.
Fractionated radiation therapy can induce a molecular profile for therapeutic targeting.,Radiat Res, 2010 Oct,20726711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20726711/,To examine the possibility of using fractionated radiation in a unique way with molecular targeted therapy， gene expression profiles of prostate carcinoma cells treated with 10 Gy radiation administered either as a single dose or as fractions of 2 Gy × 5 and 1 Gy × 10 were examined by microarray analysis. Compared to the single dose， the fractionated irradiation resulted in significant increases in differentially expressed genes in both cell lines， with more robust changes in PC3 cells than in DU145 cells. The differentially expressed genes (>twofold change; P < 0.05) were clustered and their ontological annotations evaluated. In PC3 cells genes regulating immune and stress response， cell cycle and apoptosis were significantly up-regulated by multifractionated radiation compared to single-dose radiation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the differentially expressed genes revealed that immune response and cardiovascular genes were in the top functional category in PC3 cells and cell-to-cell signaling in DU145 cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that a flexure point for gene expression occurred at the 6th-8th fraction and AKT inhibitor perifosine produced enhanced cell killing after 1 Gy × 8 fractionated radiation in PC3 and DU145 cells compared to single dose. This study suggests that fractionated radiation may be a uniquely exploitable， non-oncogene-addiction stress pathway for molecular therapeutic targeting.
Matrine reduces proliferation of human lung cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and changing miRNA expression profiles.,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2014,24716952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24716952/,Matrine， a main active component extracted from dry roots of Sophora flavecens ， has been reported to exert antitumor effects on A549 human non-small lung cancer cells， but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. To determine effects of matrine on proliferation of A549 cells and assess possible mechanisms， MTT assays were employed to detect cytotoxicity， along with o flow cytometric analysis of DNA content of nuclei of cells following staining with propidium iodide to analyze cell cycle distribution. Western blotting was performed to determined expression levels of Bax， Bcl-2， VEGF and HDAC1， while a microarray was used to assessed changes of miRNA profiles. In the MTT assay， matrine suppressed growth of human lung cancer cell A549 in a dose- and time- dependent manner at doses of 0.25-2.5 mg/ml for 24h， 48h or 72h. Matrine induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and decreased the G2/M phase， while down-regulating the expression of Bcl2 protein， leading to a reduction in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. In addition， matrine down regulated the expression level of VEGF and HDAC1 of A549 cells. Microarray analysis demonstrated that matrine altered the expression level of miRNAs compared with untreated control A549 cells. In conclusion， matrine could inhibit proliferation of A549 cells， providing useful information for understanding anticancer mechanisms.
Modulation of the anti-cancer efficacy of microtubule-targeting agents by cellular growth conditions.,Cancer Biol Ther, 2010 May 15,20234172,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20234172/,Mitotic spindle-disrupting agents target and disrupt microtubule dynamics. These agents include clinically important chemotherapies， including taxanes (paclitaxel (Taxol)， docetaxel (Taxotere)) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine (Oncovin)， vinblastine). Taxanes are a standard component of treatment for many malignancies， often in conjunction with other cytotoxic agents. However， the optimal sequencing of these treatments and whether efficacy may be influenced by in vitro cellular growth conditions remain incompletely investigated. Yet such preclinical investigations may guide clinical decision making. We therefore studied the effect of cell density on rapid killing by paclitaxel and vincristine. Breast， ovarian and prostate cancer cells were sensitive to rapid killing by either agent when grown at low density， but were markedly resistant when grown at high density， i.e. nearly confluent. The resistance of densely growing cells to rapid killing by these drugs translated to increased clonogenic survival. Pretreatment of densely growing cancer cells with cisplatin followed by paclitaxel， partially reversed the treatment resistance. Gene ontology associations from microarray analyses of cells grown at low and high density， suggested roles for membrane signal transduction and adhesion， but potentially also DNA damage repair and metabolism. Taken together， the treatment resistance at higher cell density may be associated with a lower proportion of active cycling in cells growing at high density as well as transduction of survival signals induced by increased cell-cell adhesion. Collectively these findings suggest mechanisms by which growth conditions may contribute to resistance to rapid killing by microtubule-disrupting drugs.
Transcriptomic Analysis of Colorectal Cancer Cells Treated with Oil Production Waste Products (OPWPs) Reveals Enrichment of Pathways of Mitochondrial Functionality.,Cells, 2022 Dec 10,36552757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36552757/,Oil production waste products (OPWPs) derive from olive mill and represent a crucial environmental problem due to their high polyphenolic content able to pollute the ground. One option to reduce the OPWPs' environmental impact is to exploit polyphenols' biological properties. We sought to analyze the transcriptomic variations of colorectal cancer cells exposed to the OPWPs extracts and hydroxytyrosol， the major component， to recognize unknown and ill-defined characteristics. Among the top affected pathways identified by GSEA， we focused on oxidative phosphorylation in an in vitro system. Colorectal cancer HCT116 and LoVo cells treated with hydroxytyrosol or OPWPs extracts showed enhancement of the respiratory chain complexes' protein levels， ATP production and membrane potential， suggesting stimulation of mitochondrial functions. The major proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion events of mitochondrial dynamics were positively affected， as by Western blot， fostering increase of the mitochondrial mass organized in a network of elongated organelles. Mechanistically， we proved that PPARγ mediates the effects as they are mimicked by a specific ligand and impaired by a specific inhibitor. OPWP extracts and hydroxytyrosol， thus， promote mitochondrial functionality via a feed-forward regulatory loop involving the PPARγ/PGC-1α axis. These results support their use in functional foods and as adjuvants in cancer therapy.Keywords:PGC-1α; PPARγ; colorectal cancer; hydroxytyrosol; mitochondrial biogenesis; mitochondrial dynamics; oil production waste products (OPWPs); polyphenols.
Selective inhibition of esophageal cancer cells by combination of HDAC inhibitors and Azacytidine.,Epigenetics, 2015,25923331,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25923331/,Esophageal cancers are highly aggressive tumors with poor prognosis despite some recent advances in surgical and radiochemotherapy treatment options. This study addressed the feasibility of drugs targeting epigenetic modifiers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells. We tested inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by SAHA， MS-275， and FK228， inhibition of DNA methyltransferases by Azacytidine (AZA) and Decitabine (DAC)， and the effect of combination treatment using both types of drugs. The drug targets， HDAC1/2/3 and DNMT1， were expressed in normal esophageal epithelium and tumor cells of ESCC or EAC tissue specimens， as well as in non-neoplastic esophageal epithelial (Het-1A)， ESCC (OE21， Kyse-270， Kyse-410)， and EAC (OE33， SK-GT-4) cell lines. In vitro， HDAC activity， histone acetylation， and p21 expression were similarly affected in non-neoplastic， ESCC， and EAC cell lines post inhibitor treatment. Combined MS-275/AZA treatment， however， selectively targeted esophageal cancer cell lines by inducing DNA damage， cell viability loss， and apoptosis， and by decreasing cell migration. Non-neoplastic Het-1A cells were protected against HDACi (MS-275)/AZA treatment. RNA transcriptome analyses post MS-275 and/or AZA treatment identified novel regulated candidate genes (up: BCL6， Hes2; down: FAIM， MLKL)， which were specifically associated with the treatment responses of esophageal cancer cells. In summary， combined HDACi/AZA treatment is efficient and selective for the targeting of esophageal cancer cells， despite similar target expression of normal and esophageal cancer epithelium， in vitro and in human esophageal carcinomas. The precise mechanisms of action of treatment responses involve novel candidate genes regulated by HDACi/AZA in esophageal cancer cells. Together， targeting of epigenetic modifiers in esophageal cancers may represent a potential future therapeutic approach.Keywords:5mC， 5-methylcytidine; AZA， Azacytidine; DAC， Decitabine; DNMT， DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase; EAC， esophageal adenocarcinoma; ESCC， esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; FAIM， Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule; GEJ， gastro-esophageal junction; H3Ac， histone H3 acetylation; H3K4me3， histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4; H3K9Ac， histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation; HDAC， histone deacetylases; HDACi， HDAC inhibitor; Hes-2， Hairy and enhancer of split 2; SAHA， suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; TSA， Trichostatin A; azacytidine/gene pathway regulation; epigenetics/HDAC inhibitor; esophageal cancer.
Expression pattern， regulation， and clinical significance of TOX in breast cancer.,Cancer Immunol Immunother, 2021 Feb,32757053,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32757053/,Thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein (TOX) is a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of T cell exhaustion during chronic infection and cancer. While TOX is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy， limited information is available about its significance in breast cancer and other solid tumors. We performed a comprehensive analysis of TOX gene expression， its epigenetic regulation， protein localization， relation to tumor infiltrating immune cell composition， and prognostic significance in breast cancer using publicly available datasets. Our results suggest an inverse correlation between TOX expression and DNA methylation in tumor cells. However， its expression is elevated in tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs)， which may compensates for the total TOX levels in the tumor as a whole. Furthermore， higher TOX levels in tumors are associated with T cell exhaustion signatures along with presence of active inflammatory response， including elevated levels of T cell effector cytokines. Survival analysis also confirmed that higher expression of TOX is associated with better prognosis in breast cancer. Therefore， expression of TOX may serve as a novel prognostic marker for this malignancy.Keywords:Breast cancer; Cancer immunotherapy; Immune checkpoint proteins; PD-1; T cell exhaustion; TOX.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators: discrimination of agonistic versus antagonistic activities by gene expression profiling in breast cancer cells.,Cancer Res, 2004 Feb 15,14973112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14973112/,Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen are effective in the treatment of many estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers and have also proven to be effective in the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease. The comparative abilities of tamoxifen versus raloxifene in breast cancer prevention are currently being compared in the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene trial. To better understand the actions of these compounds in breast cancer， we have examined their effects on the expression of approximately 12，000 genes， using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays， with quantitative PCR verification in many cases， categorizing their actions as agonist， antagonist， or partial agonist/antagonist. Analysis of gene stimulation and inhibition by the SERMs trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) and raloxifene (Ral) or ICI 182，780 (ICI) and by estradiol (E2) in estrogen receptor-containing MCF-7 human breast cancer cells revealed that (a) TOT was the most E2-like of the three compounds， (b) all three compounds either partially or fully antagonized the action of E2 on most genes， with the order of antagonist activity being ICI > Ral > TOT， (c) TOT and Ral， but not ICI， displayed partial agonist/partial antagonist activity on a number of E2-regulated genes， (d) several stimulatory cell cycle-related genes were down-regulated exclusively by ICI， (e) the estrogen-like activity of Ral nearly always overlapped with that of TOT， indicating that Ral has little unique agonist activity different from that of TOT， and (f) some genes were specifically up-regulated by TOT but not Ral， ICI， or E2. Hence， gene expression profiling can discern fundamental differences among SERMs and provides insight into the distinct biologies of TOT， Ral， and ICI in breast cancer.
Predicting drug sensitivity and resistance: profiling ABC transporter genes in cancer cells.,Cancer Cell, 2004 Aug,15324696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15324696/,For analysis of multidrug resistance， a major barrier to effective cancer chemotherapy， we profiled mRNA expression of the 48 known human ABC transporters in 60 diverse cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) used by the National Cancer Institute to screen for anticancer activity. The use of real-time RT-PCR avoided artifacts commonly encountered with microarray technologies. By correlating the results with the growth inhibitory profiles of 1，429 candidate anticancer drugs tested against the cells， we identified which transporters are more likely than others to confer resistance to which agents. Unexpectedly， we also found and validated compounds whose activity is potentiated， rather than antagonized， by the MDR1 multidrug transporter. Such compounds may serve as leads for development.
EGF-mediated reduced miR-92a-1-5p controls HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion through activation of MAPK8 and FAS which in turn increase MMP-2/-9 expression.,Sci Rep, 2020 Jul 23,32703964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32703964/,The members of human miR-17-92 cluster are implicated in several cancers and are known to increase cancer cells invasiveness. The present study reports reduced expression of miR-92a-1-5p in EGF treated HTR-8/SVneo trophoblastic cells by NGS and qRT-PCR. Overexpression of miR-92a-1-5p led to significantly reduced EGF-mediated HTR-8/SVneo cells invasion. MAPK8 and FAS were predicted to be miR-92a-1-5p targets， and confirmed to be reduced by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in trophoblast cells overexpressing miR-92a-1-5p. The binding of miR-92a-1-5p to MAPK8 and FAS 3'-UTR was confirmed by Luciferase reporter assay and Rescue assay. EGF increases MMP-2 & MMP-9 expression and reduces TIMP1 expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Inhibition of MAPK8 (by SP600125) reduced EGF-mediated MMP-9/TIMP1 ratio and invasion. Similarly， silencing of FAS by siRNA reduced EGF-mediated MMP-2/TIMP1 ratio and invasion. Treatment of HTR-8/SVneo cells with STAT1/3 inhibitors or siRNAs led to loss of EGF-mediated reduction in miR-92a-1-5p levels. Inserting the predicted binding sites of STAT3 present in promoter region of miR-92a-1-5p upstream of Luciferase promoter reduced its expression in presence of STAT3 expression vector. Thus， EGF leads to reduced miR-92a-1-5p expression which may be regulated by STAT1/STAT3 and controls HTR-8/SVneo cells invasion by targeting MAPK8 and FAS， which in turn increases MMP-2/MMP-9 expression.

Effects of combined treatments with CTLA4-IG (abatacept)， dexamethasone and methotrexate on cultured human macrophages.,Clin Exp Rheumatol, 2016 May-Jun,26940199,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26940199/,Objectives:To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) and dexamethasone (DEX) monotreatment versus their combination and adding methotrexate (MTX) on cultured human macrophages.Methods:THP-1 cells， activated into macrophages (PMA 0.05 μg/ml)， were cultured for 3 and 24 hrs with CTLA4-Ig (500 μg/ml)， DEX (10-8 M)， MTX (0.05 μg/ml)， and CTLA4-Ig combined with DEX or CTLA4-Ig combined with DEX plus MTX. CTLA4-Ig/CD86 interaction was evaluated by FACS analysis. Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR)， immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunoassay (ELISA) analysis for inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β， TNF-α， IL-6) expression were performed.Results:FACS analysis showed in macrophages treated with CTLA4-Ig alone， CTLA4-Ig-DEX and CTLA4-Ig-DEX-MTX a CD86 decrease of almost 35%， versus untreated cells (CNT). After 3 hrs， macrophages treated with DEX alone or with CTLA4-Ig-DEX or CTLA4-Ig-DEX-MTX showed a significant reduction (p<0.05) for all cytokines gene expression， that was still significant for IL-1β after 24 hrs (p<0.05). After 3 hrs， CTLA4-Ig alone significantly (p<0.05) reduced all cytokine genes; however， after 24 hrs still evident only for TNF-α (p<0.05). After 24 hrs CTLA4-Ig-DEX induced a significant decrease of gene expression (p<0.05) for TNF-α and IL-6， whereas CTLA4-Ig-DEX-MTX induced a decrease (p<0.05) limited to IL-6， versus CNT. Finally， ICC showed， after 24 hrs of CTLA4-Ig-DEX or CTLA4-Ig-DEX-MTX treatment a reduction (p<0.05) of IL-1β and IL-6 expression， versus CNT; DEX alone reduced only IL-1β (p<0.05). ELISA analysis confirmed these results.Conclusions:CTLA4-Ig-DEX and CTLA4-Ig-DEX-MTX combined treatments， decreased at any level the inflammatory cytokine expression more efficiently then monotreatments on activated cultured human macrophages.
Transcriptome analysis and connectivity mapping of Cissampelos pareira L. provides molecular links of ESR1 modulation to viral inhibition.,Sci Rep, 2021 Oct 11,34635729,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34635729/,Bioactive fractions obtained from medicinal plants which have been used for the treatment of multiple diseases could exert their effects by targeting common pathways. Prior knowledge of their usage could allow us to identify novel molecular links. In this study， we explored the molecular basis of action of one such herbal formulation Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa)， used for the treatment of female hormone disorders and fever. Transcriptomic studies on MCF7 cell lines treated with Cipa extract carried out using Affymetrix arrays revealed a downregulation of signatures of estrogen response potentially modulated through estrogen receptor α (ERα). Molecular docking analysis identified 38 Cipa constituents that potentially bind (ΔG < - 7.5) with ERα at the same site as estrogen. The expression signatures in the connectivity map ( https://clue.io/; ) revealed high positive scores with translation inhibitors such as emetine (score: 99.61) and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response such as ribosomal protein RPL7 (score: 99.92)， which is a reported ERα coactivator. Further， gene knockdown experiments revealed that Cipa exhibits antiviral activity in dengue infected MCF7 cells potentially modulated through estrogen receptor 1. This approach reveals a novel pathway involving the ESR1-RPL7 axis which could be a potential target in dengue viral infection.
Gene expression profiles in the cellular response to a multinuclear platinum complex.,Cell Mol Life Sci, 2004 Apr,15095017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15095017/,We used cDNA arrays to monitor modulation of mRNA expression after exposure to a multinuclear platinum complex (BBR3464) in a human cervix squamous cell carcinoma cell line (A431) and in a cisplatin-resistant subline (A431/Pt) exhibiting collateral sensitivity to BBR3464. In parental A431cells， the drug induced at least twofold up-regulation of 15 genes including cell cycle and growth regulators， tumor suppressors and signal transduction genes. In cisplatin-resistant A431/Pt cells， BBR3464increased the expression of 15 genes such as apoptosis regulators and genes involved in the DNA damage response. Interestingly， BBR3464induced up-regulation of anti-metastatic factors together with down-regulation of several pro-metastatic factors. Cell cycle analysis indicated a marked G2arrest in treated A431cells， whereas an apoptotic response was documented in A431/Pt cells. These differential patterns of transcriptional profile in sensitive and resistant cells are consistent with a role for cell cycle regulation in the response to BBR3464.
Growth inhibition and transcriptional effects of ribavirin in lymphoma.,Oncol Rep, 2019 Sep,31322273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31322273/,Ribavirin exhibits inhibitory effects on the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)， which participates in lymphomagenesis. Additionally， preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the anti‑lymphoma activity of this drug. To further investigate the potential of ribavirin as an anticancer treatment for lymphoma， the tumor‑suppressive effects of ribavirin were analyzed in lymphoma cell lines. The effects of ribavirin on the viability and clonogenicity of the B‑cell lymphoma cell line Pfeiffer (EZH2‑mutant)， Toledo (EZH2 wild‑type) and cutaneous T‑cell lymphoma Hut78 cell line were assessed. Expression of EZH2 and trimethylation status of histone 3， lysine 27 trimethylated (H3K27m3) was also determined in response to ribavirin. The transcriptional effects of ribavirin on Hut78 cells were analyzed by microarray expression and the results were validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction， western blotting and knockout of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). The results of the present study demonstrated that ribavirin suppressed the growth and clonogenicity of cells in a dose‑dependent manner. Ribavirin did not affect the expression of EZH2 nor altered its activity as evaluated by H3K27 trimethylation status. Furthermore， the results of transcriptome analysis indicated that the majority of the canonical pathways affected by ribavirin were associated with the immune system， including 'antigen presentation'， 'communication between innate and adaptive immune cells' and 'cross‑talk between dendritic and natural killer cells'. The results of gene expression analysis were confirmed， by demonstrating at the RNA and protein levels， downregulation of stearoyl‑CoA desaturase and upregulation of STAT1. Depletion of STAT1， which was proposed as a key regulator of the aforementioned pathways， exerted growth inhibitory effects almost to the same extent as ribavirin. In conclusion， ribavirin was proposed to exert growth inhibitory effects on lymphoma cell lines， particularly Hut78 cells， a cutaneous T‑cell lymphoma cell line. Of note， these effects may depend on， at least in part， the activation of canonical immune pathways regulated by the key factors STAT1 and interferon‑γ. Our results provide insight into the anti‑lymphoma potential of ribavirin; however， further investigations in preclinical and clinical studies are required to determine the effectiveness of ribavirin as a therapeutic agent for treating lymphoma.
An injectable cellulose-based hydrogel for the transfer of autologous nasal chondrocytes in articular cartilage defects.,Biotechnol Bioeng, 2009 Mar 1,18949749,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18949749/,icular cartilage has a low capacity for spontaneous repair. To promote the repair of this tissue， the transfer of autologous chondrocytes using a three-dimensional matrix appears promising. In this context， the aim of the present work was to investigate the potential use of autologous rabbit nasal chondrocytes (RNC) associated with an injectable self-setting cellulose-based hydrogel (Si-HPMC). Firstly， the influence of Si-HPMC on chondrocytic phenotype was investigated by real-time PCR for specific chondrocyte markers (type II collagen and aggrecan) and type I collagen. Thereafter， autologous RNC were amplified in vitro for 4 weeks before transplantation with Si-HPMC into a rabbit articular cartilage defect followed by analysis 6 weeks later. Implants were histologically characterized for the presence of sulfated GAG and type II collagen. Transcripts analysis indicated that dedifferentiated RNC recovered expression of the main chondrocytic markers after in vitro three-dimensional culture within Si-HPMC. Histological analysis of autologous RNC transplanted in an articular cartilage defect revealed the formation of repair tissue with a histological organization similar to that of healthy articular cartilage. In addition， immunohistological analysis of type II collagen suggested that the repair tissue was a hyaline-like cartilage. Si-HPMC hydrogel associated with nasal chondrocytes therefore appears a promising injectable tissue engineering device for the repair of articular cartilage.
Exosomes play an important role in the process of psoralen reverse multidrug resistance of breast cancer.,J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 2016 Dec 1,27906043,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27906043/,Background:Release of exosomes have been shown to play critical roles in drug resistance by delivering cargo. Targeting the transfer of exosomes from resistant cells to sensitive cells may be an approach to overcome some cases of drug resistance.Method:In this study， we investigated the potential role of exosomes in the process of psoralen reverse multidrug resistance of MCF-7/ADR cells. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation of culture media from MCF-7/ADR cells (ADR/exo) and MCF-7 parental cells (S/exo). Exosomes were characterized by morphology， exosomal markers and size distribution. The ability of ADR/exo to transfer multidrug resistance was assessed by MTT and real-time quantitative PCR. The different formation and secretion of exosomes were detected by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Then we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Seq technology and real-time quantitative PCR to better understand the gene expression regulation in exosmes formation and release after psoralen treatment.Results:Our data showed that exosomes derived from MCF-7/ADR cells were able to promote active sequestration of drugs and could induce a drug resistance phenotype by transferring drug-resistance-related gene MDR-1 and P-glycoprotein protein. Psoralen could reduce the formation and secretion of exosomes to overcome drug resistance. There were 21 differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the most significantly expressed genes were linked to PPAR and P53 signaling pathways which were related to exosomes formation， secretion and cargo sorting.Conclusions:Psoralen can affect the exosomes and induce the reduction of resistance transmission via exosomes might through PPAR and P53 signaling pathways， which might provide a novel strategy for breast cancer resistance to chemotherapy in the future.Keywords:Breast cancer; Chemoresistance; Exosome; Psoralen.
Cytokine expression profiling in human leukocytes after exposure to hypertonic and isotonic fluids.,J Trauma, 2002 May,11988651,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11988651/,Background:Resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock causes profound immunologic changes. The tonicity of fluids used for resuscitation clearly influences the immune response. Our study was designed to determine whether isotonic and hypertonic fluids exert their differential effects on immune response by altering the cytokine gene profile of human leukocytes. The cDNA array method was used to profile transcriptional responses after exposure to hypertonic and isotonic fluids.Methods:Blood from seven healthy volunteers was incubated for 30 minutes with isotonic (10% dextran-40 and lactated Ringer's [LR] solution) and hypertonic (7.5% hypertonic saline and hypertonic dextran [HTD]) fluids. The volumes of isotonic fluids used were equal to the volume of blood， whereas the volumes of hypertonic fluids were adjusted to keep the salt load identical to the LR group. The cDNA array technique was used to measure the gene expression of 23 common cytokines.Results:Increased gene transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1alpha， IL-6， IL-10， and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) as well as others (IL-5， IL-7， and IL-16) was found after incubation with resuscitation fluids. Variances were noted depending on the type of fluid: HTD and LR solution did not induce expression of IL-5， and HTD also did not induce IL-1beta expression. Genes encoding IL-1alpha， IL-6， IL-9， and tumor necrosis factor-alpha had low level baseline expression in leukocytes isolated from unstimulated blood， and their expression increased markedly after exposure to resuscitation fluids. The inducible transcripts included IL-1beta， IL-7， IL-10， and IL-16. However， there was no difference in cytokine expression profile between isotonic and hypertonic fluids.Conclusion:Exposure of human leukocytes to resuscitation fluids causes an increase in cytokine gene expressions compared with undiluted blood. This expression profile is largely independent of the type of fluid used.
Immunomodulatory nanoparticles as adjuvants and allergen-delivery system to human dendritic cells: Implications for specific immunotherapy.,Vaccine, 2010 Jul 12,20478343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20478343/,Novel adjuvants and antigen-delivery systems with immunomodulatory properties that shift the allergenic Th2 response towards a Th1 or regulatory T cell response are desired for allergen-specific immunotherapy. This study demonstrates that 200-nm sized biodegradable poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA) nanoparticles (NPs) are activators of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Gamma-PGA NPs are efficiently internalized by immature MoDCs and strongly stimulate production of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines as well as up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and immunomodulatory mediators involved in efficient T cell priming. Furthermore， MoDCs from allergic subjects stimulated in vitro with a mixture of gamma-PGA NPs and extract of grass pollen allergen Phleum pratense (Phl p) augment allergen-specific IL-10 production and proliferation of autologous CD4(+) memory T cells. Thus， gamma-PGA NPs are promising as sophisticated adjuvants and allergen-delivery systems in allergen-specific immunotherapy.
The MOC31PE immunotoxin reduces cell migration and induces gene expression and cell death in ovarian cancer cells.,J Ovarian Res, 2014 Feb 15,24528603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24528603/,Background:The standard treatment of ovarian cancer with chemotherapy often leads to drug resistance and relapse of the disease， and the need for development of novel therapy alternatives is obvious. The MOC31PE immunotoxin binds to the cell surface antigen EpCAM， which is expressed by the majority of epithelial cancers including ovarian carcinomas， and we studied the cytotoxic effects of MOC31PE in ovarian cancer cells.Methods:Investigation of the effects of MOC31PE treatment on protein synthesis， cell viability， proliferation and gene expression of the ovarian cancer cell lines B76 and HOC7.Results:MOC31PE treatment for 24 h caused a dose-dependent reduction of protein synthesis with ID50 values of less than 10 ng/ml， followed by reduced cell viability. In a gene expression array monitoring the expression of 84 key genes in cancer pathways， 13 of the genes were differentially expressed by MOC31PE treatment in comparison to untreated cells. By combining MOC31PE and the immune suppressor cyclosporin A (CsA) the MOC31PE effect on protein synthesis inhibition and cell viability increased tenfold. Cell migration was also reduced， both in the individual MOC31PE and CsA treatment， but even more when combining MOC31PE and CsA. In tumor metastasis PCR arrays， 23 of 84 genes were differentially expressed comparing CsA versus MOC31PE + CsA treatment. Increased expression of the tumor suppressor KISS1 and the nuclear receptor NR4A3 was observed， and the differential candidate gene expression was confirmed in complementary qPCR analyses. For NR4A3 this was not accompanied by increased protein expression. However， a subcellular fractionation assay revealed increased mitochondrial NR4A3 in MOC31PE treated cells， suggesting a role for this protein in MOC31PE-induced apoptotic cell death.Conclusion:The present study demonstrates that MOC31PE may become a new targeted therapy for ovarian cancer and that the MOC31PE anti-cancer effect is potentiated by CsA.
Triple Isozyme Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase Inhibition in Fully Viable MDA-MB-231 Cells Induces Cytostatic Effects That Are Not Reversed by Exogenous Lactic Acid.,Biomolecules, 2021 Nov 24,34944395,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34944395/, number of aggressive human malignant tumors are characterized by an intensified glycolytic rate， over-expression of lactic acid dehydrogenase A (LDHA)， and subsequent lactate accumulation， all of which contribute toward an acidic peri-cellular immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While recent focus has been directed at how to inhibit LDHA， it is now becoming clear that multiple isozymes of LDH must be simultaneously inhibited in order to fully suppress lactic acid and halt glycolysis. In this work we explore the biochemical and genomic consequences of an applied triple LDH isozyme inhibitor (A， B， and C) (GNE-140) in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) cells. The findings confirm that GNE-140 does in fact， fully block the production of lactic acid， which also results in a block of glucose utilization and severe impedance of the glycolytic pathway. Without a fully functional glycolytic pathway， breast cancer cells continue to thrive， sustain viability， produce ample energy， and maintain mitochondrial potential (ΔΨM). The only observable negative consequence of GNE-140 in this work， was the attenuation of cell division， evident in both 2D and 3D cultures and occurring in fully viable cells. Of important note， the cytostatic effects were not reversed by the addition of exogenous (+) lactic acid. While the effects of GNE-140 on the whole transcriptome were mild (12 up-regulated differential expressed genes (DEGs); 77 down-regulated DEGs) out of the 48，226 evaluated， the down-regulated DEGS collectively centered around a loss of genes related to mitosis， cell cycle， GO/G1-G1/S transition， and DNA replication. These data were also observed with digital florescence cytometry and flow cytometry， both corroborating a G0/G1 phase blockage. In conclusion， the findings in this work suggest there is an unknown element linking LDH enzyme activity to cell cycle progression， and this factor is completely independent of lactic acid. The data also establish that complete inhibition of LDH in cancer cells is not a detriment to cell viability or basic production of energy.Keywords:LDH; cancer cells; glycolysis; inhibitor.

A systematic approach to therapeutic target selection in oesophago-gastric cancer.,Gut, 2013 Oct,22773546,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22773546/,Objective:The success of personalised therapy depends on identification and inhibition of the oncogene(s) on which that tumour is dependent. We aimed to determine whether a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array could be used to select the most effective therapeutic strategies in molecularly heterogeneous oesophago-gastric adenocarcinomas.Design:Gene expression profiling from oesophago-gastric tumours (n=75) and preinvasive stages (n=57) identified the active signalling pathways， which was confirmed using immunohistochemistry (n=434). RTK arrays on a cell line panel (n=14) determined therapeutic targets for in vitro cytotoxic testing. Feasibility of this personalised approach was tested in tumour samples (n=46).Results:MAPK was the most frequently activated pathway (32/75 samples (42.7%)) with progressive enrichment in preinvasive disease stages (p<0.05) and ERK phosphorylation in 148/434 (34.3%) independent samples. Cell lines displayed a range of RTK activation profiles. When no RTKs were activated， tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and a Mek inhibitor were not useful (MKN1). In lines with a dominant phosphorylated RTK (OE19， MKN45 and KATOIII)， selection of this TKI or Mek in nM concentrations induced cytotoxicity and inhibited Erk and Akt phosphorylation. In cells lines with complex activation profiles (HSC39 and OE33)， a combination of TKIs or Mek inhibition (in nM concentrations) was necessary for cytotoxicity and inhibition of Erk and Akt phosphorylation. Human tumours demonstrated diverse activation profiles and 65% of cases had two or more active RTKs.Conclusions:The MAPK pathway is commonly activated in oesophago-gastric cancer following activation of a variety of RTKs. Molecular phenotyping can inform a rational choice of targeted therapy.Keywords:Barrett's oesophagus; MAPK pathways; Oesophageal adenocarcinoma; adenocarcinoma; biostatistics; cancer genetics; cell signalling; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; oesophageal cancer; oncogene addiction; receptor tyrosine kinases; small molecular inhibitors.
SHOC2 scaffold protein modulates daunorubicin-induced cell death through p53 modulation in lymphoid leukemia cells.,Sci Rep, 2020 Sep 16,32938995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938995/,SHOC2 scaffold protein has been mainly related to oncogenic ERK signaling through the RAS-SHOC2-PP1 phosphatase complex. In leukemic cells however， SHOC2 upregulation has been previously related to an increased 5-year event-free survival of pediatric pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia， suggesting that SHOC2 could be a potential prognostic marker. To address such paradoxical function， our study investigated how SHOC2 impact leukemic cells drug response. Our transcriptome analysis has shown that SHOC2 can modulate the DNA-damage mediated by p53. Notably， upon genetic inhibition of SHOC2 we observed a significant impairment of p53 expression， which in turn， leads to the blockage of key apoptotic molecules. To confirm the specificity of DNA-damage related modulation， several anti-leukemic drugs has been tested and we did confirm that the proposed mechanism impairs cell death upon daunorubicin-induced DNA damage of human lymphoid cells. In conclusion， our study uncovers new insights into SHOC2 function and reveals that this scaffold protein may be essential to activate a novel mechanism of p53-induced cell death in pre-B lymphoid cells.

Toxicogenomics of kojic acid on gene expression profiling of a375 human malignant melanoma cells.,Biol Pharm Bull, 2006 Apr,16595896,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16595896/,Kojic acid is a natural product and normally used as a food additive and preservative， a skin-whitening agent in cosmetics， a plant growth regulator and a chemical intermediate. Using DNA microarray technology， the overall biological effects of kojic acid on the gene expression profiling of a human skin A375 malignant melanoma cells were examined. After treatment with kojic acid， a total of 361 differentially expressed genes were distinctively changed with 136 up-regulated genes and 225 down-regulated genes. We used the bioinformatics tool to search the gene ontology and category classification of differentially expressed genes that provided the useful information of expressed genes belonging to cellular component， molecular function and biological process in regulation of melanogenesis. Seven down-regulated genes of APOBEC1， ARHGEF16， CD22， FGFR3， GALNT1， UNC5C and ZNF146 that were typically validated by the real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis technology showed to be the tumor suppressor genes in melanoma cancer cells. Thus， microarray technology coupled with RT-qPCR offered a high throughput method to explore the number of differentially expressed genes responding to kojic acid and their biological functions， and led to more understanding of kojic acid effects on skin cancer therapy and related side effects. Moreover， the differentially expressed genes may become useful markers of skin malignant melanoma for further diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Expression profiling of nucleotide metabolism-related genes in human breast cancer cells after treatment with 5-fluorouracil.,Cancer Invest, 2009 Jun,19219653,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19219653/,5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most widely used drugs for treatment of cancers， including breast cancer that exhibits its anticancer activity by inhibiting DNA synthesis and also incorporated into DNA and RNA. The objective of this investigation was to find out the total nucleotide metabolism genes regulated by 5-FU in breast cancer cell line. The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was treated with the drug 5-FU. To analyze the expression of genes， we have conducted the experiment using 1.7 k and 19k human microarray slide and confirmed the expression of genes by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The expression of 44 genes involved in the nucleotide metabolism pathway was quantified. Of these 44 genes analyzed， transcription of 6 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated. Earlier studies revealed that the transcription of genes for key enzymes like thymidylate synthase， thymidine kinase， and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase are regulated by 5-FU. This study identified some novel genes like thioredoxin reductase， ectonucleotide triphosphate dephosphorylase， and CTP synthase are regulated by 5-FU. The data also reveal large-scale perturbation in transcription of genes not involved directly in the known mechanism of action of 5-FU.
Mapping ATP-binding cassette transporter gene expression profiles in melanocytes and melanoma cells.,Melanoma Res, 2007 Oct,17885581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17885581/,TP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters regulate the transport of a variety of physiologic substrates. Moreover， several human ABC proteins are responsible for drug exclusion in compound-treated tumor cells， providing cellular mechanisms for the development of multidrug resistance and， therefore， playing an important role in malignant transformation. As only limited information exists on the role of ABC transporters in melanoma， the aim of the study was to generate a complete expression profile of ABC transporters in this tumor entity. Using a TaqMan low-density array for 47 human ABC transporters， mRNA expression analysis was performed from normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM P2 and NHEM P3)， nine different cell lines originating from primary melanoma (Mel Ei， Mel Juso， Mel Ho and Mel Wei)， and metastases of malignant melanoma (Mel Im， Mel Ju， SK Mel 28， HTZ 19 and HMB2). Cell line-specific expression levels were compared with gene expression in pooled RNA from a variety of other human tissues. High expression levels were detected in pooled tissue RNA as well as in cells of melanocytic origin for ABCA5， ABCB2， ABCB6， ABCD3， ABCD4， ABCF1， ABCF2 and ABCF3， whereas ABCB5 revealed a melanocyte-specific high transcript level. In relation to normal melanocytes， ABCB3， ABCB6， ABCC2， ABCC4， ABCE1 and ABCF2 were significantly increased in melanoma cell lines， whereas ABCA7， ABCA12， ABCB2， ABCB4， ABCB5 and ABCD1 showed lower expression levels. In summary， we present here for the first time an ABC-transporter mRNA expression profile in melanoma in comparison to normal melanocytes. The differentially regulated ABC transporters detected by our approach may be candidate genes involved in melanoma tumorigenesis， progression and therapy resistance and could therefore be of great importance to identify novel options for melanoma therapy.
A new description of cellular quiescence.,PLoS Biol, 2006 Mar,16509772,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16509772/,"Cellular quiescence， defined as reversible growth/proliferation arrest， is thought to represent a homogenous state induced by diverse anti-mitogenic signals. We used transcriptional profiling to characterize human diploid fibroblasts that exited the cell cycle after exposure to three independent signals--mitogen withdrawal， contact inhibition， and loss of adhesion. We show here that each signal caused regulation of a unique set of genes known to be important for cessation of growth and division. Therefore， contrary to expectation， cells enter different quiescent states that are determined by the initiating signal. However， underlying this diversity we discovered a set of genes whose specific expression in non-dividing cells was signal-independent， and therefore representative of quiescence per se， rather than the signal that induced it. This fibroblast ""quiescence program"" contained genes that enforced the non-dividing state， and ensured the reversibility of the cell cycle arrest. We further demonstrate that one mechanism by which the reversibility of quiescence is insured is the suppression of terminal differentiation. Expression of the quiescence program was not simply a downstream consequence of exit from the cell cycle， because key parts， including those involved in suppressing differentiation， were not recapitulated during the cell cycle arrest caused by direct inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases. These studies form a basis for understanding the normal biology of cellular quiescence."
MicroRNA expression changes during human leukemic HL-60 cell differentiation induced by 4-hydroxynonenal， a product of lipid peroxidation.,Free Radic Biol Med, 2009 Jan 15,19022373,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19022373/,4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) is one of several lipid oxidation products that may have an impact on human pathophysiology. It is an important second messenger involved in the regulation of various cellular processes and exhibits antiproliferative and differentiative properties in various tumor cell lines. The mechanisms by which HNE affects cell growth and differentiation are only partially clarified. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) have the ability to regulate several cellular processes， we hypothesized that HNE， in addition to other mechanisms， could affect miRNA expression. Here， we present the results of a genome-wide miRNA expression profiling of HNE-treated HL-60 leukemic cells. Among 470 human miRNAs， 10 were found to be differentially expressed between control and HNE-treated cells (at p<0.05). Six miRNAs were down-regulated (miR-181a*， miR-199b， miR-202， miR-378， miR-454-3p， miR-575) and 4 were up-regulated (miR-125a， miR-339， miR-663， miR-660). Three of these regulated miRNAs (miR-202， miR-339， miR-378) were further assayed and validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Moreover， consistent with the down-regulation of miR-378， HNE also induced the expression of the SUFU protein， a tumor suppressor recently identified as a target of miR-378. The finding that HNE could regulate the expression of miRNAs and their targets opens new perspectives on the understanding of HNE-controlled pathways. A functional analysis of 191 putative gene targets of miRNAs modulated by HNE is discussed.
Progesterone activates multiple innate immune pathways in Chlamydia trachomatis-infected endocervical cells.,Am J Reprod Immunol, 2014 Feb,24206234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24206234/,Problem:Susceptibility to Chlamydia trachomatis infection is increased by oral contraceptives and modulated by sex hormones. We therefore sought to determine the effects of female sex hormones on the innate immune response to C. trachomatis infection.Method of study:ECC-1 endometrial cells， pre-treated with oestradiol or progesterone， were infected with C. trachomatis and the host transcriptome analysed by Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 microarray. Primary endocervical epithelial cells， prepared at either the proliferative or secretory phase of the menstrual cycle， were infected with C. trachomatis and cytokine gene expression determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis.Results:Chlamydia trachomatis yield from progesterone-primed ECC-1 cells was significantly reduced compared with oestradiol-treated cells. Genes upregulated in progesterone-treated and Chlamydia-infected cells only included multiple CC and CXC chemokines， IL-17C， IL-29， IL-32， TNF-α， DEFB4B， LCN2， S100A7-9， ITGAM， NOD2， JAK1， IL-6ST， type I and II interferon receptors， numerous interferon-stimulated genes and STAT6. CXCL10， CXCL11， CX3 CL1 and IL-17C， which were also upregulated in infected secretory-stage primary cells， and there was a trend towards higher levels of immune mediators in infected secretory-phase compared with proliferative-phase cells.Conclusion:Progesterone treatment primes multiple innate immune pathways in hormone-responsive epithelial cells that could potentially increase resistance to chlamydial infection.Keywords:Chlamydia; gene array; innate immunity; progesterone.
Molecular characterization analysis of PANoptosis-related genes in colorectal cancer based on bioinformatic analysis.,PLoS One, 2024 Aug 26,39186800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39186800/,Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer globally and stands as the second principal contributor to cancer-related fatalities. Recently， emerging research has emphasized the role of pan apoptosis (PANoptosis) in tumor development and anti-tumor therapy. In the course of this investigation， we meticulously identified and conducted a correlation analysis between differentially expressed genes associated with PANoptosis in CRC (CPAN_DEGs) and the proportion of immune cells. Subsequently， we formulated a prognostic score based on the CPAN_DEGs. Further our analysis revealed a noteworthy reduction in UNC5D mRNA expression within HCT116， HT29 and SW480 cells， as validated by qRT-PCR assay. Furthermore， scrutinizing the TCGA database unveiled a distinctive trend wherein individuals with the low UNC5D expression exhibited significantly reduced overall survival compared to their counterparts with the high UNC5D levels. The drug susceptibility analysis of UNC5D was further performed， which showed that UNC5D was corassociated with the sensitivity of CRC to 6-Thioguanine. The outcomes of our investigation underscore the mechanisms by which PANoptosis influences immune dysregulation as well as prognostic outcome in CRC.
In vitro expansion of human nasoseptal chondrocytes reveals distinct expression profiles of G1 cell cycle inhibitors for replicative， quiescent， and senescent culture stages.,Tissue Eng, 2005 Jan-Feb,15738662,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15738662/,In vitro expansion of chondrocytes for tissue-engineering applications is limited by forms of growth arrest known as quiescence and replicative senescence. At the molecular level cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) are involved in mediating growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using ribonuclease protection assays and immunocytochemical staining methods， we quantitatively analyzed expression profiles of G1 cell cycle inhibitors at the mRNA and protein levels. These inhibitors included the CDKIs of the CIP/KIP family (p21CIP1 p27KIP1， and p57KIP2) and the INK4 family (p15INK4b， p16INK4a， p18INK4c， and p19INK4d) as well as the retinoblastoma protein-family (pRb， p107， and p130) and the tumor suppressor p53. Analysis was carried out in proliferating， quiescent， and senescent states of primary cultures of adult human nasoseptal chondrocytes. The most pronounced effect (p < 0.0001) between cultures in proliferation and cultures in growth arrest was an increased expression of the CDKIs p57KIP2 and p15INK4b for quiescent growth arrest， and of p16INK4a， p15INK4b， and p57KIP2 for senescent growth arrest. Thus， these cell cycle inhibitors represent potential candidates for selective intervention to promote cellular multiplication of chondrocytes undergoing in vitro expansion for tissue-engineering applications. Possible methods of modulation include the targeted elimination of specifically identified cell cycle inhibitors by antisense technologies.
Progestin upregulates G-protein-coupled receptor 30 in breast cancer cells.,Eur J Biochem, 2002 May,12027886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12027886/, differential display method was used to study genes the expression of which is altered during growth inhibition induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). A transcript of G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) was upregulated by MPA in estrogen-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Northern-blot analysis showed a progestin-specific primary target gene， which was enhanced by progesterone and different progestins， but not by dihydrotestosterone or dexamethasone， and which was abrogated by antiprogestin RU486. The dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in GPR30 mRNA expression correlated with MPA-induced growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells. Additionally， GPR30 upregulation by progestin correlated with growth inhibition when a comparison was made between different breast cancer cell lines. The ERK1/ERK2 pathway is capable of inducing progesterone receptor-dependent and ligand-dependent transcription. Thus we sought to establish whether different MAPK pathway inhibitors affect progestin-induced GPR30 mRNA regulation. The regulation of GPR30 was independent of ERK pathway activation， but the p38 pathway inhibitor induced GPR30 expression， which suggested a potential gene regulation pathway. These data demonstrate a new progestin target gene， the expression of which correlates with growth inhibition.
Orexin-A stimulates the expression of GLUT4 in a glucose dependent manner in the liver of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides).,Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol, 2016 Sep,27264958,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27264958/,Orexins are hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in the central regulation of feeding behavior， sleep-wake cycle and other physiological functions. Orexin-A can regulate energy metabolism and increase glucose uptake， suggesting a role in glucose metabolism. In this study， we investigated the effects of orexin-A on GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels and the intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating orexin-A activity in the hepatocytes of grouper. Our results demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection of orexin-A increased the expression of GLUT4 in the liver， and this effect was significantly enhanced by co-injection of glucose. Treatment of primary cultured hepatocytes with either orexin-A or glucose alone had no effect on the expression of GLUT4， while co-treatment with orexin-A and glucose significantly increased the expression of GLUT4. This stimulatory effect was partially blocked by inhibitors to ERK1/2， JNK or p38 MAPK and was further blocked by an orexin receptor antagonist， which indicates that orexin-A could stimulate the expression of GLUT4 in a glucose dependent manner in primary hepatocytes via ERK1/2， JNK and p38 signaling. Our results suggest that orexin-A could play a pivotal role in stimulating glucose utilization in grouper， for a long-term goal， which might be useful in reducing costs in the aquaculture industry.Keywords:GLUT4; Glucose; Hepatocytes; Orexin-A; Signaling pathway.
Characterization of the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene expression profile in Y79: a retinoblastoma cell line.,Mol Cell Biochem, 2009 Aug,19266166,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19266166/,Chemotherapy failure was reported in treatment of retinoblastoma suggesting a role for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. Little is known about the expression pattern of ABC proteins in this cancer type. We investigated the gene expression profile of 47 ABC proteins in the human retinoblastoma cell line Y79 by TaqMan low-density array. Analysis revealed 31 ABC transporter genes expressed in this tumor cell line. Y79 cells demonstrate high gene expression of ABCA7， ABCA12， ABCB7， ABCB10， ABCC1， ABCC4， ABCD3， ABCE1， ABCF1， ABCF2， and ABCF3 (more than twofold compared to pooled RNA from different tissues). Moreover， we show that Y79 cells exhibit an active calcein efflux pointing to multidrug resistance protein (MRP)-like transporter activity. In summary， we present for the first time an ABC transporter gene expression profile in cells derived from retinoblastoma. Most of the highly expressed ABC transporter genes are typical markers of cancer cells and might exhibit potential targets for medical treatment of retinoblastoma.
C24-hydroxylated stigmastane derivatives as Liver X Receptor agonists.,Chem Phys Lipids, 2018 May,29352964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29352964/,Phytosterols are stucturally correlated to the endogenous ligands of Liver X Receptor (LXR)， a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that has emerged as an attractive drug target due to its ability to integrate metabolic and inflammatory signaling. Natural and semi-synthetic phytosterol derivatives characterized by the presence of side-chain oxygenated functions have shown to be able to modulate LXR activity. Here， we describe the efficient synthesis of four stigmastane derivatives， endowed with a hydroxyl group at C24 position， namely (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5，28-diene-3β，24-ols (also referred to as saringosterols， 10a and 10b) and (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3β，24-ols (11a and 11b)， starting from the readily available stigmasterol. Thanks to X-ray crystallography the absolute configuration of the newly created chiral centers was definitively assigned for all the four compounds. The subsequent luciferase assays with GAL-4 chimeric receptors evidenced the ability of the two 24(S)-epimers， 10b and 11b， to interact with LXRs， showing the same degree of affinity as (22R)-hydroxycholesterol (1). With regard to the isoform selectivity both the derivatives 10b and 11b showed a preference for LXRβ， up to 4-fold in terms of efficacy for 11b. The gene expression profiling of (24S)-stigmasta-5，28-diene-3β，24-ol (10a) and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3β，24-ol (11a) demonstrated the capability of both the compounds to induce the expression of four well-known LXR target genes， such as ABCA1， SREBP1c， FASN， and SCD1 in U937 monocytic cell line， thus supporting the hypothesis they were LXR positive modulators.Keywords:LXR; Liver X Receptor; Natural products; Oxysterols; Phytosterols; Saringosterol; Stigmastane derivatives.
Characterization of hybrid cells derived from spontaneous fusion events between breast epithelial cells exhibiting stem-like characteristics and breast cancer cells.,Clin Exp Metastasis, 2011 Jan,20981475,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20981475/,Several data of the past years clearly indicated that the fusion of tumor cells and tumor cells or tumor cells and normal cells can give rise to hybrids cells exhibited novel properties such as an increased malignancy， drug resistance， or resistance to apoptosis. In the present study we characterized hybrid cells derived from spontaneous fusion events between the breast epithelial cell line M13SV1-EGFP-Neo and two breast cancer cell lines: HS578T-Hyg and MDA-MB-435-Hyg. Short-tandem-repeat analysis revealed an overlap of parental alleles in all hybrid cells indicating that hybrid cells originated from real cell fusion events. RealTime-PCR-array gene expression data provided evidence that each hybrid cell clone exhibited a unique gene expression pattern， resulting in a specific resistance of hybrid clones towards chemotherapeutic drugs， such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel， as well as a specific migratory behavior of hybrid clones towards EGF. For instance， M13MDA435-4 hybrids showed a marked resistance towards etoposide， doxorubicin and paclitaxel， whereas hybrid clones M13MDA-435-1 and -2 were only resistant towards etoposide. Likewise， all investigated M13MDA435 hybrids responded to EGF with an increased migratory activity， whereas the migration of parental MDA-MB-435-Hyg cells was blocked by EGF， suggesting that M13MDA435 hybrids may have acquired a new motility pathway. Similar findings have been obtained for M13HS hybrids. We conclude from our data that they further support the hypothesis that cell fusion could give rise to drug resistant and migratory active tumor (hybrid) cells in cancer.
Survival features of EBV-stabilized cells from centenarians: morpho-functional and transcriptomic analyses.,Age (Dordr), 2012 Dec,21904824,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21904824/,"In the present work， we analyzed the survival features of six different Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-stabilized lymphoid cell lines obtained from adult subjects and from subjects of more than 95 years. For the first， we found that lymphoid B cells from centenarians were more resistant to apoptosis induction and displayed a more developed lysosomal compartment， the most critical component of phagic machinery， in comparison with lymphoid B cells from adult subjects. In addition， cells from centenarians were capable of engulfing and digesting other cells， i.e.， their siblings (even entire cells)， whereas lymphoid cells from ""control samples""， i.e.， from adults， did not. This behavior was improved by nutrient deprivation but， strikingly， it was unaffected by the autophagy-modulating drug， rapamycin， an autophagy inducer， and 3-methyladenine， an autophagy inhibitor. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that: (1) aspartyl proteases， (2) cell surface molecules such as integrins and cadherins， and (3) some components of cytoskeletal network could contribute to establish this survival phenotype. Also， Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways such as Wnt signaling pathway， an essential contributor to cell migration and actin cytoskeleton remodeling， appeared as prominent. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that EBV-immortalization could play a role， since we observed this phagic behavior in cells from centenarians but not in those from adults， we hypothesize that it may represent an important survival determinant in cells from centenarians."
Hypoxia-mediated autophagic flux inhibits silver nanoparticle-triggered apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.,Sci Rep, 2016 Feb 12,26867977,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26867977/,Solid tumors are frequently associated with resistance to chemotherapy because the fraction of hypoxic tumor cells is substantial. To understand the underlying mechanism of hypoxia on silver nanoparticle (AgNPs)-induced apoptosis， the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α， a hallmark of hypoxia， was measured in the presence and absence of AgNPs. The results showed that HIF-1α expression was upregulated after AgNPs treatment under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Cell viability assays showed that AgNPs promoted cell death in cancer cells but not in non-cancer cells， as cancer cells are slightly more acidic than normal cells. However， reactive oxygen species generation induced by AgNPs in lung cancer cells caused high susceptibility to oxidative stress， whereas pre-exposure to hypoxia blocked AgNPs-induced oxidative stress. Notably， HIF-1α inhibited AgNPs-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by regulating autophagic flux through the regulation of ATG5， LC3-II， and p62. Further， cell viability after treatment of cancer cells with AgNPs under hypoxic conditions was lower in HIF-1α siRNA-transfected cells than in control siRNA-transfected cells， indicating that HIF-1α knockdown enhances hypoxia induced decrease in cell viability. Our results suggest that hypoxia-mediated autophagy may be a mechanism for the resistance of AgNPs-induced apoptosis and that strategies targeting HIF-1α may be used for cancer therapy.
Osteoblast-induced EGFR/ERBB2 signaling in androgen-sensitive prostate carcinoma cells characterized by multiplex kinase activity profiling.,Clin Exp Metastasis, 2009,19294521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294521/,Bone metastases in prostate cancer are predominantly osteoblastic. To study regulatory mechanisms underlying the establishment of prostate cancer within an osteoblastic microenvironment， human androgen-sensitive prostate carcinoma cells (LNCaP) were treated with culture medium conditioned by human osteoblast-derived sarcoma cells (OHS)， and activated signalling pathways in the carcinoma cells were analyzed using microarrays with tyrosine kinase substrates. Network interaction analysis of substrates with significantly increased phosphorylation levels revealed that signalling pathways mediated by EGFR and ERBB2 were activated in LNCaP cells under OHS influence but also by androgen treatment. Activation of EGFR/ERBB2 signalling was also found in LNCaP cells in cocultures with OHS cells or osteoblastic cells that had been differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells. Our experimental data suggests osteoblast-directed induction of signalling activity via EGFR and ERBB2 in prostate carcinoma cells and may provide a rationale for the use of EGFR or ERBB2 inhibition in systemic prevention or treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in the androgen-sensitive stage of the disease.
Assessment of the TRPM8 inhibitor AMTB in breast cancer cells and its identification as an inhibitor of voltage gated sodium channels.,Life Sci, 2018 Apr 1,29496495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29496495/,ims:To assess levels of the calcium permeable transient receptor potential cation channel， subfamily melastatin， member 8 (TRPM8) in breast cancer molecular subtypes and to assess the consequences of TRPM8 pharmacological inhibition with AMTB (an inhibitor of TRPM8) on breast cancer cell lines.Materials and methods:Cell viability and migration of breast cancer cells was determined using MTS assays and wound healing assays， respectively. RNA-Seq analysis of breast tumours and qPCR in breast cancer cell lines were used to assess mRNA levels of ion channels. Membrane potential assays were employed to assess the effects of AMTB against specific voltage gated sodium channels (NaV).Key findings:TRPM8 levels were significantly higher in breast cancers of the basal molecular subtype. AMTB decreased viable cell number in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines (30 and 100 μM)， and also reduced the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (30 μM). However， these effects were independent of TRPM8， as no TRPM8 mRNA was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells. AMTB was identified as an inhibitor of NaVisoforms. NaV1.1-1.9 were expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines， with NaV1.5 mRNA highest in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the other breast cancer cell lines assessed.Significance:TRPM8 levels may be elevated in basal breast cancers， however， TRPM8 expression appears to be lost in many breast cancer cell lines. Some of the effects of AMTB attributed to TRPM8 may be due to effects on NaVchannels.Keywords:AMTB; Breast cancer; Sodium channels; TRPM8.
Toll-like receptor agonist R848 blocks Zika virus replication by inducing the antiviral protein viperin.,Virology, 2018 Sep,30036788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30036788/,Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen linked to neurological disorders for which there is currently no targeted therapy. To identify host innate immune response proteins that restrict ZIKV replication， we treated monocytes and macrophages with toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Of those tested， the TLR7/8 agonist R848 (resiquimod) was the most potent inhibitor of ZIKV replication. RNA-seq analysis identified several genes strongly induced by R848 in monocytes. Testing of several of these for their ability to restrict ZIKV replication identified viperin， an interferon-induced gene active against several viruses. Transduction of microglial CHME3 cells with a viperin lentiviral expression vector rendered them resistant to ZIKV infection， preventing the synthesis of viral RNA and protein. CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out of viperin in macrophages relieved the block to infection， demonstrating that viperin is a major innate immune response protein able to block ZIKV replication. TLR agonists may be useful for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for ZIKV.Keywords:Monocytes; R848; RNA synthesis; TLR7/8; Viperin; ZIKV restriction.

Molecular determinants of response to high-dose androgen therapy in prostate cancer.,JCI Insight, 2019 Oct 3,31503550,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31503550/,Clinical trials of high-dose androgen (HDA) therapy for prostate cancer (PC) have shown promising efficacy but are limited by lack of criteria to identify likely responders. To elucidate factors that govern the growth-repressive effects of HDAs， we applied an unbiased integrative approach using genetic screens and transcriptional profiling of PC cells with or without demonstrated phenotypic sensitivity to androgen-mediated growth repression. Through this comprehensive analysis， we identified genetic events and related signaling networks that determine the response to both HDA and androgen withdrawal. We applied these findings to develop a gene signature that may serve as an early indicator of treatment response and identify men with tumors that are amenable to HDA therapy.Keywords:Cancer; Genetics; Oncology; Prostate cancer; Tumor suppressors.
5-Fluorouracil in combination with cisplatin alters the microRNA expression profile in the CNE nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line.,Mol Med Rep, 2012 Aug,22614822,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22614822/,Chemotherapy constitutes one of the chief supplementary methods in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin are classic chemotherapeutic drugs that have been widely used for NPC treatment. Although the aberrant expression of protein-coding genes has been observed after chemotherapy， the regulatory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly identified class of small regulatory RNAs involved in multiple biological processes and metabolic regulation， including the initiation， progression and metastasis of human cancers. In this study， using a label-free high-throughput microRNA array technology， the stacking-hybridized universal tag (SHUT) assay， we show that 5-FU in combination with cisplatin significantly alters the global expression profile of miRNAs in CNE cells. After 48 h of treatment with a low dose [10% inhibitory concentration (IC10)] of 5-FU and/or cisplatin， numerous key miRNAs were shown to be regulated. Compared to the 431 miRNAs detected in the control cells， 184 miRNAs were significantly expressed in the 5-FU-treated cells， while 336 miRNAs were expressed in the cisplatin-treated cells and 13 miRNAs in the cells treated with the combination of both drugs. The majority of these miRNAs are associated with cancer development， progression and metastasis. This is the first time that miRNA expression profiles in the CNE cell line are shown. Our findings elucidate a potential mechanism involved in the chemotherapy of NPC and provide new clues for the treatment of NPC.Keywords:nasopharyngeal carcinoma; CNE cell line; microRNA; microarray; 5-fluorouracil; cisplatin; chemotherapy.
Widespread estrogen-dependent repression of micrornas involved in breast tumor cell growth.,Cancer Res, 2009 Nov 1,19826037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19826037/,ltered expression of microRNAs (miRNA)， an abundant class of small nonprotein-coding RNAs that mostly function as negative regulators of protein-coding gene expression， is common in cancer. Here， we analyze the regulation of miRNA expression in response to estrogen， a steroid hormone that is involved in the development and progression of breast carcinomas and that is acting via the estrogen receptors (ER) transcription factors. We set out to thoroughly describe miRNA expression， by using miRNA microarrays and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments， in various breast tumor cell lines in which estrogen signaling has been induced by 17beta-estradiol (E(2)). We show that the expression of a broad set of miRNAs decreases following E(2) treatment in an ER-dependent manner. We further show that enforced expression of several of the repressed miRNAs reduces E(2)-dependent cell growth， thus linking expression of specific miRNAs with estrogen-dependent cellular response. In addition， a transcriptome analysis revealed that the E(2)-repressed miR-26a and miR-181a regulate many genes associated with cell growth and proliferation， including the progesterone receptor gene， a key actor in estrogen signaling. Strikingly， miRNA expression is also regulated in breast cancers of women who had received antiestrogen neoadjuvant therapy. Overall， our data indicate that the extensive alterations in miRNA regulation upon estrogen signaling pathway play a key role in estrogen-dependent functions and highlight the utility of considering miRNA expression in the understanding of antiestrogen resistance of breast cancer.
Decitabine induces G2/M cell cycle arrest by suppressing p38/NF-κB signaling in human renal clear cell carcinoma.,Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 2015 Sep 1,26617834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26617834/,Objective:The anti-neoplastic effects of decitabine， an inhibitor of DNA promoter methylation， are beneficial for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however， the mechanism of action of decitabine is unclear. We analyzed gene expression profiling and identified specific pathways altered by decitabine in RCC cells.Methods:Four human RCC cell lines (ACHN， Caki-1， Caki-1， and A498) were used in this study; growth suppression of RCC cells by decitabine was analyzed using the WST-1 assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were examined using flow cytometric analysis. Gene expression of RCC cells induced by decitabine was evaluated with cDNA microarray， and potential biological pathways were selected using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The activity of the p38-NF-κB pathway regulated by decitabine was confirmed by Western blotting.Results:Decitabine suppresses the proliferation of RCC cells in vitro. Although decitabine did not significantly induce apoptosis， decitabine caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression regulated by decitabine in RCC cells was investigated using microarray analysis. Ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1)， interferon inducible protein 27 (IFI27)， and cell division cycle-associated 2 (CDCA2) may be involved in growth suppression of RCC cells by decitabine. The phosphorylation of p38-NF-κB pathway was suppressed by decitabine in RCC cells.Conclusions:We investigated gene expression profiling and pathways modulated by decitabine in RCC cells. Decitabine was shown to suppress the growth of RCC cells via G2/M cell cycle arrest and the p38-NF-κB signaling pathway may play a role in the anti-neoplastic effect of decitabine in RCC cells.Keywords:Renal cell carcinoma; apoptosis; cell cycle arrest; decitabine; gene expression; p38-NF-κB pathway.

Transcriptomic identification of differentially expressed genes in Levonorgestrel resistant endometrial cancer cell lines.,Mol Carcinog, 2023 Jul,37067396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37067396/,Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the world and incidence is steadily increasing. The Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS) is an alternative conservative treatment for early-stage EC， however， Levonorgestrel (LNG) resistance occurs for 1 in 3 people. This study aimed to present potential LNG resistance mechanisms and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EC cell lines. Two LNG resistant cell lines were developed through long term culture in LNG (MFE296Rand MFE319R). Whole transcriptome sequencing was carried out on triplicate RNA samples. EdgeR v3.32.1 was used to identify differentially DEGs. Blast2go V6.0 (BioBam software) was used for functional annotation and analysis of genomic datasets. Protein interactions were investigated using the STRING database， including the identification of genes with high levels of interaction (HUB genes). Select DEGs and HUB genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Fifteen DEGs were identified according to FDR < 0.05 and logFC < 2. Protein analysis identified six HUB genes with a degree of connectivity > 10. Relative mRNA expression of MAOA， MAOB， THRSP， CD80， NDP， LINC01474， DUSP2 and CXCL8 was significantly upregulated in both LNGRcell lines. Relative protein expression of GNAO1 and MAOA were significantly upregulated in both LNGRcell lines. This research identified novel markers of resistance in LNGRcell lines. We discussed potential mechanisms of LNG resistance including dedifferentiation and immunostimulation. The next step for this research is to validate these findings further in both translational and clinical settings.Keywords:Levonorgestrel-Intrauterine-System; bioinformatics; endometrial cancer; progesterone; resistance; transcriptome sequencing.
Micro(mi)RNA expression profile of breast cancer epithelial cells treated with the anti-diabetic drug metformin: induction of the tumor suppressor miRNA let-7a and suppression of the TGFbeta-induced oncomiR miRNA-181a.,Cell Cycle, 2011 Apr 1,21368581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21368581/,n unexplored molecular scenario that might explain the inhibitory impact of the anti-diabetic drug metformin on the genesis of breast cancer relates to metformin's ability to modulate the expression status of micro (mi)RNAs. We here report the first miRNA expression profiling of human epithelial breast cancer cells cultured in the presence of metformin. We conducted real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Arrays to quantitatively compare the expression profile of 88 cancer-related miRNA sequences before and after treatment of MCF-7 cells， which were used as well-differentiated， epithelioid cell controls， with graded concentrations of metformin. Metformin-treated MCF-7 cells notably exhibited up to 18-fold increases in miRNA lethal-7a (let-7a) expression compared with untreated control cells. We confirmed that MCF-7 cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in response to the cytokine TGFβ notably up-regulated (~5-fold) miRNA-181a expression and exhibited better mammosphere-forming capabilities. We then explored the ability of metformin to impede TGFβ-enhanced propensity of breast cancer stem cells to form mammospheres in a miRNA-181a-related manner. Remarkably， TGFβ treatment failed to up-regulate miRNA-181a expression in the presence of metformin， which was able to fully abrogate TGFβ-enhanced mammosphere-forming ability. In addition， metformin co-treatment fully prevented TGFβ-induced down-regulation of the tumor suppressor miRNA-96 (~10-fold). Metformin's molecular functioning to prevent invasive breast cancer can be explained in terms of its previously unrecognized ability to efficiently up-regulate the tumor-suppressive miRNAs let-7a & miRNA-96 and inhibit the oncogenic miRNA-181a， thus epigenetically preserving the differentiated phenotype of mammary epithelium while preventing EMT-related cancer-initiating cell self-renewal.
Investigating the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of sunitinib upon K-562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line and assessment of gene profiling.,J Cancer Res Ther, 2020 Jan-Mar,32362626,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32362626/,"Objective:Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which efficiently inhibit BCR-ABL are highly effective for clinical treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)， but development of resistance to TKIs is a big challenge to treatment. Sunitinib is a multitargeted TKI targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and is defined a safe and effective candidate target， but its effect on other signaling pathways is unknown. To investigate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of sunitinib in CML cell model K-562 on JAK-STAT signaling pathway components， suppressor genes and oncogenes， hematopoiesis-related genes， cell cycle and VEGF pathway components， and mRNA level expression changes was aimed.Materials and methods:Sunitinib's effective dose cytotoxic IC50was determined by trypan blue and WST-1 cell proliferation assay tests. Expression levels of target genes were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction simultaneously after sunitinib application. Protein expression analysis was determined by ""WesternBreeze Chromogenic Kit-Anti-Rabbit"" based on the principles of the application kit by Western blot analysis.Results:Assessing the cytotoxicity of K-562 cells following sunitinib treatment revealed that sunitinib decreased cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. According to the sunitinib inhibition curve， IC50 dose was calculated as 3.5 μM at 48thh for K-562 cells and apoptosis assays pointed that sunitinib induces apoptotic cell death of leukemic cells at moderate levels.Conclusion:Our study supports that sunitinib might be used as a novel therapeutic target to trigger apoptosis in CML cells which in turn might accelerate therapeutic response in regard to inhibiting oncogenes and enhancing tumor suppressors in cooperation with cell cycle regulatory genes.Keywords:Apoptosis; cell line; chronic myeloid leukemia; sunitinib."
Hypertension Susceptibility Loci are Associated with Anthracycline-related Cardiotoxicity in Long-term Childhood Cancer Survivors.,Sci Rep, 2017 Aug 29,28851949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28851949/,nthracycline-based chemotherapy is associated with dose-dependent， irreversible damage to the heart. Childhood cancer survivors with hypertension after anthracycline exposure are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity， leading to the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility loci for hypertension may serve as predictors for development of late cardiotoxicity. Therefore， we determined the association between 12 GWAS-identified hypertension-susceptibility loci and cardiotoxicity in a cohort of long-term childhood cancer survivors (N = 108) who received anthracyclines and were screened for cardiac function via echocardiograms. Hypertension-susceptibility alleles of PLCE1:rs9327264 and ATP2B1:rs17249754 were significantly associated with cardiotoxicity risk conferring a protective effect with a 64% (95% CI: 0.18-0.76， P = 0.0068) and 74% (95% CI: 0.07-0.96， P = 0.040) reduction in risk， respectively. In RNAseq experiments of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin， both PLCE1 and ATP2B1 displayed anthracycline-dependent gene expression profiles. In silico functional assessment further supported this relationship - rs9327264 in PLCE1 (P = 0.0080) and ATP2B1 expression (P = 0.0079) were both significantly associated with daunorubicin IC50values in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that the hypertension-susceptibility variants in PLCE1 and ATP2B1 confer a protective effect on risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity， and functional analyses suggest that these genes are influenced by exposure to anthracyclines.

The extract of huanglian， a medicinal herb， induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis by upregulation of interferon-beta and TNF-alpha in human breast cancer cells.,Carcinogenesis, 2005 Nov,15958519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15958519/,Huanglian (Coptidis rhizoma)， a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine， has been shown recently to possess anticancer activities. However， the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of the herb is poorly understood. Specifically， whether huanglian extract affects the expression of cancer-related genes has not been defined. This study used DNA microarray technology to examine the effect of the herbal extract on expression of the common genes involved in carcinogenesis in two human breast cancer cell lines， the ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment of the cancer cells with huanglian extract markedly inhibited their proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The growth inhibitory effect was much more profound in MCF-7 cell line than that in MDA-MB-231 cells. DNA microarray assay revealed that treatment with huanglian dramatically increased the mRNA expression of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in MCF-7 cells. Quantitative analysis by real-time PCR or western blotting confirmed the upregulation of the two genes (especially IFN-beta) in MCF-7 cells， but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. Addition of neutralizing antibody against IFN-beta to culture medium markedly inhibited the huanglian-induced antiproliferative effect， confirming the involvement of IFN-beta in the huanglian's effect and also suggesting an autocrine pathway for the action of IFN-beta in this setting. Given that IFN-beta is among the most important anticancer cytokines， the upregulation of this gene by huanglian is， at least in part， responsible for its antiproliferative effect. The results of this study implicate huanglian as a promising herb for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of certain cancers.
Lycopene modulates THP1 and Caco2 cells inflammatory state through transcriptional and nontranscriptional processes.,Mediators Inflamm, 2014,24891766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24891766/,We revisited the action of a carotenoid， the lycopene， on the expression of proinflammatory genes， reactive oxygen species (ROS) production， and metalloprotease (MMP9) activity. THP1 and Caco2 cell lines were used as in vitro models for the two main cell types found in intestine tissue， that is， monocytes and epithelial cells. Proinflammatory condition was induced using either phorbol ester acetate (PMA)， lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In THP1 cells， short term pretreatment (2 h) with a low concentration (2 μM) of lycopene reinforce proinflammatory gene expression. The extent of the effect of lycopene is dependent on the proinflammtory stimulus (PMA， LPS or TNF) used. Lycopene enhanced MMP9 secretion via a c-AMP-dependent process， and reduced ROS production at higher concentrations than 2 μM. Cell culture media， conditioned by PMA-treated monocytes and then transferred on CaCo-2 epithelial cells， induced a proinflammatory state in these cells. The extent of this inflammatory effect was reduced when cells has been pretreated (12 h) with lycopene. At low concentration (2 μM or less)， lycopene appeared to promote an inflammatory state not correlated with ROS modulation. At higher concentration (5 μM-20 μM)， an anti-inflammatory effect takes place as a decrease of ROS production was detected. So， both concentration and time have to be considered in order to define the exact issue of the effect of carotenoids present in meals.

Exendin-4 restores glucolipotoxicity-induced gene expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2012 Mar 23,22390929,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22390929/,Exendin-4， a stable GLP-1 receptor agonist， has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion. It has also been shown to exert beneficial effects on endothelial function that are independent of its glycemic effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying the protective actions of exendin-4 against diabetic glucolipotoxicity in endothelial cells largely remain elusive. We have investigated the long-term in vitro effect of palmitate or high glucose (simulating the diabetic milieu) and the role of exendin-4 on gene expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Gene expression profiling in combination with Western blotting revealed that exendin-4 regulates expression of a number of genes involved in angiogenesis， inflammation and thrombogenesis under glucolipotoxic conditions. Our results indicate that exendin-4 may improve endothelial cell function in diabetes through regulating expression of the genes， whose expression was disrupted by glucolipotoxicity. As endothelial dysfunction appears to be an early indicator of vascular damage， and predicts both progression of atherosclerosis and incidence of cardiovascular events， exendin-4 and possibly other incretin-based strategies may confer additional cardiovascular benefit beyond improved glycemic control.

Recombinant vascular basement membrane derived multifunctional peptide blocks endothelial cell angiogenesis and neovascularization.,J Cell Biochem, 2010 Oct 1,20524205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20524205/,ngiogenesis is an innovative target in the therapy of cancer and other diseases， but the effects of anti-angiogenic drugs have been rather modest in clinical trials. We have developed a small peptide， recombinant vascular basement membrane derived multifunctional peptide (rVBMDMP)， which significantly inhibits endothelial cells in vitro. Here we test the mechanisms of rVBMDMP in angiogenesis balance in assays of tubule formation， colony formation， and apoptosis in HUVE-12 endothelial cells. We also analyzed the differential expression of phosphorylation proteins and related genes in a protein phosphorylation chip and extracellular matrix adhesion molecule cDNA microarray， and validated changes with Western blot or real-time quantitative PCR， respectively. rVBMDMP dose-dependently inhibited colony formation， induced apoptosis， and inhibited in vitro tubule formation. rVBMDMP increased the phosphorylation of 88 signal proteins， including caspase-3， death receptor 3， 4， and 5， and integrin αV， β1， and β3， and down-regulated 41 signal proteins， including EGFR， pEGFR， VEGFR-1， and survivin versus control. rVBMDMP upregulated 14 genes， including collagen 4， 7， and 27， and down-regulated 21 genes， including integrin αVβ3， MMP10， and MMP12. Our study suggests that rVBMDMP inhibits angiogenesis and may be a viable drug candidate in anti-angiogenesis and anticancer therapies.
Collagen Peptide in a Combinatorial Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus Inhibits the Cariogenic Properties of Streptococcus mutans: An In Vitro Study.,Int J Mol Sci, 2022 Feb 7,35163782,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35163782/,Dental caries is caused by the formation of cariogenic biofilm， leading to localized areas of enamel demineralization.Streptococcus mutans， a cariogenic pathogen， has long been considered as a microbial etiology of dental caries. We hypothesized that an antagonistic approach using a prebiotic collagen peptide in combination with probioticLactobacillus rhamnosuswould modulate the virulence of this cariogenic biofilm. In vitroS. mutansbiofilms were formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs， and the inhibitory effect of a combination ofL. rhamnosusand collagen peptide onS. mutansbiofilms were evaluated using microbiological， biochemical， confocal imaging， and transcriptomic analyses. The combination ofL. rhamnosuswith collagen peptide altered acid production byS. mutans， significantly increasing culture pH at an early stage of biofilm formation. Moreover， the 3D architecture of theS. mutansbiofilm was greatly compromised when it was in the presence ofL. rhamnosuswith collagen peptide， resulting in a significant reduction in exopolysaccharide with unstructured and mixed bacterial organization. The presence ofL. rhamnosuswith collagen peptide modulated the virulence potential ofS. mutansvia down-regulation ofeno，ldh， andatpDcorresponding to acid production and proton transportation， whereasaguDassociated with alkali production was up-regulated. Gly-Pro-Hyp， a common tripeptide unit of collagen， consistently modulated the cariogenic potential ofS. mutansby inhibiting acid production， similar to the bioactivity of a collagen peptide. It also enhanced the relative abundance of commensal streptococci (S. oralis) in a mixed-species biofilm by inhibitingS. mutanscolonization and dome-like microcolony formation. This work demonstrates that food-derived synbiotics may offer a useful means of disrupting cariogenic communities and maintaining microbial homeostasis.Keywords:acidogenicity; aciduricity; cariogenic biofilms; metabolic interference; prebiotics; probiotics; synbiotics.

Berberine inhibits cell growth and mediates caspase-independent cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells.,Planta Med, 2010 Aug,20455200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20455200/,Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human malignancies with an increasing incidence worldwide. In addition to the poor survival rates， combinations using gemcitabine as a backbone have failed to show any benefit beyond monotherapy. These facts underscore an urgent need for novel therapeutic options and motivated us to study the effect of berberine on pancreatic cancer cells. Here， we undertook an mRNA-based gene expression profiling study in order to get deeper insight into the molecular targets mediating the growth inhibitory effects of berberine on pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal ones. Twenty-four hours after treatment， berberine showed preferential selectivity toward pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal ones. Moreover， expression profiling and Ingenuity pathway analysis results showed that the cytotoxicity of berberine was accompanied with an activation of BRCA1-mediated DNA damage response， G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint regulation， and P53 signalling pathways. The activation of these signalling pathways might be explained by the fact that berberine intercalates DNA and induces DNA strand break through inhibition of topoisomerases and induction of DNA lesions.
Syngeneic cardiac and bone marrow stromal cells display tissue-specific microRNA signatures and microRNA subsets restricted to diverse differentiation processes.,PLoS One, 2014 Sep 18,25232725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25232725/,MicroRNAs are key modulators at molecular level in different biological processes， including determination of cell fate and differentiation. Herein， microRNA expression profiling experiments were performed on syngeneic cardiac (CStC) and bone marrow (BMStC) mesenchymal stromal cells cultured in standard growth medium and then in vitro exposed to adipogenic， osteogenic， cardiomyogenic and endothelial differentiation media. Analysis identified a tissue-specific microRNA signature composed of 16 microRNAs that univocally discriminated cell type of origin and that were completely unaffected by in vitro differentiation media: 4 microRNAs were over-expressed in cardiac stromal cells， and 12 were overexpressed or present only in bone marrow stromal cells. Further， results revealed microRNA subsets specifically modulated by each differentiation medium， irrespective of the cell type of origin， and a subset of 7 microRNAs that were down-regulated by all media with respect to growth medium. Finally， we identified 16 microRNAs that were differentially modulated by the media when comparing the two tissues of origin. The existence of a tissue-specific microRNA signature surviving to any differentiation stimuli， strongly support the role if microRNAs determining cell identity related to tissue origin. Moreover， we identified microRNA subsets modulated by different culture conditions in a tissue-specific manner， pointing out their importance during differentiation processes.
Identification of key genes， regulatory factors， and drug target genes of recurrent implantation failure (RIF).,Gynecol Endocrinol, 2020 May,31646911,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31646911/,Objective:Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) exacerbates the physical trauma of infertile women that undergone invitrofertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). We aimed to identify the key genes， regulatory factors， and drug target genes involved in the RIF.Methods:The dataset GSE58144 that obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus mainly contained 43 RIF and 72 control endometrial samples. Differently expressed genes (DEGs) between RIF and control groups were firstly analyzed， followed by the pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Then， protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and miRNA-transcript factor (TF)-DEGs network were established. Finally， a drug-target interaction network was constructed.Results:A total of 399 DEGs were identified between the RIF and controls. In the PPI and key module network，UBE2I，PLK4，XPO1，AURKB， andNUP107were identified as the hub genes， which mainly enriched in RNA transport and cell division cycle-related pathways and GO items. In the miRNA-TF-DEGs network， E2F4， SIN3A， miRNA489， miRNA199A， miRNA369-3P， miRNA422， and miRNA522 were considered as the key regulatory factors during RIF. In addition， HTR1A， NR3C1， and GABRA3 were the main targets of the drugs annotated in DrugBank.Conclusion:The effects of PLK4， XPO1， AURKB， and NUP107 on the RIF may be via affecting the proliferation and differentiation of endometrial stromal cells. Besides， SIN3A and miRNA199A may be crucial for embryo implantation. In addition， NR3C1 may be used as a possible target for the clinical therapy of RIF.Keywords:NR3C1; Recurrent implantation failure; drug-target interaction; endometrium; miRNAs-TFs-DEGs network; protein-protein interaction network.
Texosome-anchored superantigen triggers apoptosis in original ovarian cancer cells.,Med Oncol, 2015 Jan,25452173,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452173/,Texosomes， nano-endosomal vesicles， are candidates for cancer immunotherapy due to their immunostimulating properties. We designed a new structure based on texosome and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and assessed its cytotoxic impact on an ovarian cell line. Texosomes were isolated from tumor cells， and SEB was anchored onto by protein transfer method. MTT assay and Hoechst staining were used to identify the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of this compound on treated cells with different concentrations of texosome-SEB (TEX-SEB). Moreover， the expression rate of bcl-2， bax， bak， bcl-xl and the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were investigated. Treatments of the cells with 0.5， 2.5 and 10 μg/100 μl TEX-SEB were significantly cytotoxic within 24 h (p < 0.001). Hoechst staining revealed that all tested concentrations caused apoptosis after 24 h compared with the control cells (p < 0.001). Furthermore， it was found that treatment with all examined concentrations of TEX-SEB enhanced caspase-9 activity after 24 and 48 h， while caspase-3 activity was increased upon treatment with only 0.5 and 2.5 μg/100 μl of TEX-SEB after 24 h (p < 0.001). None of the concentrations of TEX-SEB affected the expression of the cancer-promoting genes. Our construct， the TEX-SEB， is a new model being able to create cytostatic properties on cancer cells.
Expression profiles of apoptotic genes induced by curcumin in human breast cancer and mammary epithelial cell lines.,Anticancer Res, 2005 Sep-Oct,16101141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16101141/,Curcumin (diferuloyl methane)， the yellow-colored dietary pigment from the rhizomes of turmeric， has been recognized as a chemopreventive agent because of its antitumor， antioxidant and antiproliferative effects. The cytotoxic， apoptotic and gene regulatory effects of both turmeric and curcumin were investigated in the MCF-7 human breast cancer carcinoma cell line and compared with the effects in MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells. MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to turmeric and curcumin than MCF-10A cells. MCF-10A cells retained comparatively less curcumin in the medium than MCF- 7 cells after 24 h， thereby reducing the cytotoxic effect. Curcumin induced a significantly higher percentage of apoptosis in MCF-7 than MCF-10A cells at all doses. Microarray hybridization of Clonetech apoptotic arrays with labeled first-strand probes of total RNA was performed to identify and characterize the genes regulated by curcumin in tumor cells. Of the 214 apoptosis-associated genes in the array， the expression of 104 genes was altered by curcumin treatment. The gene expression was altered up to 14-fold levels in MCF-7 as compared to only up to 1.5-fold in the MCF-10A cell line by curcumin. Curcumin up-regulated (>3 fold) 22 genes and down-regulated (<3-fold) 17 genes at both 25 microg/ml and 50 microg/ml doses in the MCF-7 cell line. The up-regulated genes include HIAP1， CRAF1， TRAF6， CASP1， CASP2， CASP3， CASP4， HPRT， GADD45， MCL-1， NIP1， BCL2L2， TRAP3， GSTP1， DAXX， PIG11， UBC， PIG3， PCNA， CDC10， JNK1 and RBP2. The down-regulated genes were TRAIL， TNFR， AP13， IGFBP3， SARP3， PKB， IGFBP， CASP7， CASP9， TNFSF6， TRICK2A， CAS， TRAIL-R2， RATS1， hTRIP， TNFb and TNFRSF5. While a dose-dependent gene expression change was noticed in some genes， opposite regulatory effects were induced by different curcumin doses in three apoptotic genes. These results suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells by regulation of multiple signaling pathways， indicating its potential use for prevention and treatment of cancer.
Identification of exosomal and non-exosomal microRNAs associated with the drug resistance of ovarian cancer.,Mol Med Rep, 2019 May,30864705,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864705/,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve important roles in drug‑resistance; however， exosomal miRNAs associated with drug‑resistance in ovarian cancer (OC) have not been reported to date. The current study aimed to analyze the drug resistance‑associated exosomal miRNAs in original OC cells and their derived exosomes using microarray data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (series GSE76449). The chemosensitive OC cell lines SKOV3_ip1， A2780_PAR and HEYA8， as well as the chemoresistant cell lines SKOV3_TR， A2780_CP20 and HEYA8_MDR， were investigated. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE‑miRNAs) were identified using the limma method， and their mRNA targets were predicted using the miRWalk and LinkedOmics database. Functions of target genes were analyzed with DAVID tool， while TCGA data were used to explore the survival association of identified miRNAs. According to the results， 28 DE‑miRNAs were found to be common in exosomal and original samples of A2780_CP20 cells， among which the functions of 5 miRNAs were predicted (including miR‑146b‑5p， miR‑509‑5p， miR‑574‑3p， miR‑574‑5p and miR‑760). In addition， 16 and 35 DE‑miRNAs were detected for HEYA8_MDR and SKOV3_TR， respectively， with the functions of 4 of these miRNAs predicted for each cell line (HEYA8_MDR: miR‑30a‑3p， miR‑30a‑5p， miR‑612 and miR‑617; SKOV3_TR: miR‑193a‑5p， miR‑423‑3p， miR‑769‑5p and miR‑922). It was also reported that miR‑183‑5p was the only one common miRNA among the three cell lines. Furthermore， miR‑574‑3p， miR‑30a‑5p and miR‑922 may regulate CUL2 to mediate HIF‑1 cancer signaling pathway， while miR‑183‑5p may modulate MECP2， similar to miR‑760， miR‑30a‑5p and miR‑922， to influence cell proliferation. Finally， the downregulated miR‑612 may promote the expression of TEAD3 via the Hippo signaling pathway， and this miRNA was associated with poor prognosis. In conclusion， the findings of the present study suggested several underlying miRNA targets for improving the chemotherapy sensitivity of OC.
MicroRNA 506 regulates expression of PPAR alpha in hydroxycamptothecin-resistant human colon cancer cells.,FEBS Lett, 2011 Nov 16,22036718,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22036718/,Chemotherapeutic drug resistance remains a major obstacle to the successful treatment of colon cancer. Here， we show that 77 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in SW1116/HCPT versus SW1116， and over-expressed miR-506 in SW1116/HCPT cells was validated. Then it was indicated that PPARα is a common target of miR-506 by using a luciferase reporter assay. Our results also demonstrated that cytotoxic ability of HCPT requires the concomitant presence of PPARα， and that loss of PPARα expression imparts resistance to HCPTs anti-tumor effects. All together， our studies indicate that miR-506 over-expression in established HCPT-resistant colon cancer cell line confers resistance to HCPT by inhibiting PPARα expression， then providing a rationale for the development of miRNA-based strategies for reversing resistance in HCPT-resistant colon cancer cells.
In vitro models for the study of the effect of butyrate on human colon adenocarcinoma cells.,Toxicol In Vitro, 2007 Mar,17084582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17084582/,The effect of butyrate has been analyzed on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines with different properties regarding tumorigenicity， differentiation and resistance to apoptosis induced by this agent. Butyrate reduces cell proliferation， induces differentiation (according to alkaline phosphatase activity) and apoptosis， being these effects time- and concentration-dependent. The susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of butyrate depends on the cell line considered and it is not directly related to tumorigenicity or differentiation. We show that 2mM butyrate treatment of non-tumorigenic BCS-TC2 cells for four days strongly influences the transcriptional activity， causing extensive modification in gene expression patterns (69 up-regulated and 109 down-regulated genes). Some of these genes are involved in the modulation of cell cycle progression， apoptosis and differentiation. We have analyzed the effect of butyrate in spontaneous or induced multicellular spheroids. The more stable spheroids (spontaneous or induced from butyrate-resistant cells) increase the resistance of cells to the effects of butyrate probably due to an impaired accessibility. This in vitro model could be useful to study the resistance of tumors to the effect of natural regulators (i.e. butyrate) as well as to develop and test new therapeutic approaches.
An integrative network inference approach to predict mechanisms of cancer chemoresistance.,Integr Biol (Camb), 2013 Mar,23340828,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23340828/,We present an integrative general network inference methodology to infer genetic and metabolic pathways associated with oncological drug chemoresistance. This methodology is general because it can infer different kinds of networks from different kinds of data. It is integrative because it integrates model simulation in its framework and it assembles into a larger integrated network all the inferred networks. The inference model is a variational approximation of Bayesian inference for stochastic processes. We used the Bayesian framework due to its ability to incorporate prior knowledge and constraints in the inference procedure and to treat both partial data and a large amount of data whose dynamics laws are mostly unknown. We show the performance of this approach using a case study of the gemcitabine chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Our method， inferred from time series data of gene expressions and metabolites， concentrates first the network of interactions of genes responsible for the sensitivity and resistance to gemcitabine， then the metabolic network， and finally it merges the two networks into a larger network predicting the correlations between genes and metabolizing enzymes.
Candidate genes for cross-resistance against DNA-damaging drugs.,Cancer Res, 2002 Nov 15,12438269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12438269/,Drug resistance of tumor cells leads to major drawbacks in the treatment of cancer. To identify candidate genes for drug resistance， we compared the expression patterns of the drug-sensitive human malignant melanoma cell line MeWo and three derived sublines with acquired resistance to the DNA-damaging agents cisplatin， etoposide， and fotemustine. Subarray analyses confirmed 57 candidate genes recovered from a genome-wide scan for differential expression. By specifically addressing cancer genes we retrieved another set of 209 candidates. Exemplary Northern blot studies indicated qualitative concordance for 110 of 135 (81.4%) data points. Whereas the etoposide-resistant line showed constant expression patterns over a period of approximately 2.5 years， the fotemustine- and cisplatin-resistant sublines exhibited considerable variability. Initially representing distinct entities， these two sublines finally converged in their expression patterns. A total of 110 genes was transiently or permanently deregulated in at least two resistant sublines. Fourteen genes displayed differential expression in all three of the sublines. We hypothesize that the variations in fotemustine and cisplatin resistance are based on progressive optimization and/or polyclonality. This， in addition to genomic alterations investigated by comparative genomic hybridization and evaluation of short-term response genes， can be used as a criterion for the selection of promising candidates. Among these are CYR61， AHCYL1， and MPP1， as well as several apoptosis-related genes， in particular STK17A and CRYAB. As MPP1 and CRYAB are also among the 14 genes differentially expressed in all three of the drug-resistant sublines， they represent the strongest candidates for resistance against DNA-damaging drugs.
Gene expression profiling of lung myofibroblasts reveals the anti-fibrotic effects of cyclosporine.,Tohoku J Exp Med, 2014 Aug,25132585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25132585/,Cyclosporine， a calcineurin inhibitor， is a potent immunosuppressive agent that acts chiefly through the inactivation of T-lymphocytes. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cyclosporine for treating fibrotic lung disease， but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that cyclosporine exerts direct effects against fibrogenesis of lung myofibroblasts， and aimed to elucidate the mechanism of this anti-fibrotic effect through gene-expression profiling using DNA microarray analysis. We found that cyclosporine suppressed the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen type I in myofibroblasts that had been differentiated from a fetal human lung fibroblast cell line by induction with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Furthermore， microarray analysis revealed that cyclosporine down-regulated 57 genes whose expression levels were increased by TGF-β， and up-regulated 73 genes， whose expression was decreased by TGF-β. Classifying these 57 down-regulated and 73 up-regulated genes with the Database for Annotation， Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) web tool， we have identified the involvement of several functional categories， including innate immunity， cytokine interaction， growth factor， and cancer pathway. Of the identified genes， we selected three fibrosis-related genes， insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2)， inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG)， and validated their expression patterns by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cyclosporine treatment decreased the expression levels of IGFBP2 and ID1， but increased PPARG expression. These results suggest that cyclosporine is a potent anti-fibrotic agent acting on myofibroblasts. Therefore， cyclosporine shows potential as a novel remedy for fibrotic lung disease.
Comparison of gene expression patterns among Leishmania braziliensis clinical isolates showing a different in vitro susceptibility to pentavalent antimony.,Parasitology, 2011 Feb,20678296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20678296/,Introduction:Evaluation of Leishmania drug susceptibility depends on in vitro Sb(V) susceptibility assays， which are labour-intensive and may give a biased view of the true parasite resistance. Molecular markers are urgently needed to improve and simplify the monitoring of Sb(V)-resistance. We analysed here the gene expression profile of 21 L. braziliensis clinical isolates in vitro defined as Sb(V)-resistant and -sensitive， in order to identify potential resistance markers.Methods:The differential expression of 13 genes involved in Sb(V) metabolism， oxidative stress or housekeeping functions was analysed during in vitro promastigote growth.Results:Expression profiles were up-regulated for 5 genes only， each time affecting a different set of isolates (mosaic picture of gene expression). Two genes， ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) and TRYR (trypanothione reductase)， showed a significantly higher expression rate in the group of Sb(V)-resistant compared to the group of Sb(V)-sensitive parasites (P<0.01). However， analysis of individual isolates showed both markers to explain only partially the drug resistance.Discussion:Our results might be explained by (i) the occurrence of a pleiotropic molecular mechanism leading to the in vitro Sb(V) resistance and/or (ii) the existence of different epi-phenotypes not revealed by the in vitro Sb(V) susceptibility assays， but interfering with the gene expression patterns.
Comprehensive analysis of microRNA-messenger RNA regulatory network in gemcitabine-resistant bladder cancer cells.,J Cell Biochem, 2019 Apr,30304549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30304549/,Chemotherapy is still a standard treatment of unresectable bladder cancer or distant metastases. The chemotherapy resistance always occurs after a period of treatment indicating poor prognosis. The current study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of chemoresistance in bladder cancer cells. The gene expression profiles of GSE77883， including three untreated T24 cells samples and three gemcitabine-resistant T24 cells samples， was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)， gene function analysis， and interaction prediction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and DEGs were performed by R software. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) and miRNA-DEGs networks were constructed and visualized by Cytoscape software. Then， the small molecules， with potential synergistic or antagonistic effects to gemcitabine resistance， were identified using the Connectivity Map database. Finally， gemcitabine-resistant T24 cell line was established and key genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In total， 536 upregulated and 513 downregulated genes were screened and mainly enriched in oxidative stress response and signaling pathways related to extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and focal adhesion. PPI network showed interleukin 6， tumor necrosis factor， kinesin family member 11， and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B were key genes. The miRNA-DEGs regulatory networks included 18 miRNAs and 185 DEGs， including miR-182-5p， miR-590-3p， miR-320a and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). Then， the related key genes and miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore， 81 small molecules with antagonistic or synergistic effect to GEM were screened. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms driving GEM-resistance in bladder cancer cells that would contribute to the development of chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer.Keywords:bladder cancer; differentially expressed genes; gemcitabine resistance; microRNA; small-molecule drugs.
Gene expression profiles and signaling mechanisms in alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor-evoked proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.,BMC Syst Biol, 2017 Jun 28,28659168,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28659168/,Background:α2-adrenoceptors are important regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. Regulation of cell proliferation is a less well investigated consequence of α2-adrenoceptor activation. We have previously shown that α2B-adrenoceptor activation stimulates proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). This may be important for blood vessel development and plasticity and for the pathology and therapeutics of cardiovascular disorders. The underlying cellular mechanisms have remained mostly unknown. This study explored pathways of regulation of gene expression and intracellular signaling related to α2B-adrenoceptor-evoked VSMC proliferation.Results:The cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways of α2B-adrenoceptor-evoked proliferation of VSMCs are complex and include redundancy. Functional enrichment analysis and pathway analysis identified differentially expressed genes associated with α2B-adrenoceptor-regulated VSMC proliferation. They included the upregulated genes Egr1， F3， Ptgs2 and Serpine1 and the downregulated genes Cx3cl1， Cav1， Rhoa， Nppb and Prrx1. The most highly upregulated gene， Lypd8， represents a novel finding in the VSMC context. Inhibitor library screening and kinase activity profiling were applied to identify kinases in the involved signaling pathways. Putative upstream kinases identified by two different screens included PKC， Raf-1， Src， the MAP kinases p38 and JNK and the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and HGF/HGFR. As a novel finding， the Src family kinase Lyn was also identified as a putative upstream kinase.Conclusions:α2B-adrenoceptors may mediate their pro-proliferative effects in VSMCs by promoting the activity of bFGF and PDGF and the growth factor receptors EGFR， HGFR and VEGFR-1/2. The Src family kinase Lyn was also identified as a putative upstream kinase. Lyn is known to be expressed in VSMCs and has been identified as an important regulator of GPCR trafficking and GPCR effects on cell proliferation. Identified Ser/Thr kinases included several PKC isoforms and the β-adrenoceptor kinases 1 and 2. Cross-talk between the signaling mechanisms involved in α2B-adrenoceptor-evoked VSMC proliferation thus appears to involve PKC activation， subsequent changes in gene expression， transactivation of EGFR， and modulation of kinase activities and growth factor-mediated signaling. While many of the identified individual signals were relatively small in terms of effect size， many of them were validated by combining pathway analysis and our integrated screening approach.Keywords:A7r5 cell line; Alpha2-adrenoceptor; DNA microarray; Functional analysis; Kinase activity profiling; Kinase inhibitor; Pathway analysis; Vascular smooth muscle cell.
Agreement between two large pan-cancer CRISPR-Cas9 gene dependency data sets.,Nat Commun, 2019 Dec 20,31862961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31862961/,Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 viability screens performed in cancer cell lines provide a systematic approach to identify cancer dependencies and new therapeutic targets. As multiple large-scale screens become available， a formal assessment of the reproducibility of these experiments becomes necessary. We analyze data from recently published pan-cancer CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed at the Broad and Sanger Institutes. Despite significant differences in experimental protocols and reagents， we find that the screen results are highly concordant across multiple metrics with both common and specific dependencies jointly identified across the two studies. Furthermore， robust biomarkers of gene dependency found in one data set are recovered in the other. Through further analysis and replication experiments at each institute， we show that batch effects are driven principally by two key experimental parameters: the reagent library and the assay length. These results indicate that the Broad and Sanger CRISPR-Cas9 viability screens yield robust and reproducible findings.
Significance and Function of MicroRNA-7 in Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,Anticancer Res, 2017 Mar,28314263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28314263/,Background/aim:We detected microRNA-7 (miR-7) as being specific for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by using database analysis. However， the significance of miR-7 in clinical ESCC remains unexplored. This study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological significance of miR-7 in ESCC， and investigate miR-7 function.Materials and methods:Quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate miR-7 expression in 85 ESCC samples to determine the clinicopathological significance of miR-7 expression. The regulation of proliferation by miR-7 was examined with miR-7 precursor-transfected cells.Results:The expression of miR-7 in ESCC was higher than that in normal tissues. Low expression levels of miR-7 were associated with poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that low miR-7 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival. In vitro assays showed miR-7 precursor treatment suppressed the proliferation of ESCC cells.Conclusion:miR-7 might be a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target in ESCC.Keywords:microRNA; oesophageal cancer; prognostic marker.
Glucocorticoids mediate transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation: Potential mechanistic and clinical implications.,Clin Transl Sci, 2022 Nov,36128656,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36128656/,lternative polyadenylation (APA) is a common genetic regulatory mechanism that generates distinct 3' ends for RNA transcripts. Changes in APA have been associated with multiple biological processes and disease phenotypes. However， the role of hormones and their drug analogs in APA remains largely unknown. In this study， we investigated transcriptome-wide the impact of glucocorticoids on APA in 30 human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. We found that glucocorticoids could regulate APA for a subset of genes， possibly by changing the expression of 142 RNA-binding proteins， some with known APA-regulating properties. Interestingly， genes with glucocorticoid-mediated APA were enriched in viral translation-related pathways， while genes with glucocorticoid-mediated expression were enriched in interferon and interleukin pathways， suggesting that glucocorticoid-mediated APA might result in functional consequences distinct from gene expression. For example， glucocorticoids， a pharmacotherapy for severe COVID-19， were found to change the APA but not the expression of LY6E， an important antiviral inhibitor in coronavirus diseases. Glucocorticoid-mediated APA was also cell-type-specific， suggesting an action of glucocorticoids that may be unique to immune regulation. We also observed evidence for genotype-dependent glucocorticoid-mediated APA (referred to as pharmacogenomic-alterative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci)， providing potential functional mechanisms for a series of common genetic variants that had previously been associated with immune disorders， but without a clear mechanism. In summary， this study reports a series of observations regarding the impact of glucocorticoids on APA， raising the possibility that this mechanism might have implications for both disease pathophysiology and drug therapy.
Hydroxycarbamide stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells: relevance to sickle cell disease.,Pharmacogenet Genomics, 2010 Apr,20216336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20216336/,Background and objective:The clinical hallmarks of sickle cell disease (SCD) are vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) triggered by red blood cells (RBC) stiffening and abnormal adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (VEC) in the context of chronic inflammation， cell activation， and vascular tone abnormalities. Hydroxycarbamide (HC) is the only drug with a proven efficacy in decreasing VOC frequency. HC decreases RBC stiffening， modulates adhesion protein expression by RBC and VEC， and reduces endothelin-1 production by VEC. Our objective was to test whether HC could also affect inflammation through its action on VEC.Methods:We used microarrays to study the effect of HC on the transcriptome of transformed human bone marrow endothelial cell， a cell line derived from bone marrow microcirculation (the predilection site of VOC)， in basal and proinflammatory conditions. Microarray results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and protein analysis on transformed human bone marrow endothelial cell (TrHBMEC) and on two other VEC types in the primary culture: human pulmonary microcirculation endothelial cell (HPMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC a classical model for the macrocirculation).Results:HC had a significant effect on the expression of genes of the 'inflammation pathway'. Strikingly， it stimulates the expression of proinflammatory genes such as IL1A， IL1B， IL6， IL8， CCL2， CCL5， CCL20， and CCL8 in all the tested VEC types.Conclusion:Our study confirms that VECs are significant targets of HC in the context of SCD and identifies its earlier unsuspected action on another major component of SCD pathophysiology， that is， the 'inflammation pathway'.
Enhanced in vitro invasiveness and drug resistance with altered gene expression patterns in a human lung carcinoma cell line after pulse selection with anticancer drugs.,Int J Cancer, 2004 Sep 10,15239124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15239124/,The human lung carcinoma cell line DLKP was exposed to sequential pulses of 10 commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs (VP-16， vincristine， taxotere， mitoxantrone， 5-fluorouracil， methotrexate， CCNU， BCNU， cisplatin and chlorambucil); resulting cell lines exhibited resistance to the selecting agents (ranging approx. 1.5- to 36-fold) and， in some cases， cross-resistance to methotrexate (approx. 1.4- to 22-fold)， vincristine (1.6- to 262-fold)， doxorubicin (Adriamycin， approx. 1.1- to 33-fold) and taxotere (approx. 1.1- to 36-fold). Several of the variants displayed collateral sensitivity to cisplatin. A marked increase in in vitro invasiveness and motility was observed with variants pulsed with mitoxantrone， 5-fluorouracil， methotrexate， BCNU， cisplatin and chlorambucil. There was no significant change in invasiveness of cells pulsed with VP-16， vincristine， taxotere or CCNU. All of the pulse-selected variants showed elevated levels of MDR-1/P-gp protein by Western blot analysis， although mdr-1 mRNA levels were not increased (except for DLKP-taxotere). In DLKP-taxotere， MRP1 protein levels were also greatly elevated， but mrp1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. BCRP was upregulated in DLKP-mitoxantrone at both the mRNA and protein levels. Gelatin zymography， Western blot and RT-PCR showed that DLKP and its variants secreted MMPs 2， 9 and 13. MMP inhibition assays suggested that MMP-2 plays a more important role than MMPs 9 and 13 in cell invasion of these DLKP drug-resistant variants in vitro. These results indicate that drug exposure may induce not only resistance but also invasiveness in cancer cells.
Association of a novel endometrial cancer biomarker panel with prognostic risk， platinum insensitivity， and targetable therapeutic options.,PLoS One, 2021 Jan 27,33503056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503056/,During the past decade， the age-adjusted mortality rate for endometrial cancer (EC) increased 1.9% annually with TP53 mutant (TP53-mu) EC disproportionally represented in advanced disease and deaths. Therefore， we aimed to assess pivotal molecular parameters that differentiate clinical outcomes in high- and low-risk EC. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas， we analyzed EC specimens with available DNA sequences and quantitative gene-specific RNA expression data. After polymerase ɛ (POLE)-mutant specimens were excluded， differential gene-specific mutations and mRNA expressions were annotated and integrated. Consequent to TP53-mu failure to induce p21， derepression of multiple oncogenes harboring promoter p21 repressive sites was observed， including CCNA2 and FOXM1 (P < .001 compared with TP53 wild type [TP53-wt]). TP53-wt EC with high CCNA2 expression (CCNA2-H) had a targeted transcriptomic profile similar to that of TP53-mu EC， suggesting CCNA2 is a seminal determinant for both TP53-wt and TP53-mu EC. CCNA2 enhances E2F1 function， upregulating FOXM1 and CIP2A， as observed in TP53-mu and CCNA2-H TP53-wt EC (P < .001). CIP2A inhibits protein phosphatase 2A， leading to AKT inactivation of GSK3β and restricted oncoprotein degradation; PPP2R1A and FBXW7 mutations yield similar results. Upregulation of FOXM1 and failed degradation of FOXM1 is evidenced by marked upregulation of multiple homologous recombination genes (P < .001). Integrating these molecular aberrations generated a molecular biomarker panel with significant prognostic discrimination (P = 5.8×10-7); adjusting for age， histology， grade， myometrial invasion， TP53 status， and stage， only CCNA2-H/E2F1-H (P = .0003)， FBXW7-mu/PPP2R1A-mu (P = .0002)， and stage (P = .017) were significant. The generated prognostic molecular classification system identifies dissimilar signaling aberrations potentially amenable to targetable therapeutic options.
Epigenomic profiling reveals novel and frequent targets of aberrant DNA methylation-mediated silencing in malignant glioma.,Cancer Res, 2006 Aug 1,16885346,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16885346/,Malignant glioma is the most common central nervous system tumor of adults and is associated with a significant degree of morbidity and mortality. Gliomas are highly invasive and respond poorly to conventional treatments. Gliomas， like other tumor types， arise from a complex and poorly understood sequence of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic alterations leading to gene silencing， in the form of aberrant CpG island promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation， have not been thoroughly investigated in brain tumors， and elucidating such changes is likely to enhance our understanding of their etiology and provide new treatment options. We used a combined approach of pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation， coupled with expression microarrays， to identify novel targets of epigenetic silencing in glioma cell lines. From this analysis， we identified >160 genes up-regulated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A treatment. Further characterization of 10 of these genes， including the putative metastasis suppressor CST6， the apoptosis-inducer BIK， and TSPYL5， whose function is unknown， revealed that they are frequent targets of epigenetic silencing in glioma cell lines and primary tumors and suppress glioma cell growth in culture. Furthermore， we show that other members of the TSPYL gene family are epigenetically silenced in gliomas and dissect the contribution of individual DNA methyltransferases to the aberrant promoter hypermethylation events. These studies， therefore， lay the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the full extent of epigenetic changes in gliomas and how they may be exploited for therapeutic purposes.
Functional annotation of IFN-alpha-stimulated gene expression profiles from sensitive and resistant renal cell carcinoma cell lines.,J Interferon Cytokine Res, 2006 Aug,16881864,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16881864/,The antiproliferative， antiviral， and immunomodulatory properties of interferons (IFNs) have led to its therapeutic implementation. IFNs effects are mediated by a complex network of signal transducers， culminating in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction. This complexity leads to diverse clinical responses to IFN， from no response to complete regression of disease. Elucidation of ISG induction patterns is， therefore， essential to understand and maximize its therapeutic potential. To correlate ISG expression profiles with IFN responsiveness， two renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines differing in antiviral and apoptotic response to IFN were treated with IFN-alpha for different times， and expression profiles were analyzed using a customized microarray containing 850 unique putative ISGs. Genes with similar kinetics of induction in both cell lines were clustered and analyzed for gene function. Seven sets of coordinately regulated genes were identified by k-means cluster analysis， and significant functional similarities were identified for five of the seven sets. Strikingly， expression of genes associated with transcription temporally preceded expression of those involved in signal transduction. Enhanced antiviral sensitivity to IFN was coincident with sustained expression of ISGs involved in transcriptional regulation. However， no difference in Stat1 activation was observed between the cell lines. Analysis of ISG expression patterns suggests that subtle differences in transcription profiles contribute to differences in IFN responsiveness.
Stress resistant human embryonic stem cells as a potential source for the identification of novel cancer stem cell markers.,Cancer Lett, 2010 Mar 28,19733430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19733430/,
Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA): a method for identifying associations between variable sets.,Bioinformatics, 2015 Jan 1,25183485,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25183485/,Motivation:Often during the analysis of biological data， it is of importance to interpret the correlation structure that exists between variables. Such correlations may reveal patterns of co-regulation that are indicative of biochemical pathways or common mechanisms of response to a related set of treatments. However， analyses of correlations are usually conducted by either subjective interpretation of the univariate covariance matrix or by applying multivariate modeling techniques， which do not take prior biological knowledge into account. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a simple method for objectively deciding whether a set of variables of known or suspected biological relevance， such as a gene set or pathway， is more prevalent in a set of variables of interest than we expect by chance. However， ORA is usually applied to a set of variables differentiating a single experimental variable and does not take into account correlations.Results:Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA) is a novel combination of ORA and correlation analysis that provides a means to test whether more associations exist between two specific groups of variables than expected by chance. The method is exemplified by application to drug sensitivity and microRNA expression data from a panel of cancer cell lines (NCI60). ORCA highlighted a previously reported correlation between sensitivity to alkylating anticancer agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. We also used this approach to validate microRNA clusters predicted by mRNA correlations. These observations suggest that ORCA has the potential to reveal novel insights from these data， which are not readily apparent using classical ORA.Availability and implementation:The R code of the method is available at https://github.com/ORCABioinfo/ORCAcode.
Drug repositioning based on gene expression data for human HER2-positive breast cancer.,Arch Biochem Biophys, 2021 Nov 15,34597657,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34597657/,Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer represents approximately 15-30% of all invasive breast cancers. Despite the recent advances in therapeutic practices of HER2 subtype， drug resistance and tumor recurrence still have remained as major problems. Drug discovery is a long and difficult process， so the aim of this study is to find potential new application for existing therapeutic agents. Gene expression data for breast invasive carcinoma were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The normal and tumor samples were analyzed using Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) R package in order to find the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These genes were used as entry for the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) L1000CDS2software and suggested 24 repurposed drugs. According to the obtained results， some of these drugs including vorinostat， mocetinostat， alvocidib， CGP-60474， BMS-387032， AT-7519， and curcumin have significant functional similarity and structural correlation with FDA-approved breast cancer drugs. Based on the drug-target network， which consisted of the repurposed drugs and their target genes， the aforementioned drugs had the highest degrees. Moreover， the experimental approach verified curcumin as an effective therapeutic agent for HER2 positive breast cancer. Hence， our work suggested that some repurposed drugs based on gene expression data can be noticed as potential drugs for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.Keywords:Breast cancer; Drug repositioning; Gene expression data; HER2-positive; The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modification reveals targets of aberrant promoter methylation in Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatr Blood Cancer, 2013 Sep,23508900,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23508900/,Background:Ewing sarcoma (ES)， a highly aggressive tumor of children and young adults， is characterized most commonly by an 11;22 chromosomal translocation that fuses EWSR1 located at 22q12 with FLI1， coding for a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. Although genetic changes in ES have been extensively researched， our understanding of the role of epigenetic modifications in this neoplasm is limited.Procedure:In an effort to improve our knowledge in the role of epigenetic changes in ES we evaluated the in vitro antineoplastic effect of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and identified epigenetically silenced genes by pharmacologic unmasking of DNA methylation coupled with genome-wide expression profiling.Results:Comparisons between untreated and 5-Aza-dC treated ES cell lines (n = 5) identified 208 probe sets with at least twofold difference in expression (P ≤ 0.05). The 208 probe sets represented 145 upregulated and 31 down-regulated genes. Of the 145 genes upregulated after 5-Aza-dC treatment， four: were further characterized. ACRC， CLU， MEST， and NNAT were found to be hypermethylated and transcriptionally down-regulated in ES cell lines. Further studies revealed that ACRC， CLU， MEST， and NNAT were often hypermethylated in primary ES tumors. Transfection-mediated reexpression of ACRC， CLU， MEST， and NNAT in ES cell lines resulted in decreased growth in culture.Conclusions:This study demonstrated epigenetically modified genes in ES cell lines and primary tumors and suggested that epigenetic dysregulation may contribute to disease pathogenesis in ES.Keywords:Ewing sarcoma; epigenetic modification; expression microarray.

Integral membrane protein 2A enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy via notch signaling pathway in cervical cancer.,Bioengineered, 2021 Dec,34872446,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872446/, the second most common cancer among women， cervical cancer is a huge threat to their health all over the world. Integral membrane protein 2A (ITM2A)， a member of the Type II Integral Membrane protein (ITM2) family， has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Moreover， the low expression of ITM2A was associated with cervical adenocarcinoma. However， the function of ITM2A in drug resistance in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here， we used bioinformatics methods to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) closely related to chemotherapeutic relapse cervical carcinoma. ITM2A is downregulated in cervical tumor tissues and is associated with poor survival. Furthermore， ITM2A is also downregulated in cervical cancer cells with cisplatin resistance. Overexpression of ITM2A increases the cisplatin sensitivity of cervical cancer cells. Mechanically， ITM2A upregulation mediates the sensitivity of cervical cancer cell through Notch signaling pathway. Our study suggests that ITM2A may serve as a target in mediating cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer.Keywords:Cervical cancer; ITM2A; Notch signaling pathway; chemotherapy; cisplatin; resistance.
MicroRNA-221/222 confers tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer by targeting p27Kip1.,J Biol Chem, 2008 Oct 31,18708351,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18708351/,We explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in acquiring resistance to tamoxifen， a drug successfully used to treat women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. miRNA microarray analysis of MCF-7 cell lines that are either sensitive (parental) or resistant (4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant (OHT(R))) to tamoxifen showed significant (>1.8-fold) up-regulation of eight miRNAs and marked down-regulation (>50%) of seven miRNAs in OHT(R) cells compared with parental MCF-7 cells. Increased expression of three of the most promising up-regulated (miR-221， miR-222， and miR-181) and down-regulated (miR-21， miR-342， and miR-489) miRNAs was validated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of miR-221 and miR-222 was also significantly (2-fold) elevated in HER2/neu-positive primary human breast cancer tissues that are known to be resistant to endocrine therapy compared with HER2/neu-negative tissue samples. Ectopic expression of miR-221/222 rendered the parental MCF-7 cells resistant to tamoxifen. The protein level of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1)， a known target of miR-221/222， was reduced by 50% in OHT(R) cells and by 28-50% in miR-221/222-overexpressing MCF-7 cells. Furthermore， overexpression of p27(Kip1) in the resistant OHT(R) cells caused enhanced cell death when exposed to tamoxifen. This is the first study demonstrating a relationship between miR-221/222 expression and HER2/neu overexpression in primary breast tumors that are generally resistant to tamoxifen therapy. This finding also provides the rationale for the application of altered expression of specific miRNAs as a predictive tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer marker.
Anti-proliferation effects of interferon-gamma on gastric cancer cells.,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2013,24175851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24175851/,IFN-γ plays an indirect anti-cancer role through the immune system but may have direct negative effects on cancer cells. It regulates the viability of gastric cancer cells， so we examined whether it affects their proliferation and how that might be brought about. We exposed AGS， HGC-27 and GES-1 gastric cancer cell lines to IFN-γ and found significantly reduced colony formation ability. Flow cytometry revealed no effect of IFN-γ on apoptosis of cell lines and no effect on cell aging as assessed by β-gal staining. Microarray assay revealed that IFN-γ changed the mRNA expression of genes related to the cell cycle and cell proliferation and migration， as well as chemokines and chemokine receptors， and immunity-related genes. Finally， flow cytometry revealed that IFN-γ arrested the cells in the G1/S phase. IFN-γ may slow proliferation of some gastric cancer cells by affecting the cell cycle to play a negative role in the development of gastric cancer.

Profiles of miRNAs matched to biology in aromatase inhibitor resistant breast cancer.,Oncotarget, 2016 Nov 1,27659519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27659519/,omatase inhibitor (AI) resistance during breast cancer treatment is mimicked by MCF-7:5C (5C) and MCF-7:2A (2A) cell lines that grow spontaneously. Survival signaling is reconfigured but cells are vulnerable to estradiol (E2)-inducible apoptosis. These model systems have alterations of stress related pathways including the accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum， oxidative， and inflammatory stress that occur prior to E2-induced apoptosis. We investigated miRNA expression profiles of 5C and 2A to characterize their AI resistance phenotypes. Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA2.0 arrays identified 184 miRNAs differentially expressed in 2A and 5C compared to E2-free wild-type MCF-7:WS8. In 5C， 34 miRNAs of the DLK1-DIO3 locus and miR-31 were overexpressed， whereas miR-222 was low. TCGA data revealed poor and favorable overall survival for low miR-31 and miR-222 levels， respectively (HR=3.0， 95% CI:1.9-4.8; HR=0.3， 95% CI:0.1-0.6). Targets of deregulated miRNAs were identified using CLIP-confirmed TargetScan predictions. KEGG enrichment analyses for 5C- and 2A-specific target gene sets revealed pathways associated with cell proliferation including insulin， mTOR， and ErbB signaling as well as immune response and metabolism. Key genes overrepresented in 5C- and 2A-specific pathway interaction networks including EGFR， IGF1R and PIK3R1 had lower protein levels in 5C compared to 2A and were found to be differentially modulated by respective miRNA sets. Distinct up-regulated miRNAs from the DLK1-DIO3 locus may cause these attenuative effects as they are predicted to interact with corresponding 3' untranslated regions. These new miRNA profiles become an important regulatory database to explore E2-induced apoptotic mechanisms of clinical relevance for the treatment of resistant breast cancer.Keywords:AI resistance; E2-inducible apoptosis; breast cancer; microRNA profiling; pathway enrichment.

Investigating the Molecular Processes behind the Cell-Specific Toxicity Response to Titanium Dioxide Nanobelts.,Int J Mol Sci, 2021 Aug 30,34502343,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34502343/,Some engineered nanomaterials incite toxicological effects， but the underlying molecular processes are understudied. The varied physicochemical properties cause different initial molecular interactions， complicating toxicological predictions. Gene expression data allow us to study the responses of genes and biological processes. Overrepresentation analysis identifies enriched biological processes using the experimental data but prompts broad results instead of detailed toxicological processes. We demonstrate a targeted filtering approach to compare public gene expression data for low and high exposure on three cell lines to titanium dioxide nanobelts. Our workflow finds cell and concentration-specific changes in affected pathways linked to four Gene Ontology terms (apoptosis， inflammation， DNA damage， and oxidative stress) to select pathways with a clear toxicity focus. We saw more differentially expressed genes at higher exposure， but our analysis identifies clear differences between the cell lines in affected processes. Colorectal adenocarcinoma cells showed resilience to both concentrations. Small airway epithelial cells displayed a cytotoxic response to the high concentration， but not as strongly as monocytic-like cells. The pathway-gene networks highlighted the gene overlap between altered toxicity-related pathways. The automated workflow is flexible and can focus on other biological processes by selecting other GO terms.Keywords:Caco-2/HT29-MTX; Gene Ontology; SAE; THP1; nanobelts; nanomaterials; overrepresentation analysis; titanium dioxide.

Differential miRNA expression profiles in human keratinocytes in response to protein kinase C inhibitor.,Mol Med Rep, 2017 Nov,28901412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28901412/,errant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is widely accepted to be involved in keratinocyte differentiation and to be dependent on activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. However， the miRNA profiles and biological characteristics of keratinocytes induced by specific inhibitors of PKC have yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the differential miRNA expression profiles in keratinocytes treated with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X， by conducting a bioinformatics analysis. Parts of the GF109203X‑induced keratinocytes formed distinct clones after 2 days of culture， and the expression of intergrin β1， cytokeratin (CK)19 and CK14 were positive， whereas CK10 expression was negative. A total of 79 miRNAs were differentially expressed in keratinocytes treated with GF109203X， among which 45 miRNAs were upregulated and 34 were downregulated. The significantly upregulated microRNAs includedhsa‑miR‑1‑3p and miR‑181c‑5p， whereas hsa‑miR‑31‑5p and hsa‑let‑7c‑3p were significantly downregulated. In addition， the results of reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction exhibited consistency with the microarray results. An enrichment analysis demonstrated that certain target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs serve an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation， cell cycle progression and apoptosis， etc. These results revealed that GF109203X induced the differential expression of certain miRNAs when keratinocytes began showing the characteristics of epidermal‑like stem cells， which may provide a novel approach for wound healing and regeneration of skin tissues.
Calcium channel blockers lercanidipine and amlodipine inhibit YY1/ERK/TGF-β mediated transcription and sensitize the gastric cancer cells to doxorubicin.,Toxicol In Vitro, 2021 Aug,33771646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33771646/,Elevated expression of YY1 is known to confer anti-apoptotic phenotype and hence is an attractive target for cancer therapeutics. In a repurpose screening， towards the identification of the inhibitors of YY1 regulated transcription in gastric cancer cells， the calcium channel blockers lercanidipine and amlodipine have been identified to inhibit YY1 more efficiently. We further probed these calcium channel blockers for their potential feature of alleviating the drug resistance in gastric cancer cells. Lercanidipine and amlodipine were found to show an enhanced effect with doxorubicin in inhibiting the growth of gastric cancer cells. While doxorubicin was identified to activate the pathways TGF-β and ERK/MAPK， lercanidipine was found to inhibit these pathways. This being the molecular mechanism behind the identified advantage of lercanidipine and amlodipine in sensitizing gastric cancer cells to doxorubicin. In multiple cellular models from different lineages， the cells with less sensitivity to doxorubicin were found to have the inherent activation of ERK/MAPK and TGF-β pathways. Also， we have identified that doxorubicin， in combination with any of the calcium channel blockers， could inhibit the potential of cellular proliferation and spheroid formation in gastric cancer cells. The current study shows the usefulness of lercanidipine and amlodipine for the targeted and combinatorial therapeutics of gastric cancer and specifically to improve the efficiency of doxorubicin.Keywords:Amlodipine (PubChem CID: 2162); Calcium channel blocker; Chemoresistance; Chemosensitivity; Doxorubicin (PubChem CID: 31703); Gastric cancer; Lercanidipine (PubChem CID: 65866); MTT formazan (PubChem CID: 16218671); Resazurin (PubChem CID: 11077); Signaling pathways.
Identifying differentially expressed genes and screening small molecule drugs for lapatinib-resistance of breast cancer by a bioinformatics strategy.,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2014,25605188,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25605188/,Background:Lapatinib， a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that interrupts the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2/neu pathways， has been indicated to have significant efficacy in treating HER2-positive breast cancer. However， acquired drug resistance has become a very serious clinical problem that hampers the use of this agent. In this study， we aimed to screen small molecule drugs that might reverse lapatinib-resistance of breast cancer by exploring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) via a bioinformatics method.Materials and methods:We downloaded the gene expression profile of BT474-J4 (acquired lapatinib-resistant) and BT474 (lapatinib-sensitive) cell lines from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using dChip software. Then， gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed with the DAVID database. Finally， a connectivity map was utilized for predicting potential chemicals that reverse lapatinib-resistance.Results:A total of 1， 657 DEGs were obtained. These DEGs were enriched in 10 pathways， including cell cycling， regulation of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion associate examples. In addition， several small molecules were screened as the potential therapeutic agents capable of overcoming lapatinib-resistance.Conclusions:The results of our analysis provided a novel strategy for investigating the mechanism of lapatinib-resistance and identifying potential small molecule drugs for breast cancer treatment.
Model cell culture system for defining the molecular and biochemical events mediating terminal differentiation of human melanoma cells.,J Cell Physiol, 2009 Feb,18844238,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18844238/,Cancer cells are commonly less differentiated than their normal progenitors; a phenotype that correlates with loss of specialized functions and an increased capability to self-renew. Melanoma is an ideal model to analyze cancer progression and differentiation since a well-characterized process of step-wise tumor progression has been defined. Our lab previously described a combinatorial in vitro treatment protocol to induce terminal differentiation of human melanoma cells using a low dose of the PKC activator Mezerein (Mez) combined with interferon-beta (IFN-beta)， which also activates IFN-stimulated gene expression in addition to the re-differentiation program. In principle， using an alternate way to induce terminal differentiation not including IFN-beta would be more compatible with gene expression profiling. A higher concentration of Mez alone induced terminal differentiation of HO-1 human melanoma cells as measured by morphological， growth and biochemical assays. Pre-treatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203x blocked changes associated with differentiation and inhibited the ability of Mez to force irreversible/terminal differentiation. By combining this efficient method of inducing terminal differentiation with microarray analyses we now identify potential regulators of this process and demonstrate utility of this novel in vitro model in which to study the molecular determinants and mechanisms of human melanoma differentiation.
Transcriptional Activation of Human GD3 Synthase (hST8Sia I) Gene in Curcumin-Induced Autophagy in A549 Human Lung Carcinoma Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2018 Jul 2,30004453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30004453/,Curcumin， a natural polyphenolic compound isolated from the plantCurcuma longa， is known to induce autophagy in various cancer cells， including lung cancer. In the present study， we also confirmed by LC3 immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses that curcumin triggers autophagy in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line. In parallel with autophagy induction， the gene expression of human GD3 synthase (hST8Sia I) responsible for ganglioside GD3 synthesis was markedly elevated in response to curcumin in the A549 cells. To investigate the transcriptional activation of hST8Sia I associated with the autophagy formation in curcumin-treated A549 cells， functional characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the hST8Sia I gene was carried out using the luciferase reporter assay system. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the -1146 to -646 region， which includes the putative c-Ets-1， CREB， AP-1， and NF-κB binding sites， functions as the curcumin-responsive promoter of hST8Sia I in A549 cells. The site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the NF-κB binding site at -731 to -722 was indispensable for the curcumin-induced hST8Sia I gene expression in A549 cells. Moreover， the transcriptional activation of hST8Sia I by the curcumin A549 cells was strongly inhibited by compound C， an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). These results suggest that curcumin controls hST8Sia I gene expression via AMPK signal pathway in A549 cells.Keywords:A549 cells; autophagic cell death; curcumin; human GD3 synthase (hST8Sia I); transcriptional regulation.
Functional cell surface expression of toll-like receptor 9 promotes cell proliferation and survival in human hepatocellular carcinomas.,Int J Oncol, 2010 Oct,20811701,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20811701/,Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a pattern-recognition receptor that is involved in immune signaling and plays a crucial role in cell survival through recognition of various bacterial and viral components including unmethylated CpG-DNA. TLR9 expression and function in cancer cells are not well understood. We investigated the expression of TLR9， and the function of TLR9 signaling， in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells following stimulation with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). Positive immunohistochemical staining for TLR9 was observed in 85.7% of HCC tissues. Western blot analysis revealed that TLR9 was expressed both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of HCC cell lines. Full-length TLR9 was predominantly expressed on the membrane rather than in the cytoplasm， whereas multiple cleaved forms of TLR9 were predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm rather than on the membrane. Cell surface stimulation of TLR9 promoted cell proliferation， and， furthermore， the TLR9 agonists， CpG-ODNs， reduced the cytotoxicity of the anti-cancer drug adriamycin (ADM) via up-regulation of apoptosis inhibitors such as survivin， Bcl-xL， XIAP and cFLIP， in HCC cell lines. Although cell surface stimulation of TLR9 did not activate either the NF-kappaB signaling pathway or the type-I IFN secretion pathway， gene chip microarray analysis indicated that TLR9 agonists closely regulated multiple oncology-related genes and transcription factors involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. In conclusion， our results indicate that functional cell surface expression of TLR9 in human HCC may play an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
The lincRNA MIRAT binds to IQGAP1 and modulates the MAPK pathway in NRAS mutant melanoma.,Sci Rep, 2018 Jul 19,30026510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30026510/,Despite major advances in targeted melanoma therapies， drug resistance limits their efficacy. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcriptome elements that do not encode proteins but are important regulatory molecules. LncRNAs have been implicated in cancer development and response to different therapeutics and are thus potential treatment targets; however， the majority of their functions and molecular interactions remain unexplored. In this study， we identify a novel cytoplasmic intergenic lincRNA (MIRAT)， which is upregulated following prolonged MAPK inhibition in NRAS mutant melanoma and modulates MAPK signaling by binding to the MEK scaffold protein IQGAP1. Collectively， our results present MIRAT's direct modulatory effect on the MAPK pathway and highlight the relevance of cytoplasmic lncRNAs as potential targets in drug resistant cancer.
ABCC2 (MRP2， cMOAT) can be localized in the nuclear membrane of ovarian carcinomas and correlates with resistance to cisplatin and clinical outcome.,Clin Cancer Res, 2006 Dec 1,17145840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17145840/,Purpose:Cisplatin resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. ABCC2 is commonly localized in apical cell membranes and could confer cisplatin resistance. Here， we show that ABCC2 can be localized in the cytoplasmic membrane as well as in the nuclear membrane of various human tissues including ovarian carcinoma cells.Experimental design:For the subcellular detection of ABCC2， immunohistochemistry was done using 41 Federation Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes stage III ovarian carcinoma specimens prepared before treatment with cisplatin-based schemes and 35 specimens from the same group after chemotherapy. Furthermore， 11 ovarian carcinoma cell lines as well as tissue microarrays consisting of various human tissues were analyzed.Results:Nuclear membranous localization of ABCC2 was associated with response to first-line chemotherapy at primary (P = 0.0013) and secondary surgery (P = 0.0060). Cases with relapse showed higher nuclear membrane expression at primary (P = 0.0003) and secondary surgery (P = 0.0024). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that weak nuclear membrane ABCC2 expression before treatment was associated with significantly longer overall (P = 0.04) and progression-free survival (P = 0.001); following chemotherapy， it correlated with significantly longer progression-free survival (P = 0.038). Tissue microarrays confirmed nuclear membranous localization of ABCC2， in particular， in poorly differentiated cells. In ovarian carcinoma cells， it correlated with resistance against cisplatin， whereas localization in the cytoplasmic membrane did not.Conclusions:ABCC2 confers resistance to cisplatin of ovarian carcinoma in cell culture systems and in clinics when expressed in the nuclear membrane. Thus， ABCC2 localization can predict platinum therapy outcome. Furthermore， expression of ABCC2 in nuclear membranes in human tissues is specific for poorly differentiated cells including stem cells.
Whole genome gene expression analysis reveals casiopeina-induced apoptosis pathways.,PLoS One, 2013,23382936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23382936/,Copper-based chemotherapeutic compounds Casiopeínas， have been presented as able to promote selective programmed cell death in cancer cells， thus being proper candidates for targeted cancer therapy. DNA fragmentation and apoptosis-in a process mediated by reactive oxygen species-for a number of tumor cells， have been argued to be the main mechanisms. However， a detailed functional mechanism (a model) is still to be defined and interrogated for a wide variety of cellular conditions before establishing settings and parameters needed for their wide clinical application. In order to shorten the gap in this respect， we present a model proposal centered in the role played by intrinsic (or mitochondrial) apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress caused by the chemotherapeutic agent. This model has been inferred based on genome wide expression profiling in cervix cancer (HeLa) cells， as well as statistical and computational tests， validated via functional experiments (both in the same HeLa cells and also in a Neuroblastoma model， the CHP-212 cell line) and assessed by means of data mining studies.
Changes in gene expression profile in two multidrug resistant cell lines derived from a same drug sensitive cell line.,Leuk Res, 2014 Aug,24996974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24996974/,Resistance to chemotherapy is one of the most relevant aspects of treatment failure in cancer. Cell lines are used as models to study resistance. We analyzed the transcriptional profile of two multidrug resistant (MDR) cell lines (Lucena 1 and FEPS) derived from the same drug-sensitive cell K562. Microarray data identified 130 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between K562 vs. Lucena 1， 1932 between K562 vs. FEPS， and 1211 between Lucena 1 versus FEPS. The NOTCH pathway was affected in FEPS with overexpression of NOTCH2 and HEY1. The highly overexpressed gene in MDR cell lines was ABCB1， and both presented the ABCB1 promoter unmethylated.Keywords:ABCB transporters; ABCB1; Cancer; MDR cell lines; Methylation; Multidrug resistance.
Cidofovir selectivity is based on the different response of normal and cancer cells to DNA damage.,BMC Med Genomics, 2013 May 23,23702334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23702334/,Background:Cidofovir (CDV) proved efficacious in treatment of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) hyperplasias. Antiproliferative effects of CDV have been associated with apoptosis induction， S-phase accumulation， and increased levels of tumor suppressor proteins. However， the molecular mechanisms for the selectivity and antitumor activity of CDV against HPV-transformed cells remain unexplained.Methods:We evaluated CDV drug metabolism and incorporation into cellular DNA， in addition to whole genome gene expression profiling by means of microarrays in two HPV(+) cervical carcinoma cells， HPV- immortalized keratinocytes， and normal keratinocytes.Results:Determination of the metabolism and drug incorporation of CDV into genomic DNA demonstrated a higher rate of drug incorporation in HPV(+) tumor cells and immortalized keratinocytes compared to normal keratinocytes. Gene expression profiling clearly showed distinct and specific drug effects in the cell types investigated. Although an effect on inflammatory response was seen in all cell types， different pathways were identified in normal keratinocytes compared to immortalized keratinocytes and HPV(+) tumor cells. Notably， Rho GTPase pathways， LXR/RXR pathways， and acute phase response signaling were exclusively activated in immortalized cells. CDV exposed normal keratinocytes displayed activated cell cycle regulation upon DNA damage signaling to allow DNA repair via homologous recombination， resulting in genomic stability and survival. Although CDV induced cell cycle arrest in HPV- immortalized cells， DNA repair was not activated in these cells. In contrast， HPV(+) cells lacked cell cycle regulation， leading to genomic instability and eventually apoptosis.Conclusions:Taken together， our data provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of CDV and its selectivity for HPV-transformed cells. The proposed mechanism suggests that this selectivity is based on the inability of HPV(+) cells to respond to DNA damage， rather than on a direct anti-HPV effect. Since cell cycle control is deregulated by the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 in HPV(+) cells， these cells are more susceptible to DNA damage than normal keratinocytes. Our findings underline the therapeutic potential of CDV for HPV-associated malignancies as well as other neoplasias.
Rigosertib induces cell death of a myelodysplastic syndrome-derived cell line by DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest.,Cancer Sci, 2015 Mar,25580850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25580850/," multi-kinase inhibitor， rigosertib (ON 01910.Na) has recently been highlighted as a novel type of anti-cancer agent for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)， but its action mechanisms remain to be clarified. We investigated the in vitro effects of rigosertib on an MDS-derived cell line MDS-L and a myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Rigosertib suppressed the proliferation of both HL-60 and MDS-L cells and induced apoptosis by inhibition of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. As the effects on cell cycle， rigosertib treatment promoted the phosphorylation of histone H2AX and led to the DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. In addition， an immunofluorescence staining study demonstrated the abnormal localization of aurora A kinase， suggesting that rigosertib causes perturbation of spindle assembly and deregulated mitotic patterns towards cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also found that rigosertib exerted growth inhibitory effects on two lymphoid cell lines， Jurkat and Ramos. We further examined the molecular pathways influenced by rigosertib from the gene expression profiling data of MDS-L cells and found a possible involvement of rigosertib treatment in the upregulation of the genes related to microtubule kinetics and the downregulation of the mRNA degradation system. The gene set enrichment analysis showed the suppression of ""nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)"" as the most significantly affected gene set. These data provide a new aspect and a potential utility of rigosertib for the treatment of refractory hematopoietic malignancies.Keywords:G2/M arrest; myelodysplastic syndromes; nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; rigosertib; synthetic anticancer agent."
BH3-only proteins Noxa， Bmf， and Bim are necessary for arsenic trioxide-induced cell death in myeloma.,Blood, 2008 May 15,18354037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18354037/,The use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat multiple myeloma (MM) is supported by preclinical studies as well as several phase 2 studies， but the precise mechanism(s) of action of ATO has not been completely elucidated. We used gene expression profiling to determine the regulation of apoptosis-related genes by ATO in 4 MM cell lines and then focused on Bcl-2 family genes. ATO induced up-regulation of 3 proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (Noxa， Bmf， and Puma) and down-regulation of 2 antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L). Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that Noxa and Puma bind Mcl-1 to release Bak and Bim within 6 hours of ATO addition. Bak and Bim are also released from Bcl-X(L). Silencing of Bmf， Noxa， and Bim significantly protected cells from ATO-induced apoptosis， while Puma silencing had no effect. Consistent with a role for Noxa inhibition of Mcl-1， the Bad-mimetic ABT-737 synergized with ATO in the killing of 2 MM lines. Finally， Noxa expression was enhanced by GSH depletion and inhibited by increasing GSH levels in the cells. Understanding the pattern of BH3-only protein response should aid in the rational design of arsenic-containing regimens.
Early Transcriptomic Response to OxLDL in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2020 Nov 21,33233417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33233417/,In the sub-retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) space of the aging macula， deposits of oxidized phospholipids， oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and associated oxidized low-density lipoproteins (OxLDL) are considered contributors to the onset and development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We investigated the gene expression response of a human-derived RPE cell line exposed for short periods of time to non-cytotoxic levels of OxLDL or LDL. In our cell model， treatment with OxLDL， but not LDL， generated an early gene expression response which affected more than 400 genes. Gene pathway analysis unveiled gene networks involved in the regulation of various cellular functions， including acute response to oxidative stress via up-regulation of antioxidative gene transcripts controlled by nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2)， and up-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-controlled detoxifying gene transcripts. In contrast， circadian rhythm-controlling genes and genes involved in lipid metabolism were strongly down-regulated. Treatment with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) did not induce the regulation of these pathways. These findings show that RPE cells are able to selectively respond to the oxidized forms of LDL via the up-regulation of gene pathways involved in molecular mechanisms that minimize cellular oxidative damage， and the down-regulation of the expression of genes that regulate the intracellular levels of lipids and lipid derivatives. The effect on genes that control the cellular circadian rhythm suggests that OxLDL might also disrupt the circadian clock-dependent phagocytic activity of the RPE. The data reveal a complex cellular response to a highly heterogeneous oxidative stress-causing agent such as OxLDL commonly present in drusen formations.Keywords:drusen; oxidative stress; oxidized LDL; retinal pigment epithelium; transcriptome.
Transcriptomic Signatures of Auger Electron Radioimmunotherapy Using Nuclear Targeting (111)In-Trastuzumab for Potential Combination Therapies.,Cancer Biother Radiopharm, 2015 Oct,26447839,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26447839/,(111)In-labeled trastuzumab modified with nuclear localizing signal (NLS) peptides ((111)In-trastuzumab-NLS) efficiently delivers an Auger electron (AE) emitter (111)In into the cell nucleus and is thus a promising radiopharmaceutical in AE radioimmunotherapy (AE-RIT) for targeted killing of HER2-positive cancer. However， further improvement of its therapeutic efficacy is required. In this study， the authors show a transcriptomic approach to identify potential targets for enhancing the cytotoxic effects of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS. They generated two types of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS harboring different numbers of NLS peptides， (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS-S and -L. These radioimmunoconjugates (230 and 460 kBq) showed a significant higher cytotoxicity to SKBR3 human breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 compared to (111)In-trastuzumab. Microarray analysis revealed that NF-kB-related genes (38 genes) were significantly changed in transcription by (111)In trastuzumab-NLS-L (230 kBq) treatment. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the microarray data by showing transcriptional alternation of selected NF-κB target genes in cells treated with (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS-L. Interestingly， bortezomib， a drug known as a NF-κB modulator， significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS-L in SKBR3 cells. Taken together， the transcriptome data suggest the possibility that the modulation of NF-kB signaling activity is a molecular signature of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS and coadministration of bortezomib may be efficacious in enhancement of AE-RIT with (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS.Keywords:Auger electron radioimmunotherapy; Bortezomib; DNA microarray; NF-κB.
Antimycotic drug discovery in the age of genomics.,Am J Pharmacogenomics, 2005,16336002,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16336002/,Genomic-based methodologies are increasingly used at all stages of drug development. The most extensive applications have occurred in early drug discovery stages due to advances in technologies that allow for automated synthesis and characterization of organic compounds， and for high-throughput screening of these molecules against known drug targets. The adaptation of genomic-based methodologies in later stages of drug development presents a more difficult task. In this review we describe how genomics can be used to identify previously uncharacterized pharmacologic actions that provide a basis for the development of new classes of antimycotic agents or for adverse event aversion. Clinically， novel antimycotics are gravely needed. This review provides a perspective on new technologies that will bridge the gap between drug discovery and development that may enable more rapid access to new antimycotic agents.
Systematic Characterization of DNA Methyltransferases Family in Tumor Progression and Antitumor Immunity.,Technol Cancer Res Treat, 2024 Jan-Dec,38847740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38847740/,Objective:DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic marker governed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)， which can influence cancer onset and progression. However， few studies have provided an integrated analysis of the relevance of DNMT family genes to cell stemness， the tumor microenvironment (TME)， and immunotherapy biomarkers across diverse cancers.Methods:This study investigated the impact of five DNMTs on transcriptional profiles， prognosis， and their association with Ki67 expression， epithelial-mesenchymal transition signatures， stemness scores， the TME， and immunological markers across 31 cancer types from recognized public databases.Results:The results indicated that DNMT1/DNMT3B/DNMT3A expression increased， whereas TRDMT1/DNMT3L expression decreased in most cancer types. DNMT family genes were identified as prognostic risk factors for numerous cancers， as well as being prominently associated with immune， stromal， and ESTIMATE scores， as well as with immune-infiltrating cell levels. Expression of the well-known immune checkpoints， PDCD1 and CILA4， was noticeably related to DNMT1/DNMT3A/DNMT3B expression. Finally， we validated the role of DNMT1 in MCF-7 and HepG2-C3A cell lines through its knockdown， whereafter a decrease in cell proliferation and migration ability in vitro was observed.Conclusion:Our study comprehensively expounded that DNMT family genes not only behave as promising prognostic factors but also have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy for various types of cancer.Keywords:DNMT family; immunomodulators; prognosis; tumor microenvironment; various cancers.
The strand separation and nuclease activities associated with YB-1 are dispensable for cisplatin resistance but overexpression of YB-1 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells generates several chemoresistance signatures.,Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 2008,18571458,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18571458/,YB-1 is a protein involved in DNA repair， transcription， splicing， translation， and confers cisplatin resistance in several cancers. However， it is unknown which YB-1 activity is required for this resistance. To identify the mechanism(s) by which nuclear YB-1 confers cisplatin resistance， we generated several YB-1 mutants and tested their impact on resistance in the mammary tumor cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. Transfection of wild type YB-1 bestowed cisplatin resistance in such cells but a mutant YB-1 with a point mutation at position 175 (YB-1(E175A)) did not. A truncated YB-1(1-205) increased cisplatin resistance above the levels conferred by wild type YB-1. The truncated YB-1(1-205) has intact nuclease activities but could not separate a DNA duplex containing a Y-box sequence (activities associated with DNA repair). Moreover， this truncated YB-1(1-205) did not alter splicing of the adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA minigene as it had low binding affinity for several splicing factors. In contrast， the mutant YB-1(E175A) protein behaved like wild type YB-1 regarding all these activities but yet did not confer cisplatin resistance. Finally， transfection of mutant YB-1(E175A) had low impact on overall transcription. The wild type and truncated YB-1(1-205) induced important but different alterations in gene expression as revealed by microarray analyses. Our results indicate that the splicing and the nuclease activities associated with YB-1 have minor impact on cisplatin resistance. In contrast， the global expression profiles displayed by both wild type and truncated YB-1(1-205) revealed several chemoresistance signatures which differed depending on the genetic status of the breast cancer cell line used.
Simplified ex-vivo drug evaluation in ocular surface cells: Culture on cellulose filters of cells obtained by impression cytology.,Exp Eye Res, 2021 Dec,34742691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34742691/,Drug development， resource- and time-intensive， extensively employs cell-based assays to assess the efficacy and safety of candidate drugs. The widely used immortalized cell lines， experimentally convenient， have limited predictive value. In contrast， ex-vivo models more faithfully reproduce diseases but are technically challenging to establish. To address this need， we developed a simplified process for ex-vivo cell culture， demonstrating its feasibility in ocular surface cells. Conjunctival cells were harvested by impression cytology and grown on mixed cellulose ester membrane filters (MCFs). Human and rabbit conjunctival cells cultured on MCFs are 100% viable at 24 h， and 43% viable at 72 h. A gene expression study evaluating 84 genes involved in ocular inflammation demonstrated that ex-vivo culturing maintains intact the expression of two thirds of these genes in human cells. That these cells are suitable for the assessment of ocular drugs was demonstrated by studying the effect of phosphosulindac (PS)， a small molecule under development for the treatment of dry eye disease， in both human and rabbit conjunctival cells. PS， for example， suppressed the expression of CXCL10， a cytokine participating in the pathogenesis of dry eye disease， in human and in rabbit conjunctival cells cultured ex-vivo by 32% and 70%， respectively. Conjunctival cells cultured ex-vivo can be transfected to evaluate mechanistic questions. We successfully transfected such cells with a plasmid expressing luciferase under the control of an IFN-γ-responsive promoter or its control plasmid. IFN-γ stimulated luciferase expression by 85% in cells with the responsive plasmid but not in controls; PS significantly suppressed this induction by 37% without affecting the control plasmid. These findings demonstrate that human and rabbit conjunctival cells cultured ex-vivo with our method are viable and maintain their biological integrity; respond to biological and pharmacological agents; and are transfectable with informative plasmids. The unique advantage of this method is to potentially accelerate the development of novel drugs for the treatment of ocular surface diseases， and to advance our understanding of ocular surface pathophysiology.Keywords:Conjunctiva; Drug development; Dry eye disease; Ex-vivo cell culture; Impression cytology; Ocular drugs; Phosphosulindac.
Metformin pharmacogenomics: a genome-wide association study to identify genetic and epigenetic biomarkers involved in metformin anticancer response using human lymphoblastoid cell lines.,Hum Mol Genet, 2016 Nov 1,28173075,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28173075/,Metformin is currently considered as a promising anticancer agent in addition to its anti-diabetic effect. To better individualize metformin therapy and explore novel molecular mechanisms in cancer treatment， we conducted a pharmacogenomic study using 266 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Metformin cytotoxicity assay was performed using the MTS assay. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed in LCLs using 1.3 million SNPs， 485k DNA methylation probes， 54k mRNA expression probe sets， and metformin cytotoxicity (IC50s). Top candidate genes were functionally validated using siRNA screening， followed by MTS assay in breast cancer cell lines. Further study of one top candidate， STUB1， was performed to elucidate the mechanisms by which STUB1 might contribute to metformin action. GWA analyses in LCLs identified 198 mRNA expression probe sets， 12 SNP loci， and 5 DNA methylation loci associated with metformin IC50 with P-values <10−4 or <10−5. Integrated SNP/methylation loci-expression-IC50 analyses found 3 SNP loci or 5 DNA methylation loci associated with metformin IC50 through trans-regulation of expression of 11 or 26 genes with P-value <10−4. Functional validation of top 61 candidate genes in 4 IPA networks indicated down regulation of 14 genes significantly altered metformin sensitivity in two breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase， STUB1， could influence metformin response by facilitating proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin A. GWAS using a genomic data-enriched LCL model system， together with functional and mechanistic studies using cancer cell lines， help us to identify novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers involved in metformin anticancer response.
Activation of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos by PLCZ cRNA injection.,Reproduction, 2009 Mar,19074500,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19074500/,The production of cloned animals by the transfer of a differentiated somatic cell into an enucleated oocyte circumvents fertilization. During fertilization， the sperm delivers a sperm-specific phospholipase C (PLCZ) that is responsible for triggering Ca(2)(+) oscillations and oocyte activation. During bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)， oocyte activation is artificially achieved by combined chemical treatments that induce a monotonic rise in intracellular Ca(2)(+) and inhibit either phosphorylation or protein synthesis. In this study， we tested the hypothesis that activation of bovine nuclear transfer embryos by PLCZ improves nuclear reprogramming. Injection of PLCZ cRNA into bovine SCNT units induced Ca(2)(+) oscillations similar to those observed after fertilization and supported high rates of blastocyst development similar to that seen in embryos produced by IVF. Furthermore， gene expression analysis at the eight-cell and blastocyst stages revealed a similar expression pattern for a number of genes in both groups of embryos. Lastly， levels of trimethylated lysine 27 at histone H3 in blastocysts were higher in bovine nuclear transfer embryos activated using cycloheximide and 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP) than in those activated using PLCZ or derived from IVF. These results demonstrate that exogenous PLCZ can be used to activate bovine SCNT-derived embryos and support the hypothesis that a fertilization-like activation response can enhance some aspects of nuclear reprogramming.
Statins as regulators of redox state in the vascular endothelium: beyond lipid lowering.,Antioxid Redox Signal, 2014 Mar 10,24111702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24111702/,Significance:Endothelial dysfunction and the imbalance between nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species production in the vascular endothelium are important early steps in atherogenesis， a major socioeconomic health problem. Statins have well-established roles in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD)， due to both their lipid-lowering capacity and their pleiotropic properties. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms by which statins can modify endothelial function and affect atherogenesis.Recent advances:In the last decade， the concept of statin pleiotropy has been reinforced by a large number of cell culture， animal， and translational studies. Statins have been shown to suppress the activity of pro-oxidant enzymes (such as NADPH oxidase) and pro-inflammatory transcriptional pathways in the endothelium. At the same time， they enhance endothelial NO synthase expression and activity while they also improve its enzymatic coupling. This leads to increased NO bioavailability and improved endothelial function.Critical issues:Despite significant recent advances， the exact mechanisms of statin pleitropy are still only partially understood. The vast majority of the published literature relies on animal studies， while the actual mechanistic studies in humans are limited.Future directions:The success of statins as endothelium redox-modifying agents with a direct impact on clinical outcome highlights the importance of the endothelium as a therapeutic target in CVD. Better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie endothelial dysfunction could lead to the design of novel therapeutic strategies that target the vascular endothelium for the prevention and treatment of CVD.
Targeting glycometabolic reprogramming to restore the sensitivity of leukemia drug-resistant K562/ADM cells to adriamycin.,Life Sci, 2018 Dec 15,30473023,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30473023/,ims:Mounting studies have confirmed that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism during early carcinogenesis to develop many other hallmarks， and demonstrated a relationship between aerobic glycolysis and the occurrence of drug resistance. However， the molecular mechanisms and role in tumor drug resistance of aerobic glycolysis remain unclear.Main methods:We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the RNA level between the multi-drug resistance (MDR) leukemia cell line K562/adriamycin (ADM) and its parental， drug-sensitive K562 cell line. Clustering and enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed. Oxamate， a lactic dehydrogenase inhibitor were used to assess the effect of glycolysis inhibition on ADM susceptibility and the expression of the enriched DEGs in K562/ADM cells.Key findings:A total of 1742 DEGs were detected between the K562/ADM and K562 cell lines. The differential expression of unigenes encoding enzymes involved in glycometabolism signifies that there was a greater aerobic glycolysis flux in K562/ADM cells. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway， which is related to glucose metabolism， showed representative differential enrichment and up-regulation in K562/ADM cells. Oxamate improved and re-sensitized the therapeutic effect of ADM in ADM-resistant cells by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis either directly or indirectly by down-regulation of the AKT-mTOR pathway.Significance:Our findings suggest that ADM resistance mediated by the increase of aerobic glycolysis， which related to the over-activation of the AKT-mTOR-c-Myc pathway in MDR leukemia cells. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis and down-regulation of signaling pathways involved in aerobic glycolysis represent a potential chemotherapeutic strategy for sensitizing leukemic cells and thereby overcoming MDR.Keywords:Aerobic glycolysis; Glycolysis inhibitor; Glycometabolic reprogramming; Leukemia; Multi-drug resistance.
Gene expression profile of primary prostate epithelial and stromal cells in response to sulforaphane or iberin exposure.,Prostate, 2009 Sep 15,19489030,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19489030/,Background:Broccoli consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) derived from glucosinolates that accumulate in broccoli are dietary compounds that may mediate these health effects. Sulforaphane (SF， 4-methylsulphinylbutyl ITC) derives from heading broccoli (calabrese) and iberin (IB， 3-methylsulphinypropyl ITC) from sprouting broccoli. While there are many studies regarding the biological activity of SF， mainly undertaken with cancerous cells， there are few studies associated with IB.Methods:Primary epithelial and stromal cells were derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 whole genome arrays were used to compare global gene expression between these cells， and to quantify changes in gene expression following exposure to physiologically appropriate concentrations of SF and IB. Ontology and pathway analyses were used to interpret results. Changes in expression of a subset of genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.Results:Global gene expression profiling identified epithelial and stromal-specific gene expression profiles. SF induced more changes in epithelial cells， whereas IB was more effective in stromal cells. Although IB and SF induced different changes in gene expression in both epithelial and stromal cells， these were associated with similar pathways， such as cell cycle and detoxification. Both ITCs increased expression of PLAGL1， a tumor suppressor gene， in stromal cells and suppressed expression of the putative tumor promoting genes IFITM1， CSPG2， and VIM in epithelial cells.Conclusion:These data suggest that IB and SF both alter genes associated with cancer prevention， and IB should be investigated further as a potential chemopreventative agent.

Validation of a quantitative flow cytometer assay for monitoring HER-2/neu expression level in cell-based cancer immunotherapy products.,Biologicals, 2010 Mar,20080049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20080049/,GVAX immunotherapy for prostate cancer is comprised of two genetically modified prostate cancer cell lines， CG1940 and CG8711， engineered to secrete granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. As part of the matrix of potency assays， CG1940 and CG8711 are tested for the expression level of cell surface HER-2/neu using a quantitative flow cytometer assay. This assay reports the antibody binding capacity value of the cells as a measure of HER-2/neu expression using cells immediately after thawing from cryogenic storage. With optimized cell handling and staining procedure and appropriate system suitability controls， the assay was validated as a quantitative assay. The validation results showed that assay accuracy， specificity， precision， linearity， and range were suitable for the intended use of ensuring lot-to-lot consistency of HER-2/neu expression. Assay robustness was demonstrated using design of experiments that evaluated critical assay parameters. Finally， the assay was successfully transferred to a current good manufacturing practice Quality Control laboratory in a separate facility. Since the overall precision of this assay is better than that of ELISA methods and it can be performed with ease and high throughput， quantitative flow cytometer-based assays may be an appropriate immunological assay platform for Quality Control laboratories for characterization and release of cell-based therapies.
Network-based analysis of calcium-binding protein genes identifies Grp94 as a target in human oral carcinogenesis.,Br J Cancer, 2007 Sep 17,17726464,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17726464/,To characterise Ca(2+) -binding protein gene expression changes in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs)， we compared the gene expression profiles in OSCC-derived cell lines with normal oral tissues. One hundred Ca(2+) -binding protein genes differentially expressed in OSCCs were identified， and genetic pathways associated with expression changes were generated. Among genes mapped to the network with the highest significance， glucose-regulated protein 94 kDa (Grp94) was evaluated further for mRNA and protein expression in the OSCC cell lines， primary OSCCs， and oral premalignant lesions (OPLs). A significant (P<0.001) overexpression of Grp94 protein was observed in all cell lines compared to normal oral epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis showed highly expressed Grp94 in primary OSCCs and OPLs， whereas most of the corresponding normal tissues had no protein immunoreaction. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR data agreed with the protein expression status. Moreover， overexpression of Grp94 in primary tumours was significantly (P<0.001) correlated with poor disease-free survival. The results suggested that Grp94 may have potential clinical application as a novel diagnosis and prognostic biomarker for human OSCCs.
Silencing expression of UO-44 (CUZD1) using small interfering RNA sensitizes human ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin in vitro.,Oncogene, 2007 Feb 8,16862170,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16862170/,Ovarian cancer is currently the second leading cause of gynecological malignancy and cisplatin or cisplatin-based regimens have been the standard of care for the treatment of advance epithelial ovarian cancers. However， the efficacy of cisplatin treatment is often limited by the development of drug resistance either through the inhibition of apoptotic genes or activation of antiapoptotic genes. We have previously reported the overexpression of human UO-44 (HuUO-44) in ovarian cancers and the HuUO-44 antisera markedly inhibited NIH-OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell attachment and proliferation (Oncogene 23: 5707-5718， 2004). In the present study， we observed through the cancer cell line profiling array that the expression of HuUO-44 was suppressed in the ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3) after treatment with several chemotherapeutic drugs. Similarly， this suppression in HuUO-44 expression was also correlated to the cisplatin sensitivity in two other ovarian cancer cell lines NIH-OVCAR3 and OV-90 in a dose-dependent manner. To elucidate the function of HuUO-44 in cisplatin chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cell， small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were employed to mediate HuUO-44 silencing in ovarian cancer cell line， NIH-OVCAR3. HuUO-44 RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. Importantly， HuUO-44 RNAi significantly increased sensitivity of NIH-OVCAR3 to cytotoxic stress induced by cisplatin (P<0.01). Strikingly， we have also demonstrated that overexpression of HuUO-44 significantly conferred cisplatin resistance in NIH-OVCAR3 cells (P<0.05). Taken together， UO-44 is involved in conferring cisplatin resistance; the described HuUO-44-specific siRNA oligonucleotides that can potently silence HuUO-44 gene expression may prove to be valuable pretreatment targets for antitumor therapy or other pathological conditions that involves aberrant HuUO-44 expression.

Altered miRNA and gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype identify networks of prognostic relevance.,Leukemia, 2013 Feb,22810507,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22810507/,Recently， the p53-miR-34a network has been identified to have an important role in tumorigenesis. As in acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype (CK-AML) TP53 alterations are the most common known molecular lesion， we further analyzed the p53-miR-34a axis in a large cohort of CK-AML with known TP53 status (TP53(altered)， n=57; TP53(unaltered)， n=31; altered indicates loss and/or mutation of TP53). Profiling microRNA (miRNA) expression delineated TP53 alteration-associated miRNA profiles， and identified miR-34a and miR-100 as the most significantly down- and upregulated miRNA， respectively. Moreover， we found a distinct miR-34a expression-linked gene expression profile enriched for genes belonging to p53-associated pathways， and implicated in cell cycle progression or apoptosis. Clinically， low miR-34a expression and TP53 alterations predicted for chemotherapy resistance and inferior outcome. Notably， in TP53(unaltered) CK-AML， high miR-34a expression predicted for inferior overall survival (OS)， whereas in TP53(biallelic altered) CK-AML， high miR-34a expression pointed to better OS. Thus， detailed molecular profiling links impaired p53 to decreased miR-34a expression， but also identifies p53-independent miR-34a induction mechanisms as shown in TP53(biallelic altered) cell lines treated with 15-deoxy-Δ(12，14)-prostaglandin. An improved understanding of this mechanism might provide novel therapeutic options to restore miR-34a function and thereby induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in TP53(altered) CK-AML.

The Moringin/alpha-CD Pretreatment Induces Neuroprotection in an In Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease: A Transcriptomic Study.,Curr Issues Mol Biol, 2021 May 26,34073287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34073287/,lzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the most common form of senile dementia. Autophagy and mitophagy are cellular processes that play a key role in the aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau phosphorylation. As a consequence， impairment of these processes leads to the progression of AD. Thus， interest is growing in the search for new natural compounds， such as Moringin (MOR)， with neuroprotective， anti-amyloidogenic， antioxidative， and anti-inflammatory properties that could be used for AD prevention. However， MOR appears to be poorly soluble and stable in water. To increase its solubility MOR was conjugated with α-cyclodextrin (MOR/α-CD). In this work， it was evaluated if MOR/α-CD pretreatment was able to exert neuroprotective effects in an AD in vitro model through the evaluation of the transcriptional profile by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To induce the AD model， retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to Aβ1-42. The MOR/α-CD pretreatment reduced the expression of the genes which encode proteins involved in senescence， autophagy， and mitophagy processes. Additionally， MOR/α-CD was able to induce neuronal remodeling modulating the axon guidance， principally downregulating the Slit/Robo signaling pathway. Noteworthy， MOR/α-CD， modulating these important pathways， may induce neuronal protection against Aβ1-42toxicity as demonstrated also by the reduction of cleaved caspase 3. These data indicated that MOR/α-CD could attenuate the progression of the disease and promote neuronal repair.Keywords:Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid β-peptide; in vitro study; moringin/α-CD complex; transcriptomic analysis.
Identification of BIRC6 as a novel intervention target for neuroblastoma therapy.,BMC Cancer, 2012 Jul 12,22788920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22788920/,Background:Neuroblastoma are pediatric tumors of the sympathetic nervous system with a poor prognosis. Apoptosis is often deregulated in cancer cells， but only a few defects in apoptotic routes have been identified in neuroblastoma.Methods:Here we investigated genomic aberrations affecting genes of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in neuroblastoma. We analyzed DNA profiling data (CGH and SNP arrays) and mRNA expression data of 31 genes of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dataset of 88 neuroblastoma tumors using the R2 bioinformatic platform ( http://r2.amc.nl). BIRC6 was selected for further analysis as a tumor driving gene. Knockdown experiments were performed using BIRC6 lentiviral shRNA and phenotype responses were analyzed by Western blot and MTT-assays. In addition， DIABLO levels and interactions were investigated with immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation.Results:We observed frequent gain of the BIRC6 gene on chromosome 2， which resulted in increased mRNA expression. BIRC6 is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)， that can bind and degrade the cytoplasmic fraction of the pro-apoptotic protein DIABLO. DIABLO mRNA expression was exceptionally high in neuroblastoma but the protein was only detected in the mitochondria. Upon silencing of BIRC6 by shRNA， DIABLO protein levels increased and cells went into apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed direct interaction between DIABLO and BIRC6 in neuroblastoma cell lines.Conclusion:Our findings indicate that BIRC6 may have a potential oncogenic role in neuroblastoma by inactivating cytoplasmic DIABLO. BIRC6 inhibition may therefore provide a means for therapeutic intervention in neuroblastoma.

Effects of Ganoderma lucidum (Higher Basidiomycetes) Extracts on the miRNA Profile and Telomerase Activity of the MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cell Line.,Int J Med Mushrooms, 2015,25954907,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25954907/,Ganoderma lucidum is a medicinal higher Basidiomycetes mushroom that exerts anticancer effects through several different mechanisms. This study investigated the effects of G. lucidum on the telomerase activity and microRNA (miRNA) profiles of MCF-7 cells. According to the cytotoxicity results， the G. lucidum ether extract exhibits the highest cytotoxic potency; therefore it was chosen for the subsequent telomerase activity assay and miRNA profiling. The telomerase activity observed in the cells treated with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of G. lucidum ether extract (100 µg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide) was 32.2% lower than that of the control cells treated with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Among 1066 miRNAs， the most downregulated miRNA was hsa-miR-27a* (4.469-fold)， and the most upregulated miRNA was hsa-miR-1285 (10.462-fold). A database search revealed the predicted miRNAs that target the catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme telomerase reverse transcriptase， and only miR-3687 (upregulated 2.153-fold) and miR-1207-5p (upregulated 2.895-fold) were changed by at least 2-fold. The miRNA profile changes demonstrated in this study provide a data set regarding their effects on the pathways that regulate telomerase activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with G. lucidum. These data should aid the development of novel cancer treatment strategies.

Function and expression differences between ergot and non-ergot dopamine D2 agonists on heart valve interstitial cells.,J Heart Valve Dis, 2014 Mar,25076559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25076559/,Background and aim of the study:The symptoms of Parkinson's disease are alleviated by dopamine D2 agonists， which are classified as ergot dopamine D2 agonists and non-ergot D2 agonists. Among the former， pergolide has been associated with valvular heart disease， since it has both potent D2 receptor and serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptor agonistic properties. Among the latter， pramipexole has few incidences of heart valve disease onset， since it has an absence of 5-HT(2B) receptor agonism.Method:A [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was performed to monitor function， and microarray global analysis to monitor gene expression， on porcine heart valve interstitial cells (VICs) treated with pergolide or pramipexole.Results:The 5-HT(2B) receptor was abundantly expressed in porcine VICs. The 5-HT(2B) receptor agonist pergolide induced an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation， accompanied by a decrease in 5-HT(2B) receptor mRNA expression. [3H]thymidine incorporation was blocked by lisuride， a 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonist， and also by LY-294002， a specific inhibitor of PI3K and Akt. Moreover， type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) expression in porcine VICs treated with pergolide was shown， by a global analysis of mRNA， to be markedly increased compared to that induced by pramipexole. Such changes in VICs may correlate with the mechanism of heart valve disease pathogenesis.Conclusion:There were substantial differences (increased [3H]thymidine incorporation， and Dio2 expression) between pergolide and pramipexole， which might correlate with the mechanism of heart valve disease onset.
BET inhibitors combined with chemotherapy synergistically inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells.,Oncol Rep, 2021 May,33760217,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33760217/,The bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain (BET) family proteins are essential epigenetic regulators in lung cancer. However， BET inhibitors have not had the anticipated therapeutic efficacy. Combined treatment using BET inhibitors along with other drugs had favorable therapeutic effects but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antineoplastic effects and mechanisms of a combination of a BET inhibitor and paclitaxel or cisplatin in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). By using the online Kaplan‑Meier plotter， it was revealed that increased mRNA levels of several BET protein‑coding genes were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC. SRB assay results revealed that pharmaceutical or genetic targeting of BET proteins suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells. Inhibition of BET protein expression， in combination with the use of chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel and cisplatin， further restrained NSCLC cell growth in a synergistic manner. Mechanistically， this combination of suppression of BET expression and chemotherapeutic treatment blocked NSCLC cell growth by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis， which were revealed by both western blot and ELISA results. The present findings revealed a new rationale for using a combination of BET inhibitors with chemotherapy in NSCLC treatment.Keywords:non‑small cell lung cancer; bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain; chemotherapy; autophagy; apoptosis.
ANXA1Ac2-26 peptide， a possible therapeutic approach in inflammatory ocular diseases.,Gene, 2017 May 30,28257834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257834/,The eye is immunologically privileged when inflammatory responses are suppressed. One component responsible for the suppression of inflammatory responses is the blood retinal barrier， which comprises the retinal pigment epithelium. The destruction of this barrier initiates inflammation， which can affect any part of the eye. Therefore， inflammatory response is controlled by the action of anti-inflammatory mediators， among these mediators， annexin A1 (ANXA1) protein acts as a modulator of inflammation. In this study we aimed to improve the knowledge of this area by investigating how a peptide of the ANXA1 protein (ANXA1Ac2-26) modulates the morphology， proliferation， migration and expression of genes and proteins in human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19). Determining how signaling pathways (NF-κB and UBC) are modulated by the ANXA1Ac2-26peptide could be important for understanding the inflammatory process. ARPE-19 cells were activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) and treated with ANXA1Ac2-26peptide， in a concentration of 1.7μM and 33.8μM. We observed that the LPS activation diminished the levels of endogenous ANXA1 after 2h and 24h and ANXA1Ac2-26peptide decreased the proliferation and re-establishes the migration of ARPE-19 cells. After using a hybridization approach， 80 differentially expressed genes were found. Five of these genes were selected (LRAT， CTGF， MAP1B， ALDH1A3 and SETD7) and all were down-regulated after treatment with the peptide. The genes CTGF and LRAT would be considered as potential molecular markers of ophthalmologic inflammation. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also decreased after the treatment， indicating the efficiency of the anti-inflammatory peptide at high concentrations， since the reduction in the levels of these mediators were observed after the treatment with ANXA1Ac2-26peptide at 33.8μM. Our results suggest that the retinal pigment epithelial cells are a potential target of the ANXA1 protein and point to possible applications of the ANXA1Ac2-26peptide as an innovative therapy for the treatment of ocular inflammation.
Arsenic trioxide Alters the MicroRNA Expression Profile of U87 glioblastoma.,Anticancer Agents Med Chem, 2015,26118712,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26118712/,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a major role in cancer pathogenesis， cells growth and apoptosis. We studied the dysregulation of miRNAs after the induction of apoptosis by 4 μM dose of ATO in glioblastoma cell line， U87. The anticancer effect of ATO was verified using MTT， BrdU cell proliferation assay and flow cytometric analysis. Differential expressions of 88 cancer-related miRNAs were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR using miRNA PCR cancer-array system. The fold changes of miRNAs were calculated by comparing the results of treated to untreated control. Among the 88 cancer-related miRNAs， 2-fold upregulation was detected in 26 miRNAs and downregulation in 10 miRNAs compared to the control. The role of some of the miRNAs with significant changes was investigated by searching the literature and studying their roles in apoptosis， cell cycle and in various cellular signalling pathways. Our results showed that ATO modified the expression of a significant number of cancer-related miRNAs in glioblastoma cell line; most of these especially the upregulated miRNAs， were known as tumor suppressors with extensive roles in cancer associated processes and pathways. This study supports the mediatory role of miRNAs in anticancer effect of ATO.
Activities of multiple cancer-related pathways are associated with BRAF mutation and predict the resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors in melanoma cells.,Cell Cycle, 2014,24200969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24200969/,Drug resistance is a major obstacle in the targeted therapy of melanoma using BRAF/MEK inhibitors. This study was to identify BRAF V600E-associated oncogenic pathways that predict resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We took in silico approaches to analyze the activities of 24 cancer-related pathways in melanoma cells and identify those whose activation was associated with BRAF V600E and used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We then experimentally confirmed the in silico findings. In a microarray gene expression dataset of 63 melanoma cell lines， we found that activation of multiple oncogenic pathways preferentially occurred in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. This finding was reproduced in 5 additional independent melanoma datasets. Further analysis of 46 melanoma cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation showed that 7 pathways， including TNFα， EGFR， IFNα， hypoxia， IFNγ， STAT3， and MYC， were significantly differently expressed in AZD6244-resistant compared with responsive melanoma cells. A SVM classifier built on this 7-pathway activation pattern correctly predicted the response of 10 BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in our experiments. We experimentally showed that TNFα， EGFR， IFNα， and IFNγ pathway activities were also upregulated in melanoma cell A375 compared with its sub-line DRO， while DRO was much more sensitive to AZD6244 than A375. In conclusion， we have identified specific oncogenic pathways preferentially activated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells and a pathway pattern that predicts resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors， providing novel clinical implications for melanoma therapy.Keywords:BRAF V600E inhibitor; BRAF mutation; MEK inhibitor; drug resistance; melanoma; oncogenic pathway.
HERG K+ channel expression-related chemosensitivity in cancer cells and its modulation by erythromycin.,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol, 2005 Aug,15812674,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15812674/,Purpose:Previous studies have found that the HERG K+ channel is highly expressed in some cancers. In the study reported here， we investigated HERG expression in various cancer cell lines， its correlation with chemosensitivity to vincristine， paclitaxel， and hydroxy-camptothecin， and its biochemical modulation.Methods:The MTT assay and clonogenic assay were used to detect the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs in vitro. HERG expression was analyzed by Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. Gene transfection was used to examine the changes in HERG-related chemosensitivity. Cell cycle phase distribution was detected by flow cytometry and drug combinations were evaluated by the MTT assay.Results:HERG expression levels differed widely between various human cancer cell lines and HT-29 cells expressing high levels of HERG were more sensitive than A549 cells expressing low levels of HERG to vincristine， paclitaxel， and hydroxy-camptothecin. In terms of IC50， the chemosensitivities of herg-transfected A549 cells to vincristine， paclitaxel and hydroxy-camptothecin were significantly increased. However， for cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil， no significant difference between herg-transfected A549 cells and parent A549 cells was detected. Erythromycin， a HERG K+ channel blocker， suppressed the growth of various cancer cells and the potency was correlated with HERG expression levels. Combinations of erythromycin and vincristine， paclitaxel or hydroxy-camptothecin showed synergy in cytotoxicity to HT-29 cells. Erythromycin also enhanced the G2/M arrest induced by vincristine in HT-29 cells. There were synergistic effects between erythromycin and vincristine， paclitaxel， and hydroxy-camptothecin， and chemosensitivity was correlated with HERG expression level.Conclusions:HERG expression levels and chemosensitivity were positively correlated for vincristine， paclitaxel， and hydroxy-camptothecin. Erythromycin was active as a modulator. These results suggest that HERG may serve as a molecular marker and modulating target for individualized cancer therapy.
Gene expression profiling in DQA1*0501+ children with untreated dermatomyositis: a novel model of pathogenesis.,J Immunol, 2002 Apr 15,11937576,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11937576/,Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)， the most common pediatric inflammatory myopathy， is a systemic vasculopathy affecting young children. Epidemiology studies documenting an antecedent illness in the 3 mo before the first definite symptom (rash and/or weakness) of JDM are supported by immunologic data that suggest that the disease pathophysiology is Ag driven. The purpose of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles in muscle biopsies of four untreated DQA1*0501(+) JDM children with profiles from children with a known necrotizing myopathy (Duchenne muscular dystrophy)， as well as an in vitro antiviral model (NF90)， and healthy pediatric controls. Nearly half (47%) of the dysregulated genes in JDM were associated with the immune response. In particular， increased expression of IFN-alphabeta-inducible genes 6-16， myxovirus resistance protein p78， latent cytosolic transcription factor， LMP2， and TAP1 was observed. This profile is consistent with an IFN-alphabeta transcription cascade seen in the in vitro viral resistance model. The IFN-alphabeta-inducible profile was superimposed on transcription profiles reflective of myofiber necrosis and regeneration shared with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (6-16)， immunofluorescence (thrombospondin 4)， and immunolocalization (IFN-gamma， p21). We hypothesize that these data support a model of Ag (?viral) induction of an apparent autoimmune disease based on dynamic interaction between the muscle， vascular， and immune systems in the genetically susceptible (DQA1*0501(+)) child.
Gene expression profiles and structural/functional features of the peri-implantation endometrium in natural and gonadotropin-stimulated cycles.,J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2004 Nov,15531538,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15531538/,It has been speculated that controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)， as performed during in vitro fertilization therapy， may negatively affect embryo implantation. The objective of this prospective and randomized study was to investigate gene expression profiles of the human endometrium during the window of implantation of gonadotropin-stimulated COH cycles compared with temporally matched natural cycles (d 21). Analysis was performed with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. In addition， other structural and functional features of the endometrium were investigated. Results corroborated that COH cycles depicted advancement of pinopodes appearance， histological features， and steroid receptor down-regulation when compared with natural cycles. These changes were associated with significant， albeit small， variations in gene expression (18 genes/expressed sequence tags and -1.55- to +3.40-fold changes). Second， there were significant changes in gene expression when comparing cycles using a GnRH agonist vs. a GnRH antagonist (13 genes/expressed sequence tags and +1.42- to +2.10-fold changes). This is the first attempt to elucidate gene expression profiles of the endometrium during COH cycles. The observed differences in gene expression in COH cycles using state-of-the-art protocols may not have a major functional impact on embryo implantation.
In vitro effect of malachite green on Candida albicans involves multiple pathways and transcriptional regulators UPC2 and STP2.,Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2012 Jan,22006003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22006003/,In this study， we show that a chemical dye， malachite green (MG)， which is commonly used in the fish industry as an antifungal， antiparasitic， and antibacterial agent， could effectively kill Candida albicans and non-C. albicans species. We have demonstrated that Candida cells are susceptible to MG at a very low concentration (MIC that reduces growth by 50% [MIC(50)]， 100 ng ml(-1)) and that the effect of MG is independent of known antifungal targets， such as ergosterol metabolism and major drug efflux pump proteins. Transcriptional profiling in response to MG treatment of C. albicans cells revealed that of a total of 207 responsive genes， 167 genes involved in oxidative stress， virulence， carbohydrate metabolism， heat shock， amino acid metabolism， etc.， were upregulated， while 37 genes involved in iron acquisition， filamentous growth， mitochondrial respiration， etc.， were downregulated. We confirmed experimentally that Candida cells exposed to MG resort to a fermentative mode of metabolism， perhaps due to defective respiration. In addition， we showed that MG triggers depletion of intracellular iron pools and enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These effects could be reversed by the addition of iron or antioxidants， respectively. We provided evidence that the antifungal effect of MG is exerted through the transcription regulators UPC2 (regulating ergosterol biosynthesis and azole resistance) and STP2 (regulating amino acid permease genes). Taken together， our transcriptome， genetic， and biochemical results allowed us to decipher the multiple mechanisms by which MG exerts its anti-Candida effects， leading to a metabolic shift toward fermentation， increased generation of ROS， labile iron deprivation， and cell necrosis.
Establishment of a de novo Reference Transcriptome of Histomonas meleagridis Reveals Basic Insights About Biological Functions and Potential Pathogenic Mechanisms of the Parasite.,Protist, 2017 Dec,29107797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29107797/,The protozoan flagellate Histomonas meleagridis is the causative agent of histomonosis in poultry. In turkeys， high mortality might be noticed whereas in chickens the disease is less severe despite production losses. Discovered over a century ago， molecular data on this parasite are scarce and genetic studies are in its infancy. To expand genomic information， a de novo transcriptome sequencing of H. meleagridis was performed from a virulent and an attenuated strain， cultivated in vitro as monoxenic mono-eukaryotic culture. Normalized cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced on Roche 454 GS FLX resulting in 1.17 million reads with an average read length of 458bp. Sequencing reads were assembled into two sets of >4500 contigs， which were further integrated to establish a reference transcriptome for H. meleagridis consisting of 3356 contigs. Following gene ontology analysis， data mining provided novel biological insights into proteostasis， cytoskeleton， metabolism， environmental adaptation and potential pathogenic mechanisms of H. meleagridis. Finally， the transcriptome data was used to perform an in silico drug screen to identify potential anti-histomonal drugs. Altogether， data recruited from virulent and attenuated parasites facilitate a better understanding of the parasites' molecular biology aiding the development of novel diagnostics and future research.Keywords:Histomonas meleagridis; de novo sequencing; drugs.; protozoa; transcriptome; virulence.
FOXC2 regulates the G2/M transition of stem cell-rich breast cancer cells and sensitizes them to PLK1 inhibition.,Sci Rep, 2016 Apr 11,27064522,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27064522/,Cancer cells with stem cell properties (CSCs) underpin the chemotherapy resistance and high therapeutic failure of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Even though CSCs are known to proliferate more slowly， they are sensitive to inhibitors of G2/M kinases such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Understanding the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms of CSCs will help target these cells more efficiently. Herein， we identify a novel role for the transcription factor FOXC2， which is mostly expressed in CSCs， in the regulation of cell cycle of CSC-enriched breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that FOXC2 expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner， with FOXC2 protein levels accumulating in G2， and rapidly decreasing during mitosis. Knockdown of FOXC2 in CSC-enriched TNBC cells delays mitotic entry without significantly affecting the overall proliferation rate of these cells. Moreover， PLK1 activity is important for FOXC2 protein stability， since PLK1 inhibition reduces FOXC2 protein levels. Indeed， FOXC2 expressing CSC-enriched TNBC cells are sensitive to PLK1 inhibition. Collectively， our findings demonstrate a novel role for FOXC2 as a regulator of the G2/M transition and elucidate the reason for the observed sensitivity of CSC-enriched breast cancer cells to PLK1 inhibitor.
Expression profile of mRNAs and miRNAs related to mitogen-activated kinases in HaCaT cell culture treated with lipopolysaccharide a and adalimumab.,Cell Cycle, 2024 Feb,38557266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38557266/,Studies indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) exhibit activation and overexpression within psoriatic lesions. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the expression patterns of genes encoding MAPKs and microRNA (miRNA) molecules that potentially regulate their expression in human adult low-calcium high-temperature (HaCaT) keratinocytes when exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide A (LPS) and adalimumab. HaCaT cells underwent treatment with 1 µg/mL LPS for 8 hours， followed by treatment with 8 µg/mL adalimumab for 2， 8， or 24 hours. Untreated cells served as controls. The molecular analysis involved microarray， quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR)， and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses. Changes in the expression profile of seven mRNAs: dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1)， dual specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3)， dual specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4)， mitogen-activated protein kinase 9 (MAPK9)， mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2)， mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MAP2K2)， andMAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2(MAPKAPK2， also known asMK2)in cell culture exposed to LPS or LPS and the drug compared to the control. It was noted that miR-34a may potentially regulate the activity ofDUSP1，DUSP3， andDUSP4， while miR-1275 is implicated in regulatingMAPK9expression. Additionally， miR-382 and miR-3188 are potential regulators ofDUSP4levels， and miR-200-5p is involved in regulatingMAPKAPK2andMAP3K2levels. Thus， the analysis showed that these mRNA molecules and the proteins and miRNAs they encode appear to be useful molecular markers for monitoring the efficacy of adalimumab therapy.Keywords:Mitogen-activated protein kinases; adalimumab; lipopolysaccharides.
Pharmacological and genomic profiling of neurofibromatosis type 1 plexiform neurofibroma-derived schwann cells.,Sci Data, 2018 Jun 12,29893754,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893754/,Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by peripheral nervous system tumors (PNSTs)， including plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) that cause nerve dysfunction， deformity， pain damage to adjacent structures， and can undergo malignant transformation. There are no effective therapies to prevent or treat pNFs. Drug discovery efforts are slowed by the 'benign' nature of the Schwann cells that are the progenitor cells of pNF. In this work we characterize a set of pNF-derived cell lines at the genomic level (via SNP Arrays， RNAseq， and Whole Exome- Sequencing)， and carry out dose response-based quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) with a collection of 1，912 oncology-focused compounds in a 1536-well microplate cell proliferation assays. Through the characterization and screening of NF1-/-， NF1+/+and NF1+/-Schwann cell lines， this resource introduces novel therapeutic avenues for the development for NF1 associated pNF as well as all solid tumors with NF1 somatic mutations. The integrated data sets are openly available for further analysis at http://www.synapse.org/pnfCellCulture.
Identification of phenothiazine as an ETV1‑targeting agent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors using the Connectivity Map.,Int J Oncol, 2019 Aug,31268158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268158/,Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are gastrointestinal tract sarcomas that commonly contain a mutation in the tyrosine kinases， KIT and platelet‑derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA). Imatinib， sunitinib and regorafenib are all effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however， acquired resistance is inevitable. The E26 variant 1 (ETV1) pathway has been found to be a key downstream effector of KIT and is therefore a reasonable therapeutic target for this disease. In this study， we explored the potential agents targeting ETV1 in GISTs by uploading an ETV1 knockout gene signature of GIST cell lines to the pattern‑matching software 'Connectivity Map'. The activity and mechanisms of identified agents were examined using an in vitro model. Four drugs were identified: Suberanilohydroxamic acid and trichostatin [two histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs)] and trifluoperazine and thioridazine (two phenothiazine‑class drugs). Western blot analysis demonstrated that all four drugs had ETV1‑downregulating effects. As HDACIs have been previously studied in GISTs， we focused on phenothiazine. Phenothiazine was found to exert cytotoxicity and to induce apoptosis and autophagy in GISTs. Treatment with phenothiazine had little effect on the KIT/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway， but instead upregulated extracellular‑signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) activity. A combination of phenothiazine and a MEK inhibitor had a synergistic cytotoxic effect on GISTs. Western blot analysis indicated that ELK1 and early growth response 1 (EGR1) were activated/upregulated following phenothiazine treatment， and the MEK inhibitor/phenothiazine combination downregulated the ERK/ELK1/EGR1 pathway， resulting in diminished autophagy， as well as enhanced apoptosis. On the whole， the findings of this study established phenothiazine as a novel class of therapeutic agents in GIST treatment and demonstrate that a combination of phenothiazine and MEK inhibitor has great potential for use in the treatment of GISTs.
Role of ERCC1 promoter hypermethylation in drug resistance to cisplatin in human gliomas.,Int J Cancer, 2010 Apr 15,19626585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19626585/,Overexpression of ERCC1 mRNA is associated with drug resistance to cisplatin in human gliomas， but the role of the ERCC1 promoter in drug resistance has not been demonstrated. We have used sodium bisulfite sequencing to compare ERCC1 promoter methylation patterns in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant glioma cells. The levels of ERCC1 DNA methylation， mRNA and protein in 32 human glioma samples were examined by methylation specific PCR， real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry， respectively. Meanwhile， cisplatin sensitivities to these human glioma samples were tested by histoculture drug response assay. Hypermethylation was observed in the upstream 5Kb region of the ERCC1 promoter of cisplatin-sensitive glioma cell lines. ERCC1 DNA methylation levels were highly variable in 32 human glioma samples ranging from 0.1 to 0.87， which have shown significant difference between cisplatin-sensitive samples and cisplatin-resistant samples (p < 0.05). The relative expression levels of ERCC1 mRNA in 32 glioma samples were also variable from 0.01 to 5.71. No detectable or low expression of ERCC1 protein was shown in 7 glioma samples. ERCC1 promoter methylation was inversely correlated to mRNA expression (r = -0.903 p = 0.001) as well as protein expression (r = -0.884 p = 0.001). Moreover， ERCC1 mRNA expression was significantly associated with protein levels (r = 0.840 p = 0.001). In summary， the aberrant CpG island methylation in ERCC1 promoter region exists in human glioma cell lines as well as clinical glioma samples. ERCC1 DNA methylation could regulate the expression of downstream mRNA and protein， and was associated with cisplatin chemosensitivity.
The delivery and evaluation of RNAi therapeutics for heterotopic ossification pathologies.,Methods Mol Biol, 2014,24155228,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24155228/,RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool being used to develop therapies for pathologies caused by gene overexpression. Heterotopic ossification pathologies such as trauma-induced heterotopic ossification and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva may be treatable with an RNAi approach. However， there is a lack of consensus in literature regarding the delivery conditions and evaluation of RNAi therapeutics in these disease models. Here， we describe in vitro protocols for the delivery of polymer-based RNAi therapeutics as well as a streamlined strategy for the assessment of osteoblast lineage progression due to dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein signaling. This strategy focuses on the quantification of early-stage osteoblast transcription factors RUNX2 and OSX， followed by the measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and late-stage matrix deposition.
Nm23-H1 can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in B cells.,Cancer Biol Ther, 2010 Jun 15,20448457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20448457/,Nm23-H1 is a well-known tumor metastasis suppressor， which functions as a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase converting nucleoside diphosphates to nucleoside triphosphates with an expense of ATP. It regulates a variety of cellular activities， including proliferation， development， migration and differentiation known to be modulated by a series of complex signaling pathway. Few studies have addressed the mechanistic action of Nm23-H1 in the context of these cellular processes. To determine the downstream pathways modulated by Nm23-H1， we expressed Nm23-H1 in a Burkitt lymphoma derived B-cell line BJAB and performed pathway specific microarray analysis. The genes with significant changes in expression patterns were clustered in groups which are responsible for regulating cell cycle， p53 activities and apoptosis. We found a general reduction of cell cycle regulatory proteins including cyclins and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (anti proliferation)， and upregulation of apoptotic genes which included caspase 3， 9 and Bcl-x. Nm23-H1 was also found to upregulate p53 and downregulate p21 expression. A number of these genes were validated by real time PCR and results from promoter assays indicated that Nm23-H1 expression downregulated cyclin D1 in a dose responsive manner. Further， we show that Nm23-H1 forms a complex with the cellular transcription factor AP1 to modulate cyclin D1 expression levels. BJAB cells expressing Nm23-H1 showed reduced proliferation rate and were susceptible to increased apoptosis which may in part be due to a direct interaction between Nm23-H1 and p53. These results suggest that Nm23-H1 may have a role in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in human B-cells.
Profiling and bioinformatics analyses reveal differential circular RNA expression in radioresistant esophageal cancer cells.,J Transl Med, 2016 Jul 28,27465405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27465405/,Background:Acquired radioresistance during radiotherapy is considered as the most important reason for local tumor recurrence or treatment failure. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been identified as microRNA sponges and involve in various biological processes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of circRNAs in the radioresistance of esophageal cancer.Methods:Total RNA was isolated from human parental cell line KYSE-150 and self-established radioresistant esophageal cancer cell line KYSE-150R， and hybridized to Arraystar Human circRNA Array. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm the circRNA expression profiles obtained from the microarray data. Bioinformatic tools including gene ontology (GO) analysis， KEGG pathway analysis and network analysis were done for further assessment.Results:Among the detected candidate 3752 circRNA genes， significant upregulation of 57 circRNAs and downregulation of 17 circRNAs in human radioresistant esophageal cancer cell line KYSE-150R were observed compared with the parental cell line KYSE-150 (fold change ≥2.0 and P < 0.05). There were 9 out of these candidate circRNAs were validated by real-time PCR. GO analysis revealed that numerous target genes， including most microRNAs were involved in the biological processes. There were more than 400 target genes enrichment on Wnt signaling pathway. CircRNA_001059 and circRNA_000167 were the two largest nodes in circRNA/microRNA co-expression network.Conclusions:Our study revealed a comprehensive expression and functional profile of differentially expressed circRNAs in radioresistant esophageal cancer cells， indicating possible involvement of these dysregulated circRNAs in the development of radiation resistance.Keywords:Circular RNA; Esophageal cancer; Microarray; Radioresistance.
Zwitterion-functionalized dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles for serum-enhanced gene delivery to inhibit cancer cell metastasis.,Acta Biomater, 2019 Nov,31513912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513912/,We demonstrate a novel serum-enhanced gene delivery approach using zwitterion-functionalized dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) as a non-viral vector for inhibition of cancer cell metastasis in vitro. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers of generation 5 decorated with zwitterion carboxybetaine acrylamide (CBAA) and lysosome-targeting agent morpholine (Mor) were utilized to entrap gold NPs. We show that both Mor-modified and Mor-free Au DENPs are cytocompatible and can effectively deliver plasmid DNA encoding different reporter genes to cancer cells in medium with or without serum. Strikingly， due to the antifouling property exerted by the attached zwitterion CBAA， the gene delivery efficiency of Mor-modified Au DENPs and the Mor-free Au DENPs in the serum-containing medium are 1.4 and 1.7 times higher than the corresponding vector in serum-free medium， respectively. In addition， the Mor-free vector has a better gene expression efficiency than the Mor-modified one although the Mor modification enables the polyplexes to have enhanced cancer cell uptake. Wound healing and hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) protein expression assay data reveal that the expression of HIC1 gene in cancer cells enables effective inhibition of cell migration. Our findings suggest that the created zwitterion-functionalized Au DENPs may be employed as a powerful vector for serum-enhanced gene therapy of different diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: One major challenge in the non-viral gene delivery system is that the strong interaction between serum protein and the positively charged vector/gene polyplexes neutralize the positive charge of the polyplexes and form possible protein corona， thereby significantly reducing their cellular uptake efficiency and subsequent gene transfection outcome. Here we demonstrate the conceptual advances in the serum-enhanced gene delivery using zwitterionic modification of polycationic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs). We demonstrate that partial zwitterionic modification of Au DENPs is able to confer them with antifouling property to resist serum protein adsorption. Hence the vector/DNA polyplexes are able to maintain their positive potentials and small hydrodynamic size in the serum environment， where serum solely play the role as a nutrition factor for enhanced gene delivery. We demonstrate that partial modification of zwitterion carboxybetaine acrylamide (CBAA) and morpholine (Mor) onto the surface Au DENPs renders the vector with both antifouling property and lysosome targeting ability， respectively. The generated functional Au DENPs can compact pDNA to form polyplexes that enable serum-enhanced gene expression. In particular， once complexed with hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) gene， the polyplexes can significantly inhibit cancer cell migration and metastasis.Keywords:Dendrimers; Gene delivery; Gold nanoparticles; HIC1 gene; Zwitterions.
PI3K signaling and miRNA expression during the response of quiescent human fibroblasts to distinct proliferative stimuli.,Genome Biol, 2006,16737555,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16737555/,Background:Serum treatment of quiescent human dermal fibroblasts induces proliferation， coupled with a complex physiological response that is indicative of their normal role in wound-healing. However， it is not known to what extent such complex transcriptional events are specific to a given cell type and signal， and how these global changes are coordinately regulated. We have profiled the global transcriptional program of human fibroblasts from two different tissue sources to distinct growth stimuli， and identified a striking conservation in their gene-expression signatures.Results:We found that the wound-healing program of gene expression was not specific to the response of dermal fibroblasts to serum but was regulated more broadly. However， there were specific differences among different stimuli with regard to signaling pathways that mediate these transcriptional programs. Our data suggest that the PI3-kinase pathway is differentially involved in mediating the responses of cells to serum as compared with individual peptide growth factors. Expression profiling indicated that let7 and other miRNAs with similar expression profiles may be involved in regulating the transcriptional program in response to proliferative signals.Conclusion:This study provides insights into how different stimuli use distinct as well as conserved signaling and regulatory mechanisms to mediate genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming during cell proliferation. Our results indicate that conservation of transcriptional programs and their regulation among different cell types may be much broader than previously appreciated.
Resveratrol exerts antiproliferative activity and induces apoptosis in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.,Clin Cancer Res, 2008 Mar 15,18347188,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18347188/,Purpose:Resveratrol (3，4'，5-tri-hydroxy-trans-stilbene) is an antioxidant constituent of a wide variety of plant species including grapes. It has gained considerable attention because of its anticancer properties， as shown in solid and hematologic malignancies. Whether resveratrol could inhibit proliferation or induce cytotoxicity in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) was investigated.Experimental design:We studied resveratrol-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of cytotoxicity in WM cell lines， WM primary tumor cells， IgM-secreting cells， and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The mechanisms of action and different signaling pathways involved were studied using Western blot and gene expression profile analysis. Resveratrol activity was also evaluated in the bone marrow microenvironment. We finally investigated whether or not resveratrol could have any synergistic effect if used in combination with other drugs widely used in the treatment of WM.Results:A schematic image illustrating the location and expression of the aurora kinases A， B， and C during mitosis. Resveratrol inhibited proliferation and induced cytotoxicity against WM cells， IgM-secreting cells， as well as primary WM cells， without affecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells; down-regulated Akt， extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases， and Wnt signaling pathways， as well as Akt activity; induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; and triggered c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal-kinase activation， followed by the activation of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways. Lastly， adherence to bone marrow stromal cells did not confer protection to WM cells against resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore， resveratrol showed synergistic cytotoxicity when combined with dexamethasone， fludarabine， and bortezomib.Conclusion:Our data show that resveratrol has significant antitumor activity in WM， providing the framework for clinical trials in this disease.
High yield of cells committed to the photoreceptor-like cells from conjunctiva mesenchymal stem cells on nanofibrous scaffolds.,Mol Biol Rep, 2013 Jun,23588957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23588957/,Transplantation of stem cells using biodegradable and biocompatible nanofibrous scaffolds is a promising therapeutic approach for treating inherited retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. In this study， conjunctiva mesenchymal stem cells (CJMSCs) were seeded onto poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibrous scaffolds and were induced to differentiate toward photoreceptor cell lineages. Furthermore， the effects of orientation of scaffold on photoreceptor differentiation were examined. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging， quantitative real time RT-PCR (qPCR) and immunocytochemistry were used to analyze differentiated cells and their expression of photoreceptor-specific genes. Our observations demonstrated the differentiation of CJMSCs to photoreceptor cells on nanofibrous scaffolds and suggested their potential application in retinal regeneration. SEM imaging showed that CJMSCs were spindle shaped and well oriented on the aligned nanofiber scaffolds. The expression of rod photoreceptor-specific genes was significantly higher in CJMSCs differentiated on randomly-oriented nanofibers compared to those on aligned nanofibers. According to our results we may conclude that the nanofibrous PLLA scaffold reported herein could be used as a potential cell carrier for retinal tissue engineering and a combination of electrospun nanofiber scaffolds and MSC-derived conjunctiva stromal cells may have potential application in retinal regenerative therapy.
Erythropoietin Signaling Regulates Key Epigenetic and Transcription Networks in Fetal Neural Progenitor Cells.,Sci Rep, 2017 Oct 30,29084993,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084993/,Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor are highly expressed in the developing nervous system， and exogenous EPO therapy is potentially neuroprotective， however the epigenetic and transcriptional changes downstream of EPO signaling in neural cells are not well understood. To delineate epigenetic changes associated with EPO signaling， we compared histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) in EPO treated and control fetal neural progenitor cells， identifying 1，150 differentially bound regions. These regions were highly enriched near protein coding genes and had significant overlap with H4Acetylation， a mark of active regulatory elements. Motif analyses and co-occupancy studies revealed a complex regulatory network underlying the differentially bound regions， including previously identified mediators of EPO signaling (STAT5， STAT3)， and novel factors such as REST， an epigenetic modifier central to neural differentiation and plasticity， and NRF1， a key regulator of antioxidant response and mitochondrial biogenesis. Global transcriptome analyses on neural tubes isolated from E9.0 EpoR-null and littermate control embryos validated our in vitro findings， further suggesting a role for REST and NRF1 downstream of EPO signaling. These data support a role for EPO in regulating the survival， proliferation， and differentiation of neural progenitor cells， and suggest a basis for its function in neural development and neuroprotection.
Genomic amplification of Fanconi anemia complementation group A (FancA) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC): Cellular mechanisms of radioresistance and clinical relevance.,Cancer Lett, 2017 Feb 1,27867017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27867017/,Radio (chemo) therapy is a crucial treatment modality for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)， but relapse is frequent， and the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Therefore， novel biomarkers are urgently needed. Previously， we identified gains on 16q23-24 to be associated with amplification of the Fanconi anemia A (FancA) gene and to correlate with reduced progression-free survival after radiotherapy. Here， we analyzed the effects of FancA on radiation sensitivity in vitro， characterized the underlying mechanisms， and evaluated their clinical relevance. Silencing of FancA expression in HNSCC cell lines with genomic gains on 16q23-24 resulted in significantly impaired clonogenic survival upon irradiation. Conversely， overexpression of FancA in immortalized keratinocytes conferred increased survival accompanied by improved DNA repair， reduced accumulation of chromosomal translocations， but no hyperactivation of the FA/BRCA-pathway. Downregulation of interferon signaling as identified by microarray analyses， enforced irradiation-induced senescence， and elevated production of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) appeared to be candidate mechanisms contributing to FancA-mediated radioresistance. Data of the TCGA HNSCC cohort confirmed the association of gains on 16q24.3 with FancA overexpression and impaired overall survival. Importantly， transcriptomic alterations similar to those observed upon FancA overexpression in vitro strengthened the clinical relevance. Overall， FancA amplification and overexpression appear to be crucial for radiotherapeutic failure in HNSCC.Keywords:DNA damage repair; Fanconi anemia; Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Radioresistance; Radiotherapy; Senescence.

Differential expression of microRNAs contributed to the health efficacy of EGCG in in vitro subarachnoid hemorrhage model.,Food Funct, 2017 Dec 13,29160895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29160895/,(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) exhibits a broader spectrum health efficacy in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) therapy; the mechanisms， however， are largely unknown. Given that miRNAs play important roles in regulation of thousands of gene expressions， the effect of EGCG on the expression of miRNAs was investigated to explore the multi-targeting actions of EGCG by using an in vitro SAH model. MTT and western blot assays were used to assess the health effects of EGCG in SAH progression; the results showed that oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb)-induced cell proliferation and excessive autophagic activation were significantly inhibited by 50 μM EGCG， but not by 1 μM EGCG. By high throughput sequencing analysis， the miRNA profiles of normal， SAH and EGCG (1 and 50 μM) groups were compared and a total of 953 miRNAs were identified. Of 192 differentially expressed miRNAs， 43 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in SAH (p < 0.01). However， EGCG significantly increased the number of differential expressions of miRNAs， which showed 144 and 138 miRNAs (112 and 115 upregulated， 32 and 23 downregulated， p < 0.01) in 1 μM and 50 μM EGCG groups， respectively. Among all the differentially expressed miRNAs， 13 miRNAs were shared by the three groups. 5 miRNAs (miR-218-5p， miR-218b， miR-143-3p， miR-101a-3p， miR-30a-3p) were detected in both SAH and EGCG 1 μM groups， and 104 miRNAs were shared by the EGCG 1 μM and EGCG 50 μM groups. Only 1 miRNA (miR-532-5p) was discovered in both SAH and EGCG 50 μM groups. Moreover， 24， 22 and 20 specific differentially expressed miRNAs were discovered in SAH， 1 μM and 50 μM EGCG groups， respectively. The predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs showed that the most impacted MAPK signaling pathway， particularly the upregulated p38 expression in the SAH group， was restored to the normal level in both EGCG groups， but the calcium signaling pathway was enriched only in the EGCG 50 μM group. These results revealed that differential expression of miRNAs is fundamental to understand the multiple targets actions of EGCG in SAH therapy， and simultaneously targeting more robust signaling pathways could determine the therapeutic effects of EGCG.
Linezolid， vancomycin and daptomycin modulate cytokine production， Toll-like receptors and phagocytosis in a human in vitro model of sepsis.,J Antibiot (Tokyo), 2015 Aug,25735844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735844/,Conventional antibiotics exhibit immunomodulatory properties beneficial in the treatment of sepsis. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria have become a problem in sepsis therapy， giving rise to increased use of last-resort antibiotics; for example， linezolid (LIN)， vancomycin (VAN) and daptomycin (DAP). As the immunomodulatory properties of these antibiotics in treating sepsis are unknown， this study examined the effect of VAN， LIN and DAP on the immune response under sepsis-like conditions in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated THP-1 monocytes were incubated with LIN， VAN or DAP. Gene expression of cytokines (TNFα， IL-1β， IL-6， IL-10) and Toll-like receptors (TLR1， 2， 4， 6， 7 and 9) was monitored and phagocytosis was determined following coincubation with E. coli. The antibiotics differentially modulated the gene expression of the investigated cytokines. While LIN and VAN upregulated the expression of all TLRs， DAP downregulated mRNA levels of TLR1， TLR2 and TLR6， which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from Gram-positive bacteria. In addition， LIN inhibited， whereas VAN promoted the phagocytic activity of monocytes. Our results suggest that LIN and VAN possess pro-inflammatory properties， whereas DAP might reduce the immune response to Gram-positive bacteria in sepsis. Furthermore， VAN might be beneficial in the prevention of Gram-negative infections by increasing the phagocytosis of E. coli.
MicroRNA-206 facilitates gastric cancer cell apoptosis and suppresses cisplatin resistance by targeting MAPK2 signaling pathway.,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci, 2019 Jan,30657558,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30657558/,
Gene expression profiling revealed survivin as a target of 3，3'-diindolylmethane-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.,Cancer Res, 2006 May 1,16651453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16651453/,The phytochemical indole-3-carbinol (I3C)， found in cruciferous vegetables， and its major acid-catalyzed reaction product 3，3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) showed anticancer activity mediated by its pleiotropic effects on cell cycle progression， apoptosis， carcinogen bioactivation， and DNA repair. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which 3，3'-diindolylmethane exerts its effects on breast cancer cells， we have used microarray gene expression profiling analysis. We found a total of 1，238 genes altered in 3，3'-diindolylmethane-treated cells， among which 550 genes were down-regulated and 688 genes were up-regulated. Clustering analysis showed significant alterations in some genes that are critically involved in the regulation of cell growth， cell cycle， apoptosis， and signal transduction， including down-regulation of survivin. Previous studies have shown that antiapoptotic protein survivin is overexpressed in many human cancers， including breast cancer. However， very little or no information is available regarding the consequence of down-regulation of survivin for cancer therapy. We， therefore， hypothesized that down-regulation of survivin as observed by 3，3'-diindolylmethane could be an important approach for the treatment of breast cancer. We have tested our hypothesis using multiple molecular approaches and found that 3，3'-diindolylmethane inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by down-regulating survivin， Bcl-2， and cdc25A expression and also caused up-regulation of p21(WAF1) expression， which could be responsible for cell cycle arrest. Down-regulation of survivin by small interfering RNA before 3，3'-diindolylmethane treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis， whereas overexpression of survivin by cDNA transfection abrogated 3，3'-diindolylmethane-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results suggest that targeting survivin by 3，3'-diindolylmethane could be a new and novel approach for the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer.

Potential differentiation ability of gingiva originated human mesenchymal stem cell in the presence of tacrolimus.,Sci Rep, 2016 Oct 10,27721434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27721434/,The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential differentiation ability of gingiva originated human mesenchymal stem cell in the presence of tacrolimus. Tacrolimus-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres were prepared using electrospraying technique. In vitro release study of tacrolimus-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres was performed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Gingiva-derived stem cells were isolated and incubated with tacrolimus or tacrolimus-loaded microspheres. Release study of the microspheres revealed prolonged release profiles of tacrolimus without any significant initial burst release. The microsphere itself did not affect the morphology of the mesenchymal stem cells， and cell morphology was retained after incubation with microspheres loaded with tacrolimus at 1 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL. Cultures grown in the presence of microspheres loaded with tacrolimus at 1 μg/mL showed the highest mineralization. Alkaline phosphatase activity increased with an increase in incubation time. The highest expression of pSmad1/5 was achieved in the group receiving tacrolimus 0.1 μg/mL every third day， and the highest expression of osteocalcin was achieved in the group receiving 1 μg/mL every third day. Biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based microspheres loaded with tacrolimus promoted mineralization. Microspheres loaded with tacrolimus may be applied for increased osteoblastic differentiation.
A₂B receptors mediate the induction of early genes and inhibition of arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation via Epac.,Cardiovasc Res, 2011 Apr 1,21109603,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21109603/,ims:Extracellular adenosine and adenine nucleotides play important roles in the regulation of the blood vessel tonus and platelet aggregation. Less is known about the effects of these extracellular signalling molecules on gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells involved in long-term vascular effects. In the present study， we therefore searched for adenosine-induced changes in the expression of early genes in cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs).Methods and results:Whole-genome DNA array hybridization revealed that adenosine induced a set of early genes including the nuclear receptor subfamily 4， group A， member 1 (NR4A1/Nur77/TR3). The pattern of the effects of adenosine on gene expression resembles the change in expression induced by the direct activator of adenylate cyclase forskolin. Real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR confirmed that adenosine and its analogue N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine elicited a strong induction of NR4A1. These effects were markedly attenuated by A(2B) receptor antagonists including 8-[4-(4-benzylpiperazide-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1-propylxanthine (PSB-601) and were mimicked by a cyclic AMP (cAMP) analogue [8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-cAMP， 8CPT] acting on the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). Long-term experiments over 5 days showed that 2-chloroadenosine decreased cell proliferation in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor. This effect of 2-chloroadenosine was also attenuated by PSB-601 and mimicked by 8CPT. Treatment with small interfering RNA directed against NR4A1 attenuated the inhibitory effect of 8CPT on proliferation.Conclusions:In summary， our results demonstrate the operation of adenosine A₂(B) receptors mediating an early induction of NR4A1 and a decrease in cell proliferation via the cAMP/Epac pathway in HCASMCs.

Interferon-gamma-induced neuronal differentiation of human umbilical cord blood-derived progenitors.,Leukemia, 2009 Oct,19458627,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19458627/,Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) provides a source of progenitors for cell therapy. We isolated and characterized an HUCB-derived population of progenitors (HUCBNP)， differentiated toward neuronal phenotype by human neuroblastoma-conditioning medium (CM) and nerve growth factor (NGF)， which have been found to confer neuroprotection toward hypoxia-mediated neuronal injury. This study investigated whether interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) contributes to HUCBNP differentiation. IFN-gamma was detected in the CM used for the induction of differentiation of HUCBNP and a neutralizing antibody of IFN-gamma significantly inhibited either IFN-gamma or CM-induced differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of CM-differentiated HUCBNP， identified 86 genes as highly upregulated， among them 25 were IFN-induced (such as 2'，5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 and 2， IFN-induced protein and transmembrane proteins， STAT1 (IFN-gamma-receptor signal transducer and activator of transcription) and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 5). Treatment of HUCBNP with human recombinant IFN-gamma， inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-gamma (1-100 ng/ml) enhanced neuronal differentiation， expressed by neurite outgrowths and increased expression of the neuronal markers beta-tubulin III， microtubule-associated protein 2， neuronal nuclei， neurofilament M and neuronal-specific enolase. IFN-gamma additively cooperated with NGF to induce the differentiation of HUCBNP. These data indicate that IFN-gamma promotes neuronal differentiation of HUCB-derived progenitors， proposing its use in future protocols towards cell therapy.
Gene expression profile of coronary artery cells treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reveals off-target effects.,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol, 2012 Jun,22668799,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22668799/,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have come under scrutiny because of the gastrointestinal， renal， and cardiovascular toxicity associated with prolonged use of these drugs. The purpose of this study was to identify molecular targets for NSAIDs related to cellular toxicity with a view to optimize drug efficacy in the clinic. Coronary artery smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were treated with low (clinically achievable) and high (typically used in preclinical studies) concentrations of celecoxib， NS398， and ibuprofen for 24 hours. NSAIDs-induced gene expression changes were evaluated by microarray analysis and validated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The functional significance of differentially expressed genes was evaluated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. At high concentrations， NSAIDs altered the expression of genes regulating cell proliferation and cell death. NSAIDs also altered genes associated with cardiovascular functions including inflammation， thrombosis， fibrinolysis， coronary artery disease， and hypertension. The gene expression was most impacted by ibuprofen， celecoxib， and NS398， in that order. This study revealed that NSAIDs altered expression of an array of genes associated with cardiovascular events and emphasizes the potential for fingerprinting drugs in preclinical studies to assess the potential drug toxicity and to optimize the drug efficacy in clinical settings.
Molecular and biochemical mining of heat-shock and 14-3-3 proteins in drug-induced protoscolices of Echinococcus granulosus and the detection of a candidate gene for anthelmintic resistance.,J Helminthol, 2011 Jun,20735897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20735897/,Cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus is a disease that affects both humans and animals. In humans the disease is treated by surgery with a supplementary option of chemotherapy with a benzimidazole compound. During the present study heat-shock protein 60 (HSP 60) was identified as one of the most frequently expressed biomolecules by E. granulosus after albendazole treatment. Data were correlated with 14-3-3 protein signature， and overexpression of this molecule after albendazole induction was an indicator of cell survival and signal transduction during in vitro maintenance of E. granulosus for up to 72 h. This observation was further correlated with a uniform expression pattern of a housekeeping gene (actin II). Out of three β-tubulin gene isoforms of E. granulosus， β-tubulin gene isoform 2 showed a conserved point mutation indicative of benzimidazole resistance.
Effect of endothelial cell proliferation on atherogenesis: a role of p21(Sdi/Cip/Waf1) in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells.,Atherosclerosis, 2010 Sep,20598695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20598695/,Objective:Uniform laminar shear stress (LS) and disturbed turbulent shear stress (DS) are thought to play opposite roles in preventing or inducing atherosclerosis. Endothelial cell (EC) growth and monocyte adhesion to ECs， an early event in atherosclerosis， are also oppositely regulated by LS and DS. However， how atherogenesis is affected by the regulation of growth by blood flow is unknown. Here we examined the role of p21(Sdi/Cip/Waf1) (p21)， a growth inhibitor induced by LS， in monocyte adhesion to ECs.Methods:p21 was overexpressed by transfecting a p21-expressing adenoviral vector into ECs. Factors linking EC growth， monocyte adhesion， and p21 were examined by microarray analysis， PCR and Western blotting.Results:Compared with DS， in the presence or absence of TNFalpha， LS significantly inhibited EC growth and monocyte adhesion to ECs. Both EC proliferation and monocyte adhesion induced by DS were inhibited by p21-overexpression. LS suppressed the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Thioredoxin (TRX) activity， which is suppressed by TXNIP， was therefore higher under LS than DS， as reported previously. p21-overexpression significantly suppressed the DS-induced TXNIP expression， and inhibited the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5/RANTES)， which stimulates leukocyte recruitment and is downregulated by ROS scavenging.Conclusion:p21 may function to prevent atherogenesis by regulating the redox balance， which leads to the inhibition of adhesion molecule and chemokine expression in ECs under LS.
Suicide gene therapy with an adenovirus expressing the fusion gene CD::UPRT in human glioblastomas: different sensitivities correlate with p53 status.,J Gene Med, 2004 Dec,15515126,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15515126/,Background:Several gene therapy strategies have been designed for cancer treatment. Intra-tumoral injection of adenoviruses expressing pro-drug-converting enzymes is one such strategy. Although the efficacy of these therapies was tested in animal models， little work has been devoted to the determination of critical variables for success. In this work， we aimed at better understanding variables that affect the cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (CD::UPRT)-based strategy in two human glioblastomas.Methods:We have constructed two adenoviruses expressing either CD or the fusion protein CD::UPRT. We have tested their anti-tumor activity in combination with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) in the glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251， which are p53-wt and p53-deficient， respectively. Anti-tumor activity has also been investigated in spheroid structures.Results:The superiority of CD::UPRT over CD was confirmed in both glioblastoma cells. We found that the pro-drug concentration required for anti-tumor activity was 9-fold higher in U251 than in U87， while multiplicity of infection (MOI) as low as 6 was sufficient to achieve 50% killing. Bystander activity was observed with as few as 2 and 6% transduced cells for U87 and U251， respectively. Differences in sensitivity between U87 and U251 were not due to differences in transduction， transgene expression， or intercellular transport， but were related to 5-FU sensitivity and p53 status. Also， it is noteworthy that， in contrast to U87， U251 spheroids barely responded to the treatment， whereas their monolayer counterparts were very sensitive.Conclusions:Our study has shown that p53 status is important for CD::UPRT/5-FC treatment. Moreover， this study demonstrated that the three-dimensional spheroid model is a more stringent in vitro model for suicide gene therapy evaluation than are monolayer cultures.
LncRNA EPR controls epithelial proliferation by coordinating Cdkn1a transcription and mRNA decay response to TGF-β.,Nat Commun, 2019 Apr 29,31036808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31036808/,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as regulators of fundamental biological processes. Here we report on the characterization of an intergenic lncRNA expressed in epithelial tissues which we termed EPR (Epithelial cell Program Regulator). EPR is rapidly downregulated by TGF-β and its sustained expression largely reshapes the transcriptome， favors the acquisition of epithelial traits， and reduces cell proliferation in cultured mammary gland cells as well as in an animal model of orthotopic transplantation. EPR generates a small peptide that localizes at epithelial cell junctions but the RNA molecule per se accounts for the vast majority of EPR-induced gene expression changes. Mechanistically， EPR interacts with chromatin and regulates Cdkn1a gene expression by affecting both its transcription and mRNA decay through its association with SMAD3 and the mRNA decay-promoting factor KHSRP， respectively. We propose that EPR enables epithelial cells to control proliferation by modulating waves of gene expression in response to TGF-β.
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A/AOF2/BHC110) is expressed and is an epigenetic drug target in chondrosarcoma， Ewing's sarcoma， osteosarcoma， and rhabdomyosarcoma.,Hum Pathol, 2012 Aug,22245111,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22245111/,Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (GeneID 23028)， a flavin-dependent monoamine oxidoreductase and a histone demethylase， serves as an epigenetic coregulator of transcription. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 is up-regulated in neuroblastoma and in bladder， breast， colorectal， gastric， lung， and neuroendocrine cancers， and its overexpression drives the cell cycle of otherwise nontransformed human cells， suggesting oncogenic properties. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 was recently reported to be also overexpressed in several different mesenchymal tumors. We investigated lysine-specific demethylase 1 expression in over 500 sarcomas by gene expression profiling and tissue microarray-coupled immunohistochemical analyses and confirmed lysine-specific demethylase 1 overexpression in rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma. We also show for the first time that lysine-specific demethylase 1 is also overexpressed in chondrosarcoma， Ewing's sarcoma， and osteosarcoma wherein it localizes in cell nuclei. We further show that a US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that inhibits lysine-specific demethylase 1 also inhibits chondrosarcoma， Ewing's sarcoma， osteosarcoma， and rhabdomyosarcoma cell growth in vitro. These data suggest that lysine-specific demethylase 1 plays a role in sarcoma pathology and that lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibition strategies might represent a novel means to inhibiting growth of lysine-specific demethylase 1-overexpressing sarcomas.
Tissue-specific Differentiation Potency of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells from Perinatal Tissues.,Sci Rep, 2016 Apr 5,27045658,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27045658/,Human perinatal tissue is an abundant source of mesenchymal stromal cells(MSCs) and lacks the ethical concerns. Perinatal MSCs can be obtained from various tissues as like amnion， chorion， and umbilical cord. Still， little is known of the distinct nature of each MSC type. In this study， we successfully isolated and cultured MSCs from amnion(AMSCs)， chorion(CMSCs)， and umbilical cord(UC-MSCs). Proliferation potential was different among them， that AMSCs revealed the lowest proliferation rate due to increased Annexin V and senescence-associated β-galactosidase positive cells. We demonstrated distinct characteristic gene expression according to the source of the original tissue using microarray. In particular， genes associated with apoptosis and senescence including CDKN2A were up-regulated in AMSCs. In CMSCs， genes associated with heart morphogenesis and blood circulation including HTR2B were up-regulated. Genes associated with neurological system processes including NPY were up-regulated in UC-MSCs. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the gene expression data. And in vitro differentiation of MSCs demonstrated that CMSCs and UC-MSCs had a more pronounced ability to differentiate into cardiomyocyte and neural cells， respectively. This study firstly demonstrated the innate tissue-specific differentiation potency of perinatal MSCs which can be helpful in choosing more adequate cell sources for better outcome in a specific disease.
Oligomeric procyanidins stimulate innate antiviral immunity in dengue virus infected human PBMCs.,Antiviral Res, 2011 Apr,21371507,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21371507/,Oligomeric procyanidins (OPCs) have been shown to have antiviral and immunostimulatory effects. OPCs isolated from non-ripe apple peel were tested for capacity to reduce dengue virus (DENV) titers. Similar to published accounts， OPCs exhibited direct antiviral activity. The possibility of enhanced innate immune protection was also tested by measuring and characterizing gene and protein expression induced by OPCs during DENV infection. Treatment of DENV-infected human PBMCs with OPCs decreased viral titers and affected the expression of critical innate antiviral immune products. OPCs enhanced expression of MXI and IFNB transcripts in high MOI DENV infected PBMC cultures， and phosphorylation of STAT2 in response to recombinant type I IFN (IFN I). During low MOI infection， addition of OPCs increased expression of STAT1 transcripts， MHC I and TNFα protein production. Thus， OPCs exhibited innate immune stimulation of cells in DENV-infected cultures and uninfected cells treated with IFN I. While OPCs from a number of sources are known to exhibit antiviral effects， their mechanisms are not precisely defined. The capacity of OPCs to increase sensitivity to IFN I could be broadly applicable to many viral infections and two separate antiviral mechanisms suggest that OPCs may represent a novel， robust antiviral therapy.
Molecular features of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma unravels potential novel therapeutic targets.,Blood, 2012 Jun 14,22510872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22510872/,The pathogenesis of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL)， a rare entity mostly derived from γδ T cells and usually with a fatal outcome， remains largely unknown. In this study， HSTL samples (7γδ and 2αβ) and the DERL2 HSTL cell line were subjected to combined gene-expression profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Compared with other T-cell lymphomas， HSTL had a distinct molecular signature irrespective of TCR cell lineage. Compared with peripheral T-cell lymphoma， not otherwise specified and normal γδ T cells， HSTL overexpressed genes encoding NK-cell-associated molecules， oncogenes (FOS and VAV3)， the sphingosine-1-phosphatase receptor 5 involved in cell trafficking， and the tyrosine kinase SYK， whereas the tumor-suppressor gene AIM1 (absent in melanoma 1) was among the most down-expressed. We found highly methylated CpG islands of AIM1 in DERL2 cells， and decitabine treatment induced a significant increase in AIM1 transcripts. Syk was present in HSTL cells and DERL2 cells contained phosphorylated Syk and were sensitive to a Syk inhibitor in vitro. Genomic profiles confirmed recurrent isochromosome 7q (n = 6/9) without alterations at the SYK and AIM1 loci. Our results identify a distinct molecular signature for HSTL and highlight oncogenic pathways that offer rationale for exploring new therapeutic options such as Syk inhibitors and demethylating agents.
Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 expression controls cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition and radioresistance.,Cancer Sci, 2019 Apr,30801869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30801869/,Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is known to cause different expressions in normal and cancer cells. We observed a change in phenotype with the suppression of MPC expression. We knocked down MPC1 and/or MPC2 using siRNA or shRNA. We observed its cell morphology and accompanying molecular marker. Furthermore， the radioresistance of the MPC knockdown cell line was examined using a colony formation assay. MPC1-suppressed cells changed their morphology to a spindle shape. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was suspected， and examination of the EMT marker by PCR showed a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in fibronectin. Focusing on glutamine metabolism as the mechanism of this phenomenon， we knocked down the glutamine-metabolizing enzyme glutaminase (GLS). EMT was also observed in GLS-suppressed cells. Furthermore， when MPC1-suppressed cells were cultured in a glutamine-deficient medium， changes in EMT markers were suppressed. In addition， MPC1-suppressed cells also increased with a significant difference in radioresistance. Decreased MPC1 expression favorably affects EMT and radioresistance of cancer.Keywords:EMT; glutamine; metabolism; mitochondria pyruvate career; radiation therapy.
JNK inhibition blocks piperlongumine-induced cell death and transcriptional activation of heme oxygenase-1 in pancreatic cancer cells.,Apoptosis, 2019 Oct,31243599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31243599/,Piperlongumine (PL) is an alkaloid that inhibits glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) activity， resulting in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cancer-selective cell death. We aimed to identify stress-associated molecular responses to PL treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. GSTP1 directly interacts with JNK， which is activated by oxidative stress and can lead to decreased cancer cell proliferation and cell death. Therefore， we hypothesized that JNK pathways are activated in response to PL treatment. Our results show PL causes dissociation of GSTP1 from JNK; robust JNK， c-Jun， and early ERK activation followed by suppression; increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP; and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and c-Myc in PDAC cells. Gene expression analysis revealed PL caused a > 20-fold induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)， which we hypothesized was a survival mechanism for PDAC cells under enhanced oxidative stress. HO-1 knockout resulted in enhanced PL-induced PDAC cell death under hypoxic conditions. Similarly， high concentrations of the HO-1 inhibitor， ZnPP (10 µM)， sensitized PDAC cells to PL; however， lower concentrations ZnPP (10 nM) and high or low concentrations of SnPP both protected PDAC cells from PL-induced cell death. Interestingly， the JNK inhibitor significantly blocked PL-induced PDAC cell death， Nrf-2 nuclear translocation， and HMOX-1 mRNA expression. Collectively， the results demonstrate JNK signaling contributes to PL-induced PDAC cell death， and at the same time， activates Nrf-2 transcription of HMOX-1 as a compensatory survival mechanism. These results suggest that elevating oxidative stress (using PL) while at the same time impairing antioxidant capacity (inhibiting HO-1) may be an effective therapeutic approach for PDAC.Keywords:Apoptosis; GSTP1 inhibitor; Nrf2; Oxidative stress; SnPP; ZnPP.
Differential expression of APE1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and the effects on proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells.,Biosci Trends, 2018,30473552,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30473552/,This research aimed to investigate the differential expression of apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells and the effects on proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the expression of APE1 in 80 cases of HCC and the corresponding paracancerous tissue microarrays; meanwhile， Western blots were used to detect the expression of APE1 in both human HCC BEL-7402， BEL-7405， HCC-9204， Hep3B， HepG2， SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells， and normal hepatocyte L-02 cells. The relationship between APE1 expression and clinical pathological characteristics of HCC was statistically analyzed. APE1 shRNA vector was constructed in Hep 3B cells to establish a stably transfected cell line， using Western blots to determine the interference efficiency. Cell proliferation activity was detected with MTT assays， while apoptosis was detected with the Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeling technique. The expression of APE1 in HCC tissues and cells was significantly up-regulated， and its expression was significantly different from TNM staging and histopathological grading. Down-regulation of APE1 expression significantly reduced the proliferative activity and increased the apoptosis rate of Hep 3B cells. In conclusion， APE1 demonstrates cancer progression potential at the clinical， tissue and cell level. It provides a new idea and theoretical basis for APE1-based clinical diagnosis， prognosis determination and molecular targeted therapy in treatment of HCC.Keywords:APE1; apoptosis; cell proliferation; differential expression; hepatocellular carcinoma.
Spontaneous epithelial-mesenchymal transition and resistance to HER-2-targeted therapies in HER-2-positive luminal breast cancer.,PLoS One, 2013 Aug 26,23991019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23991019/,"Resistance to trastuzumab， a rationally designed HER-2-targeting antibody， remains a major hurdle in the management of HER-2-positive breast cancer. Preclinical studies suggest the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance are numerous. Unfortunately， the majority of these studies are based around HER-2-positive (HER-2+) luminal cell lines. The role of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)， a genetic program that confers a basal phenotype， may represent a novel mechanism of escape for HER-2+ luminal cells from trastuzumab treatment. Here we investigated this possibility using a model of clonal selection in HER-2+ luminal breast cancer cells. Following a random isolation and expansion of ""colony clusters"" from SKBR-3 cell lines， several colony clusters underwent a spontaneous EMT in-vitro. In addition to expression of conventional EMT markers， all mesenchymal colony clusters displayed a predominant CD44+/CD24- phenotype with decreased HER-2 expression and elevated levels of a β1-integrin isoform with a high degree of N-glycosylation. Treatment with a β1-integrin function-blocking antibody， AIIB2， preferentially decreased the N-glycosylated form of β1-integrin， impaired mammosphere formation and restored epithelial phenotype in mesenchymal colony clusters. Using this model we provide the first clear evidence that resistance to trastuzumab (and lapatinib) can occur spontaneously as HER-2+ cells shift from a luminal to a basal/mesenchymal phenotype following EMT. While the major determinant of trastuzumab resistance in mesenchymal colony clusters is likely the down regulation of the HER-2 protein， our evidence suggests that multiple factors may contribute， including expression of N-glycosylated β1-integrin."
Glutaminase 2 expression is associated with regional heterogeneity of 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence in glioblastoma.,Sci Rep, 2017 Sep 22,28939850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28939850/,Fluorescence-guided surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is now a widely-used modality for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. However， intratumoral heterogeneity of fluorescence intensity may reflect different onco-metabolic programs. Here， we investigated the metabolic mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of 5-ALA fluorescence in GBM. Using an in-house developed fluorescence quantification system for tumor tissues， we collected 3 types of GBM tissues on the basis of their fluorescence intensity， which was characterized as strong， weak， and none. Expression profiling by RNA-sequencing revealed 77 genes with a proportional relationship and 509 genes with an inverse relationship between gene expression and fluorescence intensity. Functional analysis and in vitro experiments confirmed glutaminase 2 (GLS2) as a key gene associated with the fluorescence heterogeneity. Subsequent metabolite profiling discovered that insufficient NADPH due to GLS2 underexpression was responsible for the delayed metabolism of 5-ALA and accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the high fluorescence area. The expression level of GLS2 and related NADPH production capacity is associated with the regional heterogeneity of 5-ALA fluorescence in GBM.
Molecular signatures of maturing dendritic cells: implications for testing the quality of dendritic cell therapies.,J Transl Med, 2010 Jan 15,20078880,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20078880/,Background:Dendritic cells (DCs) are often produced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation of monocytes. To improve the effectiveness of DC adoptive immune cancer therapy， many different agents have been used to mature DCs. We analyzed the kinetics of DC maturation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induction in order to characterize the usefulness of mature DCs (mDCs) for immune therapy and to identify biomarkers for assessing the quality of mDCs.Methods:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 6 healthy subjects by apheresis， monocytes were isolated by elutriation， and immature DCs (iDCs) were produced by 3 days of culture with GM-CSF and IL-4. The iDCs were sampled after 4， 8 and 24 hours in culture with LPS and IFN-gamma and were then assessed by flow cytometry， ELISA， and global gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis.Results:After 24 hours of LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation， DC surface expression of CD80， CD83， CD86， and HLA Class II antigens were up-regulated. Th1 attractant genes such as CXCL9， CXCL10， CXCL11 and CCL5 were up-regulated during maturation but not Treg attractants such as CCL22 and CXCL12. The expression of classical mDC biomarker genes CD83， CCR7， CCL5， CCL8， SOD2， MT2A， OASL， GBP1 and HES4 were up-regulated throughout maturation while MTIB， MTIE， MTIG， MTIH， GADD45A and LAMP3 were only up-regulated late in maturation. The expression of miR-155 was up-regulated 8-fold in mDCs.Conclusion:DCs， matured with LPS and IFN-gamma， were characterized by increased levels of Th1 attractants as opposed to Treg attractants and may be particularly effective for adoptive immune cancer therapy.
Apoptotic induction with bifunctional E.coli cytosine deaminase-uracil phosphoribosyltransferase mediated suicide gene therapy is synergized by curcumin treatment in vitro.,Mol Biotechnol, 2008 May,18092145,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18092145/,Development of novel suicide gene therapy vector with potential application in cancer treatment has a great impact on human health. Investigation to understand molecular mechanism of cell death is necessary to evaluate the therapeutic application of suicide vectors. For example， the bifunctional E.coli cytosine deaminase & uracil phosphoribosyltransferase fusion (CD-UPRT) gene expression is known to sensitize a wide range of cells toward nontoxic prodrug 5-flurocytosine (5-FC) by converting it to toxic compounds， but the exact pathway of cell death is yet to be defined. Herein， we investigated the mechanism of cell death by 5-FC/CD-UPRT suicide system in both cancer and non-cancer cells and found that the optimum 5-FC concentration led to programmed cell death in vitro. The CD-UPRT expression of transfected cells was measured by the RT-PCR analysis. Biochemical assays， such as mitochondrial activity (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurements exhibited cell death. Microscopic experiments showed characteristic onset of apoptosis which was further supported by internucleosomal DNA cleavage of BrdU labeled cellular DNA， appearance of characteristic laddering of chromosomal DNA and involvement of caspase pathway. Furthermore， the 5-FC/CD-UPRT-mediated apoptosis was potentiated with addition of a known anticancer agent curcumin. Our in vitro studies confirmed synergistic induction of apoptotic pathway in the combination treatment. Therefore， combination of 5-FC/CD-UPRT with curcumin could be a potential chemosensitization strategy for cancer treatment.
GADD45gamma: a new vitamin D-regulated gene that is antiproliferative in prostate cancer cells.,Endocrinology, 2010 Oct,20739400,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20739400/,1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1，25-(OH)2D3] inhibits proliferation of normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells at least in part through inhibition of G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. The mechanisms of the antiproliferative effects of 1，25-(OH)2D3 have yet to be fully elucidated but are known to require the vitamin D receptor. We previously developed a 1，25-(OH)2D3-resistant derivative of the human prostate cancer cell line， LNCaP， which retains active vitamin D receptors but is not growth inhibited by 1，25-(OH)2D3. Gene expression profiling revealed two novel 1，25-(OH)2D3-inducible genes， growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene gamma (GADD45γ) and mitogen induced gene 6 (MIG6)， in LNCaP but not in 1，25-(OH)2D3-resistant cells. GADD45γ up-regulation was associated with growth inhibition by 1，25-(OH)2D3 in human prostate cancer cells. Ectopic expression of GADD45γ in either LNCaP or ALVA31 cells resulted in G1 accumulation and inhibition of proliferation equal to or greater than that caused by 1，25-(OH)2D3 treatment. In contrast， ectopic expression of MIG6 had only minimal effects on cell cycle distribution and proliferation. Whereas GADD45γ has been shown to be induced by androgens in prostate cancer cells， up-regulation of GADD45γ by 1，25-(OH)2D3 was not dependent on androgen receptor signaling， further refuting a requirement for androgens/androgen receptor in vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition. These data introduce two novel 1，25-(OH)2D3-regulated genes and establish GADD45γ as a growth-inhibitory protein in prostate cancer. Furthermore， the induction of GADD45γ gene expression by 1，25-(OH)2D3 may mark therapeutic response in prostate cancer.
Parthenolide inhibits cancer stem-like side population of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via suppression of the NF-κB/COX-2 pathway.,Theranostics, 2015 Jan 1,25553117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25553117/,Cancer stem cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and contribute to both disease initiation and relapse. In this study， cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was found to regulate cancer stem-like side population cells of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and enhance cancer stem-like cells' characteristics such as higher colony formation efficiency and overexpression of stemness-associated genes. The regulatory effect of COX-2 on cancer stem-like characteristics may be mediated by ABCG2. COX-2 overexpression by a gain-of-function experiment increased the proportion of side population cells and their cancer stemness properties. The present study also demonstrated that in contrast to the classical chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil， which increased the proportion of side population cells and upregulated the expression of COX-2， parthenolide， a naturally occurring small molecule， preferentially targeted the side population cells of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and downregulated COX-2. Moreover， we found that the cancer stem-like cells' phenotype was suppressed by using COX-2 inhibitors NS-398 and CAY10404 or knocking down COX-2 with siRNA and shRNA. These findings suggest that COX-2 inhibition is the mechanism by which parthenolide induces cell death in the cancer stem-like cells of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In addition， parthenolide exhibited an inhibitory effect on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) nucler translocation by suppressing both the phosphorylation of IκB kinase complex and IκBα degradation. Taken together， these results suggest that parthenolide may exert its cancer stem cell-targeted chemotherapy through the NF-κB/COX-2 pathway.Keywords:cyclooxygenase-2; nasopharyngeal carcinoma; nuclear factor-kappa B; parthenolide; side population cells..
Linezolid for Infants and Toddlers With Disseminated Tuberculosis: First Steps.,Clin Infect Dis, 2016 Nov 1,27742638,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27742638/,Background:Infants and toddlers often present with disseminated and lymph node tuberculosis， in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is predominantly intracellular. Linezolid， used to treat tuberculosis in adults， has not been formally studied in infants. Infants clear linezolid 5 times faster than adults and achieve lower 0- to 24-hour area under the concentration-time curves (AUC0-24).Methods:To mimic intracellular disease， we infected human-derived THP-1 macrophages with Mtb and inoculated hollow fiber systems. We performed dose-effect and dose-scheduling studies in which we recapitulated the linezolid half-life of 3 hours encountered in infants. Repetitive sampling for linezolid pharmacokinetics， Mtb intracellular burden， viable monocyte count， and RNA sequencing reads were performed up to 28 days.Results:The linezolid extracellular half-life was 2.64 ± 0.38 hours， whereas intracellular half-life was 8.93 ± 1.30 hours (r2= 0.89). Linezolid efficacy was linked to the AUC0-24to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio (r2= 0.98). The exposure associated with maximal Mtb kill was an AUC0-24/MIC of 23.37 ± 1.16. We identified a 414-gene transcript on exposure to toxic linezolid doses. The largest number of genes mapped to ribosomal proteins， a signature hitherto not associated with linezolid toxicity. The second-largest number of differentially expressed genes mapped to mitochondrial enzyme inhibition. Linezolid AUC0-24best explained the mitochondrial gene inhibition， with 50% inhibition at 94 mg × hour/L (highest r2= 0.98).Conclusions:We identified the linezolid AUC0-24/MIC target for optimal efficacy against pediatric intracellular tuberculosis， and an AUC0-24threshold associated with mitochondrial inhibition. These constitute a therapeutic window to be targeted for optimal linezolid doses in children with tuberculosis.Keywords:RNA sequencing; disseminated tuberculosis; hollow fiber model; pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics; toxicity.
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat) represses androgen receptor expression and acts synergistically with an androgen receptor antagonist to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2007 Jan,17218635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17218635/,Growth of prostate cancer cells is initially dependent on androgens， and androgen ablation therapy is used to control tumor growth. Unfortunately， resistance to androgen ablation therapy inevitably occurs， and there is an urgent need for better treatments for advanced prostate cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors， such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat)， are promising agents for the treatment of a range of malignancies， including prostate cancer. SAHA inhibited growth of the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line at low micromolar concentrations and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis associated with chromatin condensation， DNA fragmentation， and mitochondrial membrane depolarization at higher concentrations (>/=5 mumol/L). Gene profiling and immunoblot analyses showed a decrease in androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein in LNCaP cells cultured with SAHA compared with control cells， with a corresponding decrease in levels of the AR-regulated gene， prostate-specific antigen. Culture of LNCaP cells in steroid-free medium markedly sensitized the cells to SAHA. Moreover， a combination of low， subeffective doses of SAHA and the AR antagonist bicalutamide resulted in a synergistic reduction in cell proliferation and increase in caspase-dependent cell death. Addition of exogenous androgen prevented the induction of cell death， indicating that suppression of androgen signaling was required for synergy. At the subeffective concentrations， these agents had no effect， alone or in combination， on proliferation or death of AR-negative PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Our findings indicate that SAHA is effective in targeting the AR signaling axis and that androgen deprivation sensitizes prostate cancer cells to SAHA. Consequently， combinatorial treatments that target different components of the AR pathway may afford a more effective strategy to control the growth of prostate cancer cells.

Gene expression response to cisplatin treatment in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.,Oncogene, 2007 May 3,17072341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17072341/,The molecular pathways activated in response to acute cisplatin exposure， as well as the mechanisms involved in the long-term development of cisplatin-resistant cancer cells remain unclear. Using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays， we have examined the kinetics of gene expression changes in a cisplatin-sensitive cell line， A2780， and its cisplatin-resistant derivative， ACRP. Both sensitive and resistant cell lines exhibited a very similar response of p53-inducible genes as early as 16 h after treatment. This p53 response was further increased at the 24-h time point. These experiments identify p53 as the main pathway producing a large-scale transcriptional response after cisplatin treatment in these cells containing wild-type p53. Consistent with a role for the p53 response in cisplatin sensitivity， knockdown of the p53 protein with small interfering RNA led to a twofold decrease in cell survival in the resistant cells. In addition， our analysis also allowed the identification of several genes that are differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cells. These genes include GJA1 (encoding connexin 43 (Cx43)) and TWIST1， which are highly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. The importance of Cx43 in drug resistance was demonstrated through functional analyses， although paradoxically， inhibition of Cx43 function in high expressing cells led to an increase in drug resistance. The pathways important in cisplatin response， as well as the genes found differentially expressed between cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cells， may represent targets for therapy aimed at reversing drug resistance.
Upregulation of mucin glycoprotein MUC1 in the progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma and therapeutic potential with a targeted photoactive antibody-drug conjugate.,Oncotarget, 2017 Apr 11,28212575,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28212575/,Background:Mucin glycoprotein 1 (MUC1) is a glycosylated transmembrane protein on epithelial cells. We investigate MUC1 as a therapeutic target in Barrett's epithelium (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and provide proof of concept for a light based therapy targeting MUC1.Results:MUC1 was present in 21% and 30% of significantly enriched pathways comparing BE and EA to squamous epithelium respectively. MUC1 gene expression was x2.3 and x2.2 higher in BE (p=<0.001) and EA (p=0.03). MUC1 immunohistochemical expression increased during progression to EA and followed tumor invasion. HuHMFG1 based photosensitive antibody drug conjugates (ADC) showed cell internalization， MUC1 selective and light-dependent cytotoxicity (p=0.0006) and superior toxicity over photosensitizer alone (p=0.0022).Methods:Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) evaluated pathways during BE and EA development and quantified MUC1 gene expression. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry evaluated the anti-MUC1 antibody HuHMFG1 in esophageal cells of varying pathological grade. Confocal microscopy examined HuHMFG1 internalization and HuHMFG1 ADCs were created to deliver a MUC1 targeted phototoxic payload.Conclusions:MUC1 is a promising target in EA. Molecular and light based targeting of MUC1 with a photosensitive ADC is effective in vitro and after development may enable treatment of locoregional tumors endoscopically.Keywords:Barrett’s esophagus; antibody-drug conjugate; esophageal adenocarcinoma; mucins; photodynamic therapy.
Expression profiles of E/P receptors and fibrosis in GnRHa-treated and -untreated women with different uterine leiomyomas.,PLoS One, 2020 Nov 13,33186388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33186388/,Differential expressions of estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and individual component of extracellular matrices derived from fibroid are reported. Information on the pattern of change in ER/PR expression and amount of tissue fibrosis after hormonal treatment is unclear. We investigated pattern of change in ER/PR expression and percentage of tissue fibrosis in different uterine leiomyomas after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment. Biopsy specimens from fibroids and adjacent myometria were collected after surgery from women with submucosal myoma (SMM， n = 18)， intramural myoma (IMM， n = 16) and subserosal myoma (SSM， n = 17). A proportion of women in each group of fibroid underwent treatment with GnRHa for a variable period of 3-6 months. Tissue expression of ER and PR was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In vitro cell proliferation effect of GnRHa on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was examined. Distribution of tissue fibrosis was examined by Masson's trichrome staining with computer-captured image analysis of fibrosis derived from different types of fibroid. PR content was significantly higher than ER in tissues derived from GnRHa-untreated women with SMM and SSM (p = 0.04 for both). Comparing to untreated group， GnRHa-treatment significantly decreased either ER or PR expression in different fibroids. Exogenous treatment with GnRHa dose-dependently decreased proliferation of HUVECs. No significant difference was observed in the percentage of fibrosis in tissues collected from GnRHa-treated and -untreated women with fibroids. The distribution of fibrosis in myoma/myometria and occurrence of fibrosis in perivascular area showed an increasing trend with higher age of the women and with larger size of fibroids. Our findings suggest that despite estrogen dependency， higher PR content in GnRHa-untreated group may indicate a potential role of progesterone in leiomyoma growth. Although GnRHa therapy may shrink fibroids and reduce risk of bleeding during surgery， the occurrence of diffuse tissue fibrosis may impair effective reduction of fibroid size after hormonal treatment.

Long-term exposure to gefitinib induces acquired resistance through DNA methylation changes in the EGFR-mutant PC9 lung cancer cell line.,Int J Oncol, 2015 Jan,25353970,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25353970/,This study was designed to identify epigenetically regulated genes and to clarify the contribution of epige-netic alteration to acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor‑tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR‑TKIs). We established a gefitinib‑resistant lung cancer cell line， PC9， which was originally gefitinib‑sensitive， by serial long‑term exposure to gefitinib. RNA and DNA were collected from both gefitinib‑sensitive and ‑resistant PC9 cells， and comprehensive DNA methylation and mRNA expression analyses were performed using Infinium HumanMethylation27 Bead Arrays and Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K Array， respectively. DNA methylation was increased in 640 genes in gefitinib‑resistant cells compared to parental cells. Among them， we selected 29 candidate genes that presented a decrease in mRNA expression in resistant PC9. We further studied four of the selected genes (C10orf116， IGFBP3， KL， and S100P) and found that KL or S100P silencing by siRNA induced a decrease in gefitinib sensitivity compared to that in the negative control in PC9. In conclusion， KL and S100P could be potential targets to overcome resistance to EGFR‑TKIs.
Engineered insulin secretion from neuroendocrine cells isolated from human thyroid.,World J Surg, 2014 Jun,24549997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549997/,Background:Insulin-secreting beta-like cells are vulnerable to diabetic autoimmunity. We hypothesized that human thyroid neuroendocrine (NE) cells could be engineered to secrete human insulin， be glucose-responsive， and avoid autoimmunity.Methods:Collagenase-digested thyroid tissue was cultured and subjected to size-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Insulin secretion and storage in NE cells transduced with viral vectors carrying an insulin sequence was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunogold transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Baseline mRNA expression was assessed by Illumina expression array analysis. Transduction with retrovirus expressing transcription factors PDX1， NGN3， MAFA， or HNF6 altered mRNA expression in a custom polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) in conditioned medium and cell lysates was determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR， ELISA， and immunohistochemistry.Results:Isolation yielded an average of 2.2 × 10(6) cells/g thyroid tissue， which stained for calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related protein， expressed genes consistent with NE origins， and secreted GRP. Transduced cells secreted 56 % and retained 48 % of total insulin produced. Immunogold TEM revealed insulin in secretory vesicles. PDX1， NGN3， and MAFA overexpression increased expression of genes typical for hepatocytes and beta cells. Overexpression of HNF6 also increased the message of genes critical for glucose sensing.Conclusions:Human thyroid NE cells can produce human insulin， fractions of which are both secreted and retained in secretory granules. Overexpression of HNF6， PDX1， or NGN3 enhances expression of both hepatocyte and beta cell typical mRNAs， including the message of proteins critical for glucose sensing. These data suggest that reimplantation of engineered autologous NE cells may develop as a viable treatment for diabetes mellitus type 1.

A comprehensive analysis of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related genes and crosstalk pathways in the treatment of As2O3 in renal cancer.,Ren Fail, 2018 Nov,29633893,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29633893/,We aimed to investigate the effect of As2O3treatment on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related genes and pathways in renal cancer. Illumina-based RNA-seq of 786-O cells with or without As2O3treatment was performed， and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Cuffdiff software. TargetMine was utilized to perform Gene Ontology (GO) pathway and Disease Ontology enrichment analyses. Furthermore， TRANSFAC database and LPIA method were applied to select differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) and pathways related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway， respectively. Additionally， transcriptional regulatory and pathway crosstalk networks were constructed. In total， 1684 DEGs and 69 TFs were screened out. The 821 up-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in 67 pathways， 70 GO terms， and 46 disease pathways， while only 1 pathway and 5 GO terms were enriched for 863 down-regulated DEGs. A total of 18 DEGs (4 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated genes) were involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Among the 18 DEGs， 4 ones were TFs. Furthermore， 211 pathways were predicted to be linked to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion， As2O3may have a significant effect on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for renal cancer treatment. The potential key DEGs are expected to be used as therapeutic targets.Keywords:As2O3; Wnt signaling pathway; differentially expressed gene; renal cancer; therapeutic targets.
DNA damage induces GDNF secretion in the tumor microenvironment with paracrine effects promoting prostate cancer treatment resistance.,Oncotarget, 2015 Feb 10,25575823,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25575823/,Though metastatic cancers often initially respond to genotoxic therapeutics， acquired resistance is common. In addition to cytotoxic effects on tumor cells， DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapy induce injury in benign cells of the tumor microenvironment resulting in the production of paracrine-acting factors capable of promoting tumor resistance phenotypes. In studies designed to characterize the responses of prostate and bone stromal cells to genotoxic stress， we found that transcripts encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) increased several fold following exposures to cytotoxic agents including radiation， the topoisomerase inhibitor mitoxantrone and the microtubule poison docetaxel. Fibroblast GDNF exerted paracrine effects toward prostate cancer cells resulting in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and invasion， and these effects were concordant with the expression of known GDNF receptors GFRA1 and RET. Exposure to GDNF also induced tumor cell resistance to mitoxantrone and docetaxel chemotherapy. Together， these findings support an important role for tumor microenvironment damage responses in modulating treatment resistance and identify the GDNF signaling pathway as a potential target for improving responses to conventional genotoxic therapeutics.

The Role of microRNAs in Cholangiocarcinoma.,Int J Mol Sci, 2021 Jul 16,34299246,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34299246/,Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)， an aggressive malignancy， is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage. It is associated with dismal 5-year postoperative survival rates， generating an urgent need for prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that are associated with cancer regulation， including modulation of cell cycle progression， apoptosis， metastasis， angiogenesis， autophagy， therapy resistance， and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Several miRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in CCA and are associated with CCA-related risk factors. Accumulating studies have indicated that the expression of altered miRNAs could act as oncogenic or suppressor miRNAs in the development and progression of CCA and contribute to clinical diagnosis and prognosis prediction as potential biomarkers. Furthermore， miRNAs and their target genes also contribute to targeted therapy development and aid in the determination of drug resistance mechanisms. This review aims to summarize the roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of CCA， their potential use as biomarkers of diagnosis and prognosis， and their utilization as novel therapeutic targets in CCA.Keywords:cholangiocarcinoma; diagnostic biomarker; microRNA; prognostic biomarker.

Additional clues for a protective role of vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases: 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 triggers an anti-inflammatory response in brain pericytes.,J Alzheimers Dis, 2014,24934545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24934545/,Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1，25D) plays a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Most of the experimental data regarding the genes regulated by this hormone in brain cells have been obtained with neuron and glial cells. Pericytes play a critical role in brain function that encompasses their classical function in blood-brain barrier control and maintenance. However， the gene response of brain pericyte to 1，25D remains to be investigated. Analyses of the transcriptomic response of human brain pericytes to 1，25D demonstrate that human brain pericytes in culture respond to 1，25D by regulating genes involved in the control of neuroinflammation. In addition， pericytes respond to the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and Interferon-γ by inducing the expression of the CYP27B1 gene which is involved in 1，25D synthesis. Taken together， these results suggest that neuroinflammation could trigger the synthesis of 1，25D by brain pericytes， which in turn respond to the hormone by a global anti-inflammatory response. These findings identify brain pericytes as a novel 1，25D-responsive cell type and provide additional evidence for the potential value of vitamin D in the prevention or therapy of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric diseases associated with an inflammatory component.Keywords:Alzheimer's disease; dementia; inflammation; intracrine; neurodegenerative diseases; pericyte; vitamin D.

Characterization of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent deaths in glioblastoma cells treated with inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2009 Nov,19887551,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19887551/,The regulation of the necrotic death and its relevance in anticancer therapy are largely unknown. Here， we have investigated the proapoptotic and pronecrotic activities of two ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitors: bortezomib and G5. The present study points out that the glioblastoma cell lines U87MG and T98G are useful models to study the susceptibility to apoptosis and necrosis in response to ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitors. U87MG cells show resistance to apoptosis induced by bortezomib and G5， but they are more susceptible to necrosis induced by G5. Conversely， T98G cells are more susceptible to apoptosis induced by both inhibitors but show some resistance to G5-induced necrosis. No overt differences in the induction of Noxa and Mcl-1 or in the expression levels of other components of the apoptotic machinery were observed between U87MG and T98G cells. Instead， by comparing the transcriptional profiles of the two cell lines， we have found that the resistance to G5-induced necrosis could arise from differences in glutathione synthesis/utilization and in the microenvironment. In particular， collagen IV， which is highly expressed in T98G cells， and fibronectin， whose adhesive function is counteracted by tenascin-C in U87MG cells， can restrain the necrotic response to G5. Collectively， our results provide an initial characterization of the molecular signals governing cell death by necrosis in glioblastoma cell lines.

Effects of 1alpha，25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 and testosterone on miRNA and mRNA expression in LNCaP cells.,Mol Cancer, 2011 May 18,21592394,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21592394/,Background:There is evidence from epidemiological and in vitro studies that the biological effects of testosterone (T) on cell cycle and survival are modulated by 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1，25(OH)2D3) in prostate cancer. To investigate the cross talk between androgen- and vitamin D-mediated intracellular signaling pathways， the individual and combined effects of T and 1，25(OH)2D3 on global gene expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells were assessed.Results:Stringent statistical analysis identifies a cohort of genes that lack one or both androgen response elements (AREs) or vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in their promoters， which are nevertheless differentially regulated by both steroids (either additively or synergistically). This suggests that mechanisms in addition to VDR- and AR-mediated transcription are responsible for the modulation of gene expression. Microarray analysis shows that fifteen miRNAs are also differentially regulated by 1，25(OH)2D3 and T. Among these miR-22， miR-29ab， miR-134， miR-1207-5p and miR-371-5p are up regulated， while miR-17 and miR-20a， members of the miR-17/92 cluster are down regulated. A number of genes implicated in cell cycle progression， lipid synthesis and accumulation and calcium homeostasis are among the mRNA targets of these miRNAs. Thus， in addition to their well characterized effects on transcription， mediated by either or both cognate nuclear receptors， 1，25(OH)2D3 and T regulate the steady state mRNA levels by modulating miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation， generating attenuation feedback loops that result in global changes in mRNA and protein levels. Changes in genes involved in calcium homeostasis may have specific clinical importance since the second messenger Ca2+ is known to modulate various cellular processes， including cell proliferation， cell death and cell motility， which affects prostate cancer tumor progression and responsiveness to therapy.Conclusions:These data indicate that these two hormones combine to drive a differentiated phenotype， and reinforce the idea that the age dependent decline in both hormones results in the de-differentiation of prostate tumor cells， which results in increased proliferation， motility and invasion common to aggressive tumors. These studies also reinforce the potential importance of miRNAs in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes.
Genome-wide analysis of aromatase inhibitor-resistant， tamoxifen-resistant， and long-term estrogen-deprived cells reveals a role for estrogen receptor.,Cancer Res, 2008 Jun 15,18559539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18559539/,quired resistance to either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AI) develops after prolonged treatment in a majority of hormone-responsive breast cancers. In an attempt to further elucidate mechanisms of acquired resistance to AIs， MCF-7aro cells resistant to letrozole (T+LET R)， anastrozole (T+ANA R)， and exemestane (T+EXE R)， as well as long-term estrogen deprived (LTEDaro) and tamoxifen-resistant (T+TAM R) lines were generated. This is the first complete panel of endocrine therapy-resistant cell lines， which were generated as multiple independent biological replicates for unbiased genome-wide analysis using affymetrix microarrays. Although similarities are apparent， microarray results clearly show gene signatures unique to AI-resistance were inherently different from LTEDaro and T+TAM R gene expression profiles. Based on hierarchical clustering， unique estrogen-responsive gene signatures vary depending on cell line， with some genes up-regulated in all lines versus other genes up-regulated only in the AI-resistant lines. Characterization of these resistant lines showed that LTEDaro， T+LET R， and T+ANA R cells contained a constitutively active estrogen receptor (ER)alpha that does not require estrogen for activation. This ligand-independent activation of ER was not observed in the parental cells， as well as T+EXE R and T+TAM R cells. Further characterization of these resistant lines was performed using cell cycle analysis， immunofluorescence experiments to visualize ER subcellular localization， as well as cross-resistance studies to determine second-line inhibitor response. Using this well-defined model system， our studies provide important information regarding differences in resistance mechanisms to AIs， TAM， and LTEDaro， which are critical in overcoming resistance when treating hormone-responsive breast cancers.
Modulation of gene expression in human macrophages treated with the anti-leishmania pentavalent antimonial drug sodium stibogluconate.,Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2008 Feb,18070969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18070969/,Within the mammalian host， Leishmania donovani is an obligatory intracellular protozoan parasite that resides and multiplies exclusively in the phagolysosomes of macrophages. Leishmania control relies primarily on chemotherapy， with the mainstay being pentavalent antimony (SbV) complexed to carbohydrates in the form of sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) or meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime). The mode of action of SbV is still not known precisely. To explore the effect of SbV on macrophage gene expression， a microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix focus arrays to compare gene expression profiles in noninfected and L. donovani-infected THP-1 monocytic cells treated or not treated with sodium stibogluconate. Under our experimental conditions， SbV changed the expression of a few host genes， and this was independent of whether cells were infected or not infected with Leishmania. Leishmania infection had a greater effect on the modulation of host gene expression. Statistical analyses have indicated that the expression of eight genes was modified by at least twofold upon SbV treatment， with six genes upregulated and two genes downregulated. One gene whose expression was affected by SbV was the heme oxygenase gene HMOX-1， and this change was observed both in the monocytic cell line THP-1 and in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Another pathway that was affected was the glutathione biosynthesis pathway， where the expression of the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit was increased upon SbV treatment. Our analysis has suggested that， under our experimental conditions， the expression of a few genes is altered upon SbV treatment， and some of these encoded proteins may be implicated in the yet-to-be-defined mode of action of SbV.
LncRNA HHIP-AS1 suppresses lung squamous cell carcinoma by stabilizing HHIP mRNA.,Life Sci, 2023 May 15,36958438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36958438/,ims:Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) causes over 400，000 deaths annually， yet it lacks targeted therapy. A major antagonist of Hedgehog pathway， HHIP (Hedgehog Interacting Protein) plays an important role in LUSC; however， the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Long non-coding RNA HHIP-AS1 plays suppressive or promotive roles in different cancers， but its role in LUSC remains unknown. This manuscript is to investigate regulatory mechanism of HHIP and the role of HHIP-AS1 in LUSC.Main methods:Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from human LUSC samples are cultured to mimic LUSC growth. Overexpression and knockdown in multiple LUSC cell lines and PCLS are achieved by lentivirus infection. Transcriptome profile and lung cancer activity are evaluated by RNA-sequencing， immunostaining and CCK8 assay etc. KEY FINDINGS: HHIP is regulated independently of Hh pathway in LUSC. Additionally， downregulation of HHIP-AS1 is associated with poor prognosis. Consistently， HHIP-AS1 inhibits LUSC growth by suppressing cell proliferation and migration. Transcriptome profiling of HHIP-AS1 knockdown (KD) cells uncovered HHIP downregulation. Interestingly， a comparison between the transcriptomes of HHIP-AS1 KD or HHIP KD cells manifested high similarity. Subsequently it's confirmed that HHIP-AS1 regulates HHIP in LUSC cells. Notably， HHIP-AS1 regulation on LUSC growth is achieved through stabilizing HHIP mRNA rather than regulating MIR-153-3P/PCDHGA9 or MIR-425-5P/DNYC1I2. Finally， it's confirmed in PCLS from human LUSC samples that HHIP-AS1 suppresses LUSC via regulating HHIP mRNA.Significance:This study uncovers HHIP-AS1 as a novel tumor suppressor in LUSC and provides new insights into the molecular regulation of LUSC， which will help developing new therapeutic strategies.Keywords:HHIP; HHIP-AS1; LUSC; PCLS.
Research resource: Transcriptional profiling in a cellular model of breast cancer reveals functional and mechanistic differences between clinically relevant SERM and between SERM/estrogen complexes.,Mol Endocrinol, 2012 Jul,22570330,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22570330/,Exploitation of the relationship between estrogen receptor (ER) structure and activity has led to the development of 1) selective ER modulators (SERM)， compounds whose relative agonist/antagonist activities differ between target tissues; 2) selective ER degraders (SERD)， compounds that induce a conformational change in the receptor that targets it for proteasomal degradation; and 3) tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSEC)， drugs in which a SERM and an ER agonist are combined to yield a blended activity that results in distinct clinical profiles. In this study， we have performed a comprehensive head-to-head analysis of the transcriptional activity of these different classes of ERM in a cellular model of breast cancer. Not surprisingly， these studies highlighted important functional differences and similarities among the existing SERM， selective ER degraders， and TSEC. Of particular importance was the identification of genes that were regulated by various TSEC combinations but not by an estrogen or SERM alone. Cumulatively， the findings of this analysis are informative with respect to the mechanisms by which ER is engaged by different enhancers/promoters and highlights how promoter context influences the pharmacological activity of ER ligands.
Ras inhibition in glioblastoma down-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha， causing glycolysis shutdown and cell death.,Cancer Res, 2005 Feb 1,15705901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15705901/,ive Ras and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent pathways contribute to the malignant phenotype of glioblastoma multiformes (GBM). Here we show that the Ras inhibitor trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) exhibits profound antioncogenic effects in U87 GBM cells. FTS inhibited active Ras and attenuated Ras signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase， phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase， and Akt. Concomitantly， hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) disappeared， expression of key glycolysis pathway enzymes and of other HIF-1alpha-regulated genes (including vascular endothelial growth factor and the Glut-1 glucose transporter) was down-regulated， and glycolysis was halted. This led to a dramatic reduction in ATP， resulting in a severe energy crisis. In addition， the expression of E2F-regulated genes was down-regulated in the FTS-treated cells. Consequently， U87 cell growth was arrested and the cells died. These results show that FTS is a potent down-regulator of HIF-1alpha and might therefore block invasiveness， survival， and angiogenesis in GBM.
MicroRNA-141 inhibits tumor growth and minimizes therapy resistance in colorectal cancer.,Mol Med Rep, 2017 Mar,28112364,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28112364/,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of most common cancers and causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide， due to its recurrence， metastasis and therapy resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been demonstrated to be vital for tumor initiation and recurrence. microRNAs may act as an oncogenes or tumor suppressors in numerous cancers. The present study demonstrated that microRNA-141 (miR‑141) was downregulated in CSC compared with differentiated cancer cells， and in tumor compared with healthy tissue. miR‑141 may inhibit CRC cell proliferation and the maintenance of CSC stemness， thereby enhancing drug susceptibility. In addition， the present study identified cyclin D2 as a novel target gene of miR‑141. In conclusion， the antitumor role of miR‑141 and its target cyclin D2 may suggest the development of miR‑141 as a potential therapeutic agent.
An Extract of Transgenic Senna obtusifolia L. Hairy Roots with Overexpression of PgSS1 Gene in Combination with Chemotherapeutic Agent Induces Apoptosis in the Leukemia Cell Line.,Biomolecules, 2020 Mar 27,32230928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32230928/,Many biologically-active plant-derived compounds have therapeutic or chemopreventive effects. The use of plant in vitro cultures in conjunction with modern genetic engineering techniques allows greater amounts of valuable secondary metabolites to be obtained without interfering with the natural environment. This work presents the first findings concerning the acquisition of transgenic hairy roots ofSenna obtusifoliaoverexpressing the gene encoding squalene synthase 1 fromPanax ginseng(PgSS1) (SOPSS hairy loot lines) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Our results confirm that one of PgSS1-overexpressing hairy root line extracts (SOPSS2) possess a high cytotoxic effect against a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NALM6) cell line. Further analysis of the cell cycle， the expression of apoptosis-related genes (TP53， PUMA， NOXA， BAX) and the observed decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential also confirmed that the SOPSS2 hairy root extract displays the highest effects; similar results were also obtained for this extract combined with doxorubicin. The high cytotoxic activity， observed both alone or in combination with doxorubicin， may be due to the higher content of betulinic acid as determined by HPLC analysis. Our results suggest synergistic effects of tested extract (betulinic acid in greater amount) with doxorubicin which may be used in the future to develop new effective strategies of cancer chemosensitization.Keywords:NALM6 leukemia cell line; Senna obtusifolia; anticancer properties; betulinic acid; transgenic hairy roots.
Dual targeting of bromodomain-containing 4 by AZD5153 and BCL2 by AZD4320 against B-cell lymphomas concomitantly overexpressing c-MYC and BCL2.,Invest New Drugs, 2019 Apr,29931583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29931583/,Despite the recent therapeutic progress， the prognoses of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) that concomitantly overexpress c-MYC and BCL2， i.e.， double hit lymphoma (DHL) and double expressing lymphoma (DEL)， remain poor. This study examined triple targeting of c-MYC， BCL2 and the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway for DHL and DEL. We first used AZD5153， a novel bivalent inhibitor for bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4)， in DHL- and DEL-derived cell lines， because BRD4 regulates disease type-oriented key molecules for oncogenesis. AZD5153 was more effective than conventional monovalent BRD4 inhibitors， JQ1 and I-BET151， in inhibiting cell proliferation of a DHL-derived cell line and two DEL-derived cell lines， with at least 10-fold lower half growth inhibitory concentrations. AZD5153 caused G1/S cell cycle blockade， while the apoptosis-inducing effect was relatively modest. At the molecular level， AZD5153 was potent in downregulating various molecules for oncogenesis， such as c-MYC， AKT2 and MAP3K; those involved in the BCR signaling pathway， such as CD19， BLNK and CD79B; and those associated with B-cell development， such as IKZF1， IKZF3， PAX5， POU2AF1 and EBF1. In contrast， AZD5153 did not decrease anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins， and did not activate pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins， except BAD. To augment cell death induction， we added a novel BH3-mimicking BCL2 inhibitor AZD4320 to AZD5153， and found that these two agents had a mostly synergistic antitumor effect by increasing cells undergoing apoptosis in all three cell lines. These results provide a rationale for dual targeting of BRD4 and BCL2 using AZD5153 and AZD4320 as a therapeutic strategy against DHL and DEL.Keywords:AZD5153; BCL2; BH3-mimetic; BRD4 inhibitor; C-MYC.
Differences in global gene expression in melanoma cell lines with and without homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus genes.,Melanoma Res, 2006 Aug,16845325,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16845325/,We studied differential global gene expression in four melanoma cell lines with three cell lines without homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus using HG-U133A microarrays with 22 277 transcripts. None of the cell lines carried mutations in the B-RAF and N-RAS genes. Data analysis using stringent criteria showed specific upregulation of 70 genes and downregulation of 86 genes in cell lines with homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene. A comparison with previous expression data showed overlapping of upregulation and downregulation of seven and 23 genes， respectively， in melanoma cell lines with homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus or mutations in the B-RAF and N-RAS genes. Microarray data for eight selected genes were validated with an extended number of cell lines using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The upregulated genes in cell lines with the deletion besides others included MAGE A2 [fold change 128， 95% confidence interval (CI) 82.8-172.2; t-test P=0.004]， MAGE A6 (fold change 623， 95% CI 473.4-772.1; t-test P=0.001)， MAGE A12 (fold change 90， 95% CI 65.1-115.5; t-test P=0.001) and dopachrome tautomerase (fold change 42， 95% CI 32.5-51.8; t-test P=0.001). Downregulated genes included interleukin 18 (fold change 489， 95% CI 146.4-831.2; t-test P=0.04)， ID2 (fold change 3， 95% CI 2.2-4.9; t-test P=0.001)， KLF4 (fold change 9， 95% CI 4.3-14.7; P=0.01) and CD24 antigen (fold change 1308， 95% CI 766.0-1850.8; t-test P=0.01). The upregulated genes common to cell lines with homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene and mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS gene included those that are involved in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways. Our results highlight effects of homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A locus on global gene expression.
Characterization of the origin recognition complex (ORC) from a higher plant， rice (Oryza sativa L.).,Gene, 2005 Jun 20,15939553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15939553/,The origin recognition complex (ORC) protein plays a critical role in DNA replication through binding to sites (origins) where replication commences. The protein is composed of six subunits (ORC1 to 6) in animals and yeasts. Our knowledge of the ORC protein in plants is， however， much less complete. We have performed cDNA cloning and characterization of ORC subunits in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) in order to facilitate study of plant DNA replication mechanisms. Our previous report provided a description of a gene， ORC1 (OsORC1)， that encodes one of the protein subunits. The present report extends this initial analysis to include the genes that encode four other rice ORC subunits， OsORC2， 3， 4 and 5. Northern hybridization analyses demonstrated the presence of abundant transcripts for all OsORC subunits in shoot apical meristems (SAM) and cultured cells， but not in mature leaves. Interestingly， only OsORC5 showed high levels of expression in organs in which cell proliferation is not active， such as flag leaves， the ears and the non-tip roots. The pattern of expression of OsORC2 also differed from other OsORC subunits. When cell proliferation was temporarily halted for 6-10 days by removal of sucrose from the growth medium， expression of OsORC1， OsORC3， OsORC4 and OsORC5 was substantially reduced. However， the level of expression of OsORC2 remained constant. We suggest from these results that expression of OsORC1， 3， 4 and 5 are correlated with cell proliferation， but the expression of OsORC2 is not.
Model-driven discovery of long-chain fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in heterogeneous prostate cancer cells.,PLoS Comput Biol, 2018 Jan 2,29293497,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29293497/,Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity， by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model， PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential， while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria， PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis， cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid， a long-chain fatty acid with antiproliferative effects. The potential therapeutic significance of our model was supported by a differential sensitivity of PC-3/M cells to etomoxir， an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid transport to the mitochondria.
Fast and efficient neural conversion of human hematopoietic cells.,Stem Cell Reports, 2014 Dec 9,25458894,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458894/,Neurons obtained directly from human somatic cells hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening. Available protocols rely on overexpression of transcription factors using integrative vectors and are often slow， complex， and inefficient. We report a fast and efficient approach for generating induced neural cells (iNCs) directly from human hematopoietic cells using Sendai virus. Upon SOX2 and c-MYC expression， CD133-positive cord blood cells rapidly adopt a neuroepithelial morphology and exhibit high expansion capacity. Under defined neurogenic culture conditions， they express mature neuronal markers and fire spontaneous action potentials that can be modulated with neurotransmitters. SOX2 and c-MYC are also sufficient to convert peripheral blood mononuclear cells into iNCs. However， the conversion process is less efficient and resulting iNCs have limited expansion capacity and electrophysiological activity upon differentiation. Our study demonstrates rapid and efficient generation of iNCs from hematopoietic cells while underscoring the impact of target cells on conversion efficiency.
mRNA and microRNA expression profiles of radioresistant NCI-H520 non-small cell lung cancer cells.,Mol Med Rep, 2015 Aug,25873351,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25873351/,To elucidate the mechanism of radioresistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and to identify key molecules conferring radioresistance， the radioresistant subclone NCI-H520/R， derived from the NCI-H520 NSCLC cell line， was established with eight rounds of sublethal irradiation. The radioresistant features were subsequently assessed using a clonogenic assay， analysis of apoptosis and an MTT assay， the gene expression levels were examined using an Agilent Whole Human Genome 4 x 44 k Oligo microarray and Agilent Human miRCURY(™) LNA array， and confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were performed to determine the biological functions of the subset of differentially expressed genes. miRNA-mRNA correlation analysis between the expression levels of each miRNA and all its predicted target genes was performed to further understand the radioresistance in the NCI-H520 cells. Following eight rounds of sublethal irradiation， a total of 2，862 mRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the NCI-H520/R cells， including 893 upregulated genes and 1，969 downregulated genes. A total of 162 upregulated miRNAs and 274 downregulated miRNAs were significantly deregulated in the NCI-H520/R cells. Multiple core regulatory processes and signaling pathways were identified as being of likely relevance to radioresistance in NCI-H520/R cells， including the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and neurotrophin signaling pathway. The expression of genes associated with radioresistance reflects the complex biological processes involved in clinical cancer cell eradication and requires further investigation for future enhancement of therapy.
Redirecting cell-type specific cytokine responses with engineered interleukin-4 superkines.,Nat Chem Biol, 2012 Dec,23103943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23103943/,Cytokines dimerize their receptors， with the binding of the 'second chain' triggering signaling. In the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 system， different cell types express varying numbers of alternative second receptor chains (γc or IL-13Rα1)， forming functionally distinct type I or type II complexes. We manipulated the affinity and specificity of second chain recruitment by human IL-4. A type I receptor-selective IL-4 'superkine' with 3，700-fold higher affinity for γc was three- to ten-fold more potent than wild-type IL-4. Conversely， a variant with high affinity for IL-13Rα1 more potently activated cells expressing the type II receptor and induced differentiation of dendritic cells from monocytes， implicating the type II receptor in this process. Superkines showed signaling advantages on cells with lower second chain numbers. Comparative transcriptional analysis reveals that the superkines induce largely redundant gene expression profiles. Variable second chain numbers can be exploited to redirect cytokines toward distinct cell subsets and elicit new actions， potentially improving the selectivity of cytokine therapy.
MN1 affects expression of genes involved in hematopoiesis and can enhance as well as inhibit RAR/RXR-induced gene expression.,Carcinogenesis, 2008 Oct,18632758,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18632758/,The oncoprotein meningioma 1 (MN1) is overexpressed in several subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and overexpression was associated with a poor response to chemotherapy. MN1 is a cofactor of retinoic acid receptor/retinoic x receptor (RAR/RXR)-mediated transcription and this study identified genes in the promonocytic cell line U937 that were regulated by MN1. We found that MN1 can both stimulate and inhibit transcription. Combining MN1 expression with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)， the ligand of the RAR/RXR dimer， showed that MN1 could both enhance and repress ATRA effects. Many of the identified genes are key players in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis (e.g. MEIS1 and BMI1). Another interesting target is DHRS9. DHRS9 is involved in the synthesis of ATRA from vitamin A. MN1 inhibited DHRS9 expression and completely abolished its induction by ATRA. MN1 is also the target of a rare AML-causing translocation encoding the MN1-TEL protein. MN1-TEL induces expression of only a few genes and its most pronounced effect is inhibition of a large group of ATRA-induced genes including DHRS9. In conclusion， both MN1 and MN1-TEL interfere with the ATRA pathway and this might explain the differentiation block in leukemias in which these genes are involved.
KRAS NF-κB is involved in the development of zinc resistance and reduced curability in prostate cancer.,Metallomics, 2014 Jul,24927480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24927480/,Zinc(II) ions are important components of many proteins and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as apoptosis or drug resistance. Prostate cancer has a unique relationship with zinc(II) ions. However， the relationship was examined only in short-term zinc(II) treatments. Therefore， the aim of this study was to create zinc-resistant prostatic cell lines at various stages of the disease (22Rv1 and PC-3) and a normal prostate epithelium (PNT1A) using a long-term zinc exposure. Consequently， the expression profile of the following genes was analyzed: BAX， Bcl-2， Beclin-1， CFLAR， HIF1α， KRAS， mTOR， MT1A， MT2A， NF-κB1， p53， survivin， ZIP1， ZnT-1. The resistance was verified using the MTT test; on average a 1.35-fold lower zinc(II) toxicity (higher IC50) was determined in zinc(II)-resistant cells. The associated resistance to cisplatin was also determined; IC50 for cisplatin was 1.52-fold higher. With regard to the gene expression profiles， our results indicate that differential mechanisms participate in the short-term zinc toxicity regulation and long-term resistance; the short-term treatment was associated with MT2A (p < 0.001)， ZnT-1 (p < 0.001)， and MT1A (p < 0.03) and the long-term resistance was associated particularly with NF-κB1 (p < 0.001)， CFLAR (p < 0.001)， KRAS (p < 0.001)， p53 (p < 0.002)， survivin (p = 0.02)， ZIP1 (p = 0.002)， BAX (p = 0.005)， and HIF1α (p = 0.05). Therefore， the KRAS-PI3K-NF-κB pathway is expected to play a crucial role in the regulation of zinc resistance. In summary， compared to previous studies， identical mechanisms of resistance were demonstrated on multiple cell lines， both non-tumor and tumorous， derived both from primary and advanced secondary sites.
Tamoxifen alleviates hepatitis C virus-induced inhibition of both toll-like receptor 7 and JAK-STAT signalling pathways in PBMCs of infected Egyptian females.,J Viral Hepat, 2012 Dec,23121363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23121363/,Summary. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health concern in Egypt being highly prevalent among Egyptians. The two genders experience different responses to HCV infection and show variations in response to interferon (IFN)-based therapy that may be attributed to sex hormones. We previously demonstrated the suppressive effect of 17β-estradiol (E2) on the expression of the IFN-stimulated gene MxA in HCV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The selective oestrogen receptor (ER) modulator Tamoxifen has been shown to have an antiviral effect against HCV， but its effect on the host immune response is unknown. We investigated the effect of Tamoxifen on the IFN signalling pathways in PBMCs of HCV-infected Egyptian females. We pooled PBMCs and treated then with exogenous interferon alpha (IFNα) or the TLR7 ligand， Imiquimod， and quantified the relative expressions of MxA using RTqPCR. Studies were performed with and without Tamoxifen pretreatment. Pretreatment with Tamoxifen reversed the suppressive effect of E2 on the JAK-STAT pathway in IFNα-treated PBMCs as indicated by a significant increase in MxA expression (P = 0.05*). Tamoxifen pretreatment also significantly upregulated MxA expression in Imiquimod-treated PBMCs (P = 0.0011**)， an effect not ascribed to ER blocking nor to an upregulation in TLR7 expression because Tamoxifen showed no potentiating effect on the expression of the receptor. In conclusion， our findings reveal that Tamoxifen has immunomodulatory effects whereby it enhances the host IFN signalling pathways during HCV infection.
GSK-3beta inhibitor 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime promotes both adhesive activity and drug resistance in colorectal cancer cells.,Int J Oncol, 2017 Dec,29039496,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29039496/,Multi-targets inhibitor 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime (BIO) has diverse biological effects on cancer cells. The key component of the β-catenin destruction complex glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)， one of the major target for BIO， polyubiquitination and degradation of the main oncoprotein β-catenin in colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study， we evaluated the effect of BIO on drug resistance and biological properties of CRC cells. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling revealed that differentially expressed genes were mainly centered on well-characterized signaling pathways including stem cell， cell adhesion and cell growth in BIO-treated CRC cells. BIO treatment downregulated migration and invasion abilities of CRC cells， accompanying with MMP-9 downregulated and E-cadherin upregulated CRC cells. BIO treatment decreased apoptosis induced by 5-Fu/DDP in CRC SW480 cells. In addition， BIO treatment reversed the 5-Fu-induced CD133+ cell downregulation trend in CRC SW620 cells. After incubation with BIO， the expression levels of EpCAM， TERT and DCAMKL-1 proteins were upregulated in CRC cells. BIO treatment downregulated the activity of GSK-3β， upregulated and transported β-catenin to the nucleus in CRC cells. Our findings reveal that BIO treatment upregulated stemness， adhesive and chemoresistance of CRC cells. GSK-3β inhibition and WNT/β-catenin activation by BIO， may partly result in the biological behavior alterations in CRC cells.
The investigation of synovial genomic targets of bucillamine with microarray technique.,Inflamm Res, 2009 Sep,19290479,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19290479/,Objective:To identify the molecular mechanisms of bucillamine activity， global gene expression analysis and pathway analysis were conducted using IL-1 beta-stimulated human fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLS).Methods:Normal human FLS were treated with IL-1 beta in the presence or absence of 10 and 100 microM bucillamine for 6 h. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression levels were detected using a 44 k human whole genome array. Data were analyzed using Ingenuity pathway analysis.Results:Numerous pathways were activated by IL-1 beta stimulation. At both concentrations， bucillamine suppressed nine signal pathways stimulated by IL-1 beta.Conclusions:Bucillamine effectively inhibited fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and tight junction signaling activated by IL-1 beta in FLS. Suppression of these signal pathways may correlate with the pharmacologic mechanisms of bucillamine. In particular， the suppression of FGF signaling by bucillamine is remarkable because the activation of FGF signaling may be involved in rheumatoid arthritis pathology.
Impact of Preservation Solutions on the Trichogenicity of Hair Micrografts Ascertained by Dermal Papilla Gene Expression.,Dermatol Surg, 2019 Dec,30865019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30865019/,Background:Appropriate storage of human hair follicle (HF) grafts during follicular unit excision (FUE) is crucial toward successful hair shaft implantation. Several commercial storage solutions are currently used to ensure ex vivo maintenance of follicular grafts viability and trichogenicity. However， quantitative experimental evidence demonstrating molecular changes in HF cells associated with the usage of different storage solutions is largely missing.Objective:To identify gene expression changes in HF cells caused by ex vivo storage of hair grafts in different preservation conditions.Methods:The authors performed gene expression analysis in dermal papilla (DP) isolated from HF stored under different temperatures and solutions. The expression signature of key genes controlling hair growth and cycling， apoptosis， inflammation， and senescence was assessed for (1) chilled versus room temperature (RT) and (2) DP cell medium， saline， Hypothermosol， platelet-rich plasma， and ATPv-supplemented saline.Results:The authors found chilled versus RT to prevent inflammatory cytokine signaling. Under chilled conditions， ATPv-supplemented saline was the best condition to preserve the expression of the trichogenic genes HEY1 and LEF1.Conclusion:Data disclose DP gene expression analysis as a useful methodology to ascertain the efficacy of preserving solutions and elucidate about the best currently available option for FUE clinical practice.
Bruton's tyrosine kinase regulates TLR9 but not TLR7 signaling in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells.,Eur J Immunol, 2014 Apr,24375473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24375473/,Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) represent a key cell type for both innate and adaptive immunity. PDCs express both TLR7 and TLR9 and the recognition of nucleic acids by these two receptors triggers the production of a large amount of type-I IFN and the induction of PDC maturation into APCs. This unique feature of PDCs is at the basis of clinical development of both TLR7 and TLR9 agonists for infectious diseases， allergy， cancer， and asthma. However， TLR7 and TLR9 recognition of self-nucleic acids is linked to many autoimmune diseases including lupus， and a better understanding of the signaling pathways of these two receptors in PDCs is thus important. We have identified Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) as an important player for TLR9 but not TLR7 signaling in human PDCs. Blocking Btk using a specific inhibitor leads to the reduction of all TLR9-induced responses in PDCs， including cytokine production and expression of costimulatory molecules， while this has no impact on the TLR7 response. This identifies Btk as a key molecule in TLR9 signaling in PDCs and is the first demonstration that the TLR7 and TLR9 pathways can be dissociated in human PDCs.Keywords:Autoimmunity; Bruton's tyrosine kinase; Innate immunity; Plasmacytoid dendritic cells; Toll-like receptors.
Chronic hypoxia-induced slug promotes invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells by activating expression of ephrin-B1.,Cancer Sci, 2018 Oct,30058095,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30058095/,dvanced solid tumors are exposed to hypoxic conditions over longer periods of time as they grow. Tumor hypoxia is a major factor that induces malignant progression， but most previous studies on tumor hypoxia were performed under short-term hypoxia for up to 72 hours and few studies have focused on tumor response to chronic hypoxic conditions. Here we show a molecular mechanism by which chronic hypoxia promotes invasive behavior in prostate cancer cells. We found that an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-driving transcription factor， slug， is specifically upregulated under chronic hypoxia and promotes tumor cell migration and invasion. Unexpectedly， processes associated with EMT， such as loss of E-cadherin， are not observed under chronic hypoxia. Instead， expression of ephrin-B1， a ligand of Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases， is markedly induced by slug through E-box motifs and promotes cell migration and invasion. Furthermore， slug and ephrin-B1 are highly coexpressed in chronic hypoxic cells of human prostate adenocarcinoma tissues after androgen deprivation， which is known to cause tumor hypoxia. Taken together， these results indicate that chronic hypoxia-induced slug promotes invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells by activating the expression of ephrin-B1. In addition， ephrin-B1 may be a novel therapeutic target in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for aggressive prostate cancer.Keywords:androgen deprivation; chronic hypoxia; ephrin-B1; invasion; slug.

Reversal of endocrine resistance in breast cancer: interrelationships among 14-3-3zeta， FOXM1， and a gene signature associated with mitosis.,Breast Cancer Res, 2011 Jun 29,21707964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21707964/,Introduction:Despite the benefits of estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted endocrine therapies in breast cancer， many tumors develop resistance. 14-3-3 ζ/YWHAZ， a member of the 14-3-3 family of conserved proteins， is over-expressed in several types of cancer， and our previous work showed that high expression of 14-3-3ζ in ER-positive breast cancers was associated with a poor clinical outcome for women on tamoxifen. Therefore， we now probe the role of 14-3-3ζ in endocrine resistance， and we examine the functional dimensions and molecular basis that underlie 14-3-3ζ activities.Methods:From analyses of four independent breast cancer microarray datasets from nearly 400 women， we characterized a gene signature that correlated strongly with high expression of 14-3-3ζ in breast tumors and examined its association with breast cancer molecular subtypes and clinical-pathological features. We investigated the effects of altering 14-3-3ζ levels in ER-positive， endocrine sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells on the regulation of 14-3-3ζ signature genes， and on cellular signaling pathways and cell phenotypic properties.Results:The gene signature associated with high 14-3-3ζ levels in breast tumors encompassed many with functions in mitosis and cytokinesis， including aurora kinase-B， polo-like kinase-1， CDC25B， and BIRC5/survivin. The gene signature correlated with early recurrence and risk of metastasis， and was found predominantly in luminal B breast cancers， the more aggressive ER-positive molecular subtype. The expression of the signature genes was significantly decreased or increased upon reduction or overexpression of 14-3-3ζ in ER-positive breast cancer cells， indicating their coregulation. 14-3-3ζ also played a critical role in the regulation of FOXM1， with 14-3-3ζ acting upstream of FOXM1 to regulate cell division-signature genes. Depletion of 14-3-3ζ markedly increased apoptosis， reduced proliferation and receptor tyrosine kinase (HER2 and EGFR) signaling， and， importantly， reversed endocrine resistance.Conclusions:This study reveals that 14-3-3ζ is a key predictive marker for risk of failure on endocrine therapy and serves a pivotal role impacting growth factor signaling， and promoting cell survival and resistance to endocrine therapies. Targeting 14-3-3ζ and its coregulated proteins， such as FOXM1， should prove valuable in restoring endocrine sensitivity and reducing risk of breast cancer recurrence.

Lrig1 is an estrogen-regulated growth suppressor and correlates with longer relapse-free survival in ERα-positive breast cancer.,Mol Cancer Res, 2011 Oct,21821674,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21821674/,
Cytotoxicity of Thymus vulgaris essential oil towards human oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.,Anticancer Res, 2011 Jan,21273584,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21273584/,Background:Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) accounts for 2% to 3% of all malignancies and has a high mortality rate. The majority of anticancer drugs are of natural origin. However， it is unknown whether the medicinal plant Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme) is cytotoxic towards head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Materials and methods:Cytotoxicity of thyme essential oil was investigated on the HNSCC cell line， UMSCC1. The IC₅₀ of thyme essential oil extract was 369 μg/ml. Moreover， we performed pharmacogenomics analyses.Results:Genes involved in the cell cycle， cell death and cancer were involved in the cytotoxic activity of thyme essential oil at the transcriptional level. The three most significantly regulated pathways by thyme essential oil were interferon signaling， N-glycan biosynthesis and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) signaling.Conclusion:Thyme essential oil inhibits human HNSCC cell growth. Based on pharmacogenomic approaches， novel insights into the molecular mode of anticancer activity of thyme are presented.
Interleukin-6-dependent gene expression profiles in multiple myeloma INA-6 cells reveal a Bcl-2 family-independent survival pathway closely associated with Stat3 activation.,Blood, 2004 Jan 1,12969979,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12969979/,Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a growth and survival factor for multiple myeloma cells. As we report here， the IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell line INA-6 responds with a remarkably rapid and complete apoptosis to cytokine withdrawal. Among the antiapoptotic members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family of apoptosis regulators， only myeloid cell factor-1 (Mcl-1) was slightly induced by IL-6. Overexpression studies demonstrated， however， that IL-6 does not exert its survival effect primarily through this pathway. The IL-6 signal transduction pathways required for survival and the target genes controlled by them were analyzed by using mutated receptor chimeras. The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) turned out to be obligatory for the survival of INA-6 cells. The same held true for survival and growth of XG-1 myeloma cells. Gene expression profiling of INA-6 cells by using oligonucleotide microarrays revealed many novel IL-6 target genes， among them several genes coding for transcriptional regulators involved in B-lymphocyte differentiation as well as for growth factors and receptors potentially implicated in autocrine or paracrine growth control. Regulation of most IL-6 target genes required the activation of Stat3， underscoring its central role for IL-6 signal transduction. Taken together， our data provide evidence for the existence of an as yet unknown Stat3-dependent survival pathway in myeloma cells.

Functional genomics identifies TOR-regulated genes that control growth and division.,Curr Biol, 2006 May 23,16713952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16713952/,Background:The TOR (target of rapamycin) ser/thr protein kinase is the central component of a eukaryotic signaling pathway that regulates growth and is the direct target of the clinically useful drug rapamycin. Recent efforts have identified at least two multiprotein complexes that contain TOR， but little is known in higher eukaryotes about the genes downstream of TOR that control growth.Results:By combining the use of a small molecule inhibitor (rapamycin)， transcriptional profiling， and RNA interference in Drosophila tissue culture cells， we identified genes whose expression responds to Drosophila TOR (dTOR) inhibition and that regulate cell size. Several of the dTOR-regulated genes that function in cell size control have additional roles in cell division. Most of these genes are conserved in mammals and several are linked to human disease. This set of genes is highly enriched for regulators of ribosome biogenesis， which emphasizes the importance of TOR-dependent transcription in building the protein synthesis machinery in higher eukaryotes. In addition， we identify two dTOR-regulated genes， CG3071 and CG6677， whose human orthologs， SAW and ASH2L， are also under TOR-dependent transcriptional control and encode proteins with conserved functional roles in growth.Conclusions:We conclude that combining RNA interference with genomic analysis approaches， such as transcriptional profiling， is an effective way to identify genes functioning in a particular biological process. Moreover， this strategy， if applied in model systems with simpler genomes， can identify genes with conserved functions in mammals.

Non-phosphorylated FTY720 induces apoptosis of human microglia by activating SREBP2.,Cell Mol Neurobiol, 2011 Oct,21519925,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21519925/, synthetic analog of sphingosine named FTY720 (Fingolimod)， phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase-2， interacts with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors expressed on various cells. FTY720 suppresses the disease activity of multiple sclerosis (MS) chiefly by inhibiting S1P-dependent egress of autoreactive T lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs， and possibly by exerting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects directly on brain cells. However， at present， biological effects of FTY720 on human microglia are largely unknown. We studied FTY720-mediated apoptosis of a human microglia cell line HMO6. The exposure of HMO6 cells to non-phosphorylated FTY720 (FTY720-non-P) induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 10.6 ± 2.0 μM， accompanied by the cleavage of caspase-7 and caspase-3 but not of caspase-9. The apoptosis was inhibited by Z-DQMD-FMK， a caspase-3 inhibitor， but not by Pertussis toxin， a Gi protein inhibitor， suramin， a S1P3/S1P5 inhibitor， or W123， a S1P1 competitive antagonist， although HMO6 expressed S1P1， S1P2， and S1P3. Furthermore， both phosphorylated FTY720 (FTY720-P) and SEW2871， S1P1 selective agonists， did not induce apoptosis of HMO6. Genome-wide gene expression profiling and molecular network analysis indicated activation of transcriptional regulation by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) in FTY720-non-P-treated HMO6 cells. Western blot verified activation of SREBP2 in these cells， and apoptosis was enhanced by pretreatment with simvastatin， an activator of SREBP2， and by overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of SREBP2. These observations suggest that FTY720-non-P-induced apoptosis of HMO6 human microglia is independent of S1P receptor binding， and positively regulated by the SREBP2-dependent proapoptotic signaling pathway.

Role of the pro-survival molecule Bfl-1 in melanoma.,Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 2015 Feb,25486183,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25486183/,Bfl-1 is a pro-survival Bcl-2 family member overexpressed in a subset of chemoresistant tumours， including melanoma. Here， we characterised the expression and regulation of Bfl-1 in normal and malignant melanocytes and determined its role in protecting these cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Bfl-1 was mitochondrially resident in both resting and apoptotic cells and experienced regulation by the proteasome and NFκB pathways. siRNA-mediated knockdown enhanced sensitivity towards various relevant drug treatments， with forced overexpression of Bfl-1 protective. These findings identify Bfl-1 as a contributor towards therapeutic resistance in melanoma cells and support the use of NFκB inhibitors alongside current treatment strategies.Keywords:Apoptosis; BCL2A1; Bfl-1; Melanocytes; Melanoma.

Resveratrol alters microRNA expression profiles in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells.,Mol Cells, 2011 Sep,21887509,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21887509/,Resveratrol is a plant phenolic phytoalexin that has been reported to have antitumor properties in several types of cancers. In particular， several studies have suggested that resveratrol exerts antiproliferative effects against A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells; however， its mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs)， a class of small， noncoding， regulatory RNA molecules involved in gene expression， is strongly correlated with lung cancer. In this study， we demonstrated that resveratrol treatment altered miRNA expression in A549 cells. Using microarray analysis， we identified 71 miRNAs exhibiting greater than 2-fold expression changes in resveratrol-treated cells relative to their expression levels in untreated cells. Furthermore， we identified target genes related to apoptosis， cell cycle regulation， cell proliferation， and differentiation using a miRNA target-prediction program. In conclusion， our data demonstrate that resveratrol induces considerable changes in the miRNA expression profiles of A549 cells， suggesting a novel approach for studying the anticancer mechanisms of resveratrol.
Long non-coding RNAs as targets for immunosuppressive drug teriflunomide in anti-cancer potential for hepatocellular carcinoma.,J Mol Histol, 2020 Dec,33034797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33034797/,Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer. Because of the relatively chemotherapy-refractory nature of HCC and significant potential poor hepatic reserve， chemotherapy has not been used consistently in the treatment of HCC. Effective new drugs for HCC are urgently needed. Teriflunomide， which was approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS)， has been identified as a potential antineoplastic drug. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of RNA molecules defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein coding potential. In this study， we investigated the ability of teriflunomide to act as an antineoplastic drug by examining the effects of teriflunomide treatment on HCC cells. Teriflunomide strongly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells， induced cell apoptosis and induced cell accumulation in S phases of the cell cycle. LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of HCC cells treated with teriflunomide compared with controls were performed by using microarray analysis. For comparison， the differentially expressed mRNAs were annotated by using gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. The microarray revealed that 2085 lncRNAs and 1561 mRNAs differed in the cells treated with teriflunomide compared with controls. Several GO terms including protein folding， mitochondrial outer membrane， transmembrane receptor protein phosphatase activity， negative regulation of cellular biosynthetic process， DNA packaging complex， and receptor signaling protein activity were enriched in gene lists， suggesting a potential correlation with the action mechanism of teriflunomide. Pathway analysis then demonstrated that JAK-STAT signaling pathway may play important roles in the cell apoptosis induced by teriflunomide. Co-expression network analysis indicated that a number of lncRNAs and mRNAs were included in the co-expression network， and p34710_v4 is the lncRNA with highest degree. Then the mRNAs associated with those differentially expressed lncRNAs were also annotated by using gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. The pathway analyses shows that teriflunomide significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis partly by participating in Wnt signaling pathways. These findings suggest that teriflunomide could be a potential drug for chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies of HCC.Keywords:Hepatocellular carcinoma; Long non-coding RNAs; Microarray; Teriflunomide.
Regulation of Extracellular Matrix Synthesis by Shell Extracts from the Marine Bivalve Pecten maximus in Human Articular Chondrocytes- Application for Cartilage Engineering.,Mar Biotechnol (NY), 2018 Aug,29627869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29627869/,The shells of the bivalve mollusks are organo-mineral structures predominantly composed of calcium carbonate， but also of a minor organic matrix， a mixture of proteins， glycoproteins， and polysaccharides. These proteins are involved in mineral deposition and， more generally， in the spatial organization of the shell crystallites in well-defined microstructures. In this work， we extracted different organic shell extracts (acid-soluble matrix， acid-insoluble matrix， water-soluble matrix， guanidine HCl/EDTA-extracted matrix， referred as ASM， AIM， WSM， and EDTAM， respectively) from the shell of the scallop Pecten maximus and studied their biological activities on human articular chondrocytes (HACs). We found that these extracts differentially modulate the biological activities of HACs， depending on the type of extraction and the concentration used. Furthermore， we showed that， unlike ASM and AIM， WSM promotes maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype in monolayer culture. WSM increased the expression of chondrocyte-specific markers (aggrecan and type II collagen)， without enhancing that of the main chondrocyte dedifferentiation marker (type I collagen). We also demonstrated that WSM could favor redifferentiation of chondrocyte in collagen sponge scaffold in hypoxia. Thus， this study suggests that the organic matrix of Pecten maximus， particularly WSM， may contain interesting molecules with chondrogenic effects. Our research emphasizes the potential use of WSM of Pecten maximus for cell therapy of cartilage.Keywords:Cartilage engineering; Human articular chondrocytes; Pecten maximus; Shell extracts; Water-soluble matrix.
MCPIP1 overexpression in human neuroblastoma cell lines causes cell-cycle arrest by G1/S checkpoint block.,J Cell Biochem, 2020 Jun,31919874,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919874/,Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) has a multidomain structure， which assures its pleiotropic activity. The physiological functions of this protein include repression of inflammatory processes and the prevention of immune disorders. The influence of MCPIP1 on the cell cycle of cancer cells has not been sufficiently elucidated. A previous study by our group reported that overexpression of MCPIP1 affects the cell viability， inhibits the activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signalling pathway， and reduces the stability of the MYCN oncogene in neuroblastoma (NB) cells. Furthermore， a decrease in expression and phosphorylation levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1， which has a key role in the M phase of the cell cycle， was observed. On the basis of these previous results， the purpose of our present study was to elucidate the influence of MCPIP1 on the cell cycle of NB cells. It was confirmed that ectopic overexpression of MCPIP1 in two human NB cell lines， KELLY and BE(2)-C， inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore， flow cytometric analyses and imaging of the cell cycle with a fluorescence ubiquitination cell-cycle indicator test， demonstrated that overexpression of MCPIP1 causes an accumulation of NB cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle， while the possibility of an increase in G0 phase due to induction of quiescence or senescence was excluded. Additional assessment of the molecular machinery responsible for the transition between the cell-cycle phases confirmed that MCPIP1 overexpression reduced the expression of cyclins A2， B1， D1， D3， E1， and E2 and decreased the phosphorylation of CDK2 and CDK4， as well as retinoblastoma protein. In conclusion， the present results indicated a relevant impact of overexpression of MCPIP1 on the cell cycle， namely a block of the G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint， resulting in arrest of NB cells in the G1 phase.Keywords:G1/S cell-cycle arrest; MCPIP1; cell cycle; neuroblastoma.
Comparison of growth inhibition profiles and mechanisms of apoptosis induction in human colon cancer cell lines by isothiocyanates and indoles from Brassicaceae.,Mutat Res, 2006 Jul 25,16500682,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16500682/,The isothiocyanates sulforaphane and PEITC (beta-phenethyl isothiocyanate) as well as the indoles indole-3-carbinol and its condensation product 3，3'-diindolylmethane are known to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. In this study， we compared the cell growth inhibitory potential of the four compounds on the p53 wild type human colon cancer cell line 40-16 (p53(+/+)) and its p53 knockout derivative 379.2 (p53(-/-)) (both derived from HCT116). Using sulforhodamin B staining to assess cell proliferation， we found that the isothiocyanates were strongly cytotoxic， whereas the indoles inhibited cell growth in a cytostatic manner. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of all four compounds in both cell lines ranged from 5-15 microM after 24， 48 and 72 h of treatment. Apoptosis induction was analyzed by immunoblotting of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Treatment with sulforaphane (15 microM)， PEITC (10 microM)， indole-3-carbinol (10 microM) and 3，3'-diindolylmethane (10 microM) induced PARP cleavage after 24 and 48 h in both 40-16 and the 379.2 cell lines， suggestive of a p53-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction. In cultured 40-16 cells， activation of caspase-9 and -7 detected by Western blotting indicated involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. We detected time- and concentration-dependent changes in protein expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) as well as pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak proteins. Of note is that for sulforaphane only， ratios of pro- to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein levels directly correlated with apoptosis induction measured by PARP cleavage. Taken together， we demonstrated that the glucosinolate breakdown products investigated in this study have distinct profiles of cell growth inhibition， potential to induce p53-independent apoptosis and to modulate Bcl-2 family protein expression in human colon cancer cell lines.
Mechanical stress is required for high-level expression of connective tissue growth factor.,Exp Cell Res, 2002 Mar 10,11855859,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11855859/,We used gene array technology to analyze differences in gene expression between mechanically stressed and relaxed fibroblasts. A number of stress-responsive genes that showed a two- to sixfold difference in their relative expression were identified. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was among those genes that showed the most striking up-regulation by mechanical stress. Its regulation occurred at the transcriptional level and was reversible. A new steady state level of CTGF mRNA was reached within less than 6 h after stress relaxation. Mechanical stress was absolutely required for sustained high-level expression; TGF-beta， which is also known to stimulate CTGF synthesis， was not sufficient on its own. Experiments with specific inhibitors suggested that a protein kinase and a tyrosine phosphatase were involved in the transduction of the mechanical stimulus to gene expression. Since CTGF controls the synthesis of several extracellular matrix proteins， it is likely that this growth factor is responsible for the increased synthesis of collagen I and other matrix proteins in stressed fibroblasts.
Crocin induces ROS-mediated papillary thyroid cancer cell apoptosis by modulating the miR-34a-5p/PTPN4 axis in vitro.,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 2022 Feb 15,35085590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35085590/,miR-34a-5p has been reported to be upregulated and function as an oncogene in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Crocin， the major chemical constituent of saffron， has been demonstrated to possess anti-tumorigenic activity and decrease miR-34a-5p expression. Thus we hypothesized that crocin exerted anti-PCT effect by downregulating miR-34a-5p. Herein， the hypothetical mechanism underlying the anti-PCT effect of crocin was explored. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by CCK-8 and TUNEL assays， respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level， caspase-3 activity， and LDH release were measured using corresponding commercially available assay kits. Expression of miR-34a-5p and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 4 (PTPN4) was analyzed using qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. Interaction between miR-34a-5p and targets were predicted by Targetscan， starbase， miRDB， microT-CDS， and miRWalk and validated using luciferase reporter assay. Results showed that crocin inhibited the viability and miR-34a-5p expression in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells in a dose-dependent manner. The Venn diagram showed that 10 overlapped targets of miR-34a-5p were identified， among which PTPN4 was the most significantly downregulated target gene in thyroid cancer tissues based on the heat map and bar plot from GSE33630 analysis. Luciferase reporter assay validated the direct interaction between miR-34a-5p and PTPN4. Crocin upregulated PTPN4 by decreasing miR-34a-5p expression in PTC cells. Crocin promoted apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activity and LDH release， which were reversed by ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)， miR-34a overexpression， and PTPN4 silencing. To conclude， crocin promoted ROS-mediated apoptosis of PTC cells by modulating the miR-34a-5p/PTPN4 axis.Keywords:Apoptosis; Crocin; PTPN4; Reactive oxygen species; miR-34a-5p.
Characterization of arsenic trioxide resistant clones derived from Jurkat leukemia T cell line: focus on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.,Chem Biol Interact, 2013 Oct 5,23911876,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911876/,In this study the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in arsenic trioxide (ATO)-treated parental Jurkat cells and also in derived ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of given ATO concentration was investigated. ATO-resistant clones (cultured for 8-12weeks in the presence of 1， 2.5 and 5μM ATO) were characterized by high viability in the presence of ATO but slower growth rate compared to the parental cells. Morphological and functional characterization of derived ATO-resistant clones revealed that they did not differ fundamentally from parental Jurkat cells in terms of cell size， level of GSH， the lysosomal fluorescence or CD95/Fas surface antigen expression. However， a slight increase in the mitochondrial potential (JC-1 staining) was detected in the clones compared to parental Jurkat cells. Side population analysis (Vybrant DyeCycle Violet™ staining) in ATO resistant clones did not indicate any enrichment withcancer stem cells. Akt1/2， AktV or wortmannin inhibitors decreased viability of ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of ATO， with no effect on ATO-treated parental cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that ATO decreased the level of p-Akt in ATO-treated parental cells， while the resistant clones exhibited higher levels of p-Akt immunostaining than parental Jurkat cells. Expression analysis of 84 genes involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway revealed that this pathway was predominantly active in ATO-resistant clones. c-JUN seems to play a key role in the induction of cell death in ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells， as dose-dependent strong up-regulation of JUN was specific for the ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells. On the other hand， changes in expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1)， insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase C isoforms (PRKCZ，PRKCB and PRKCA) may be responsible for the induction of resistance to ATO. The changes in expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) observed in ATO-resistant clones suggest a possibility of induction of different mechanisms in development of resistance to ATO depending on the drug concentration and thus involvement of different signaling mediators.Keywords:Akt kinase; Arsenic resistant clones; Arsenic trioxide; Jurkat; Leukemia.
Induction of acute phase response genes in keratinocytes following exposure to oligodeoxynucleotides.,J Mol Med (Berl), 2002 Jun,12072913,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12072913/,Keratinocytes have the ability to take up oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and plasmid DNA probably by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Despite the use of DNA for antisense and gene therapy little is known about the regulation of genes following exposure to nucleic acids. To systematically identify gene regulation in keratinocytes upon exposure to ODN we screened human cytokine DNA arrays containing 383 different genes and found interleukin (IL) 1alpha， IL-1beta， integrin-beta(1)， alpha-tubulin， and follistatin highly induced， while most genes were unaffected. The time course and concentration dependence for IL-1alpha and follistatin expression were analyzed by standard northern blot technique. ODN of different length and sequence induced comparable amounts of IL-1alpha and follistatin. Their induction was independent of negative charge and of several proinflammatory compounds such as lipopolysaccharides， IL-1beta， and interferon-gamma but was partly inhibited by activin A. In summary， our study revealed several genes of the acute phase protein family that are induced in a non-sequence-specific manner following the exposure of normal human keratinocytes to ODN. Therefore it is tempting to speculate that upon internalization ODN bind to an intracellular receptor (e.g.， Toll-like receptor 9) which mediates signaling.
CYP1A1 is overexpressed upon incubation of breast cancer cells with a polyphenolic cocoa extract.,Eur J Nutr, 2012 Jun,21822728,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21822728/,Purpose:To evaluate the effect of cocoa flavonoids in breast cancer cells at the molecular level， a functional genomic analysis was performed using a polyphenolic cocoa extract (PCE) in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cell lines.Methods:The expression profile of 84 genes included in the Stress & Toxicity PathwayFinder™ PCR Array was analyzed after PCE incubation for 24 h. mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot， respectively. Gel shift assays were used to evaluate DNA-protein complexes. Protein complexes were identified by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assays.Results:Upon PCE incubation， 7 genes were overexpressed and 1 underexpressed in MCF-7 cells， whereas 9 genes were overexpressed in SKBR3 cells. Among the differentially expressed genes in both cell lines， cytochrome P450， family 1， subfamily A， polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) was chosen for further study. CYP1A1 mRNA and protein levels and enzymatic activity increased upon PCE incubation. CYP1A1 transcriptional activation by PCE was mediated through AhR binding to XRE elements within the CYP1A1 promoter in MCF-7 cells. A protein complex including AhR and ERα was detected. The combination of PCE with tamoxifen caused a synergistic cytotoxicity in both cell lines and was due to an increase in apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.Conclusions:The interaction between ERα and AhR upon incubation with PCE leads to CYP1A1 induction in breast cancer cells. The synergy between PCE and non-cytotoxic tamoxifen concentrations opens the possibility for a combination therapy based on polyphenols from cocoa that increased tamoxifen efficacy.
Induction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator， interleukin-8 and early growth response-1 by STI571 through activating mitogen activated protein kinase in human small cell lung cancer cells.,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis, 2007 Jul,17581316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17581316/,We previously demonstrated the simultaneous induction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and interleukin-8， a CXC chemokine， in doxorubicin-treated human NCI-H69 small cell lung cancer cells in which extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase might be involved. NCI-H69 cells expressed one of the receptor tyrosine kinases， c-Kit， and STI571 inhibited the cell growth and stem cell factor-induced phosphorylation of c-Kit. We therefore investigated the effects of STI571 on the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and interleukin-8 in NCI-H69 cells. Microarray analysis revealed the gene induction of not only urokinase-type plasminogen activator and interleukin-8， but also early growth response-1 in STI571-treated cells. Treatment with STI571 resulted in the induction of phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinases， such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2， p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun N-terminal protein kinase. U0126， an inhibitor against extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2， however， only inhibited the STI571-induced interleukin-8 accumulation. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator and interleukin-8 are important biological factors in tumor cell regulation; STI571 may therefore influence many aspects of tumor cell biology through inducing urokinase-type plasminogen activator and interleukin-8， in which the induction of early growth response-1 expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation might be involved.
The unique spliceosome signature of human pluripotent stem cells is mediated by SNRPA1， SNRPD1， and PNN.,Stem Cell Res, 2017 Jul,28595116,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28595116/,Spliceosomes are the core host of pre-mRNA splicing， allowing multiple protein isoforms to be produced from a single gene. Herein， we reveal that spliceosomes are more abundant in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSs)， including human embryonic stem cells (hESs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSs)， than non-hPSs， and their presence is associated with high transcriptional activity. Supportively， spliceosomal components involved in the catalytically active pre-mRNA splicing step were mainly co-localized with hPS spliceosomes. By profiling the gene expression of 342 selected splicing factors， we found that 71 genes were significantly altered during the reprogramming of human somatic cells into hiPSs. Among them， SNRPA1， SNRPD1， and PNN were significantly up-regulated during the early stage of reprogramming， identified as hub genes by interaction network and cluster analysis. SNRPA1， SNRPD1， or PNN depletion led to a pronounced loss of pluripotency and significantly blocked hiPS generation. SNRPA1， SNRPD1， and PNN co-localized with the hPS spliceosomes， physically interacted with each other， and positively influenced the appearance of hPS spliceosomes. Our data suggest that SNRPA1， SNRPD1， and PNN are key players in the regulation of pluripotency-specific spliceosome assembly and the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency.Keywords:PNN; Pluripotent stem cells; SF3b1; SNRPA1; SNRPD1; Spliceosome.
miR-200 expression regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in bladder cancer cells and reverses resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor therapy.,Clin Cancer Res, 2009 Aug 15,19671845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19671845/,Purpose:The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cell development-regulated process in which noncoding RNAs act as crucial modulators. Recent studies have implied that EMT may contribute to resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy. The aims of this study were to determine the potential role of microRNAs (miRNA) in controlling EMT and the role of EMT in inducing the sensitivity of human bladder cancer cells to the inhibitory effects of the anti-EGFR therapy.Experimental design:miRNA array screening and real-time reverse transcription-PCR were used to identify and validate the differential expression of miRNAs involved in EMT in nine bladder cancer cell lines. A list of potential miR-200 direct targets was identified through the TargetScan database. The precursor of miR-200b and miR-200c was expressed in UMUC3 and T24 cells using a retrovirus or a lentivirus construct， respectively. Protein expression and signaling pathway modulation， as well as intracellular distribution of EGFR and ERRFI-1， were validated through Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy， whereas ERRFI-1 direct target of miR-200 members was validated by using the wild-type and mutant 3'-untranslated region/ERRFI-1/luciferse reporters.Results:We identified a tight association between the expression of miRNAs of the miR-200 family， epithelial phenotype， and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors-induced growth inhibition in bladder carcinoma cell lines. Stable expression of miR-200 in mesenchymal UMUC3 cells increased E-cadherin levels， decreased expression of ZEB1， ZEB2， ERRFI-1， and cell migration， and increased sensitivity to EGFR-blocking agents. The changes in EGFR sensitivity by silencing or forced expression of ERRFI-1 or by miR-200 expression have also been validated in additional cell lines， UMUC5 and T24. Finally， luciferase assays using 3'-untranslated region/ERRFI-1/luciferase and miR-200 cotransfections showed that the direct down-regulation of ERRFI-1 was miR-200-dependent because mutations in the two putative miR-200-binding sites have rescued the inhibitory effect.Conclusions:Members of the miR-200 family appear to control the EMT process and sensitivity to EGFR therapy in bladder cancer cells and the expression of miR-200 is sufficient to restore EGFR dependency at least in some of the mesenchymal bladder cancer cells. The targets of miR-200 include ERRFI-1， which is a novel regulator of EGFR-independent growth.
Bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhances the osteogenic differentiation capacity of mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human bone marrow and umbilical cord.,Int J Mol Med, 2017 Mar,28204808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28204808/,Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can give rise to different cell types of the mesodermal lineages. They are powerful sources for cell therapy in regenerative medicine as they can be isolated from various tissues， and can be expanded and induced to differentiate into multiple lineages. Recently， the umbilical cord has been suggested as an alternative source of MSCs. Although MSCs derived from the umbilical cord can be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts with a phenotypic similarity to that of bone marrow-derived MSCs， the differentiation ability is not consistent. In addition， MSCs from the umbilical cord require a longer period of time to differentiate into osteoblasts. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in bone tissue regeneration. In addition， several studies have supported the use of BMP-2 in periodontal regeneration， sinus lift bone-grafting and non-unions in oral surgery. Although the use of BMP-2 for bone tissue regeneration has been extensively investigated， the BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs derived from the umbilical cord has not yet been fully examined. Therefore， in this study， we aimed to examine the effects of BMP-2 on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs derived from umbilical cord compared to that of MSCs derived from bone marrow. The degree of osteogenic differentiation following BMP-2 treatment was determined by assessing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity， and the expression profiles of osteogenic differentiation marker genes， osterix (Osx)， Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (Ocn). The results revealed that BMP-2 enhanced the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs derived from both bone marrow and umbilical cord as demonstrated by increased ALP activity and the upregulation of osteogenic differentiation marker genes. The enhancement of the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs by BMP-2 suggests that these MSCs may be used as alternative sources for bone engineering or cell therapy in regenerative medicine.
Compounds from the marine sponge Cribrochalina vasculum offer a way to target IGF-1R mediated signaling in tumor cells.,Oncotarget, 2016 Aug 2,27384680,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27384680/,In this work two acetylene alcohols， compound 1 and compound 2， which were isolated and identified from the sponge Cribrochalina vasculum， and which showed anti-tumor effects were further studied with respect to targets and action mechanisms. Gene expression analyses suggested insulin like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) signaling to be instrumental in controlling anti-tumor efficacy of these compounds in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indeed compounds 1 and 2 inhibited phosphorylation of IGF-1Rβ as well as reduced its target signaling molecules IRS-1 and PDK1 allowing inhibition of pro-survival signaling. In silico docking indicated that compound 1 binds to the kinase domain of IGF-1R at the same binding site as the well known tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024. Indeed， cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) confirmed that C. vasculum compound 1 binds to IGF-1R but not to the membrane localized tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR. Importantly， we demonstrate that compound 1 causes IGF-1Rβ but not Insulin Receptor degradation specifically in tumor cells with no effects seen in normal diploid fibroblasts. Thus， these compounds hold potential as novel therapeutic agents targeting IGF-1R signaling for anti-tumor treatment.Keywords:insulin growth factor receptor; lung cancer; natural products; small molecule; sponge.
Identification of an IL-22-Dependent Gene Signature as a Pharmacodynamic Biomarker.,Int J Mol Sci, 2021 Jul 30,34360971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360971/,Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a role in epithelial barrier function and repair， and may provide benefits in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. However， limited human data are available to assess the clinical effect of IL-22 administration. This study used a human intestinal cell line to identify an IL-22-dependent gene signature that could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for IL-22 therapy. The response to IL-22Fc (UTTR1147A， an Fc-stabilized version of IL-22) was assessed in HT-29 cells by microarray， and the selected responsive genes were confirmed by qPCR. HT-29 cells demonstrated dose-dependent increases in STAT3 phosphorylation and multiple gene expression changes in response to UTTR1147A. Genes were selected that were upregulated by UTTR1147A， but to a lesser extent by IL-6， which also signals via STAT3. IL-1R1 was highly upregulated by UTTR1147A， and differential gene expression patterns were observed in response to IL-22Fc in the presence of IL-1β. An IL-22-dependent gene signature was identified that could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in intestinal biopsies to support the clinical development of an IL-22 therapeutic. The differential gene expression pattern in the presence of IL-1β suggests that an inflammatory cytokine milieu in the disease setting could influence the clinical responses to IL-22.Keywords:IBD; IL-1β; IL-22; antimicrobial; epithelial repair; gene expression; pharmacodynamic biomarker.
Electrical stimulation promotes maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells.,J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2013 Dec,24081385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24081385/,While human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes， their immature phenotypes limit their therapeutic application for myocardial regeneration. We sought to determine whether electrical stimulation could enhance the differentiation and maturation of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Cardiac differentiation was induced in a HES3 hESC line via embryoid bodies formation treated with a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor. Detailed molecular and functional analysis were performed in those hESC-derived cardiomyocytes cultured for 4 days in the absence or presence of electrical field stimulation (6.6 V/cm， 1 Hz， and 2 ms pulses) using an eight-channel C-Pace stimulator (Ion-Optics Co.， MA). Upon electrical stimulation， quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated significant upregulation of cardiac-specific gene expression including HCN1， MLC2V， SCN5A， SERCA， Kv4.3， and GATA4; immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis revealed cellular elongation and an increased proportion of troponin-T positive cells (6.3 ± 1.2% vs. 15.8 ± 2.1%; n = 3， P < 0.01). Electrophysiological studies showed an increase in the proportion of ventricular-like hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (48 vs. 29%， P < 0.05) with lengthening of their action potential duration at 90% repolarization (387.7 ± 35.35; n = 11 vs. 291.8 ± 20.82; n = 10， P < 0.05) and 50% repolarization (313.9 ± 27.94; n = 11 vs. 234.0 ± 16.10; n = 10， P < 0.05) after electrical stimulation. Nonetheless， the membrane diastolic potentials and action potential upstrokes of different hESC-derived cardiomyocyte phenotypes， and the overall beating rate remained unchanged (all P > 0.05). Fluorescence confocal imaging revealed that electrical stimulation significantly increased both spontaneous and caffeine-induced calcium flux in the hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (approximately 1.6-fold for both cases; P < 0.01). In conclusion， electrical field stimulation increased the expression of cardiac-specific genes and the yield of differentiation， promoted ventricular-like phenotypes， and improved the calcium handling of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes.
The expression of 70 apoptosis genes in relation to lineage， genetic subtype， cellular drug resistance， and outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood, 2006 Jan 15,16189266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16189266/,Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) consists of various subtypes that respond differently to cytotoxic drugs and therefore have a markedly different clinical outcome. We used microarrays to investigate， in 190 children with ALL at initial diagnosis， whether 70 key apoptosis genes were differentially expressed between leukemic subgroups defined by lineage， genetic subtype， in vitro drug resistance， and clinical outcome. The expression of 44 of 70 genes was significantly different in T-versus B-lineage ALL， 22 genes differed in hyperdiploid versus nonhyperdiploid， 16 in TEL-AML1-positive versus-negative， and 13 in E2A-rearranged versus germ-line B-lineage ALL. Expression of MCL1 and DAPK1 was significantly associated with prednisolone sensitivity， whereas BCL2L13， HRK， and TNF were related to L-asparaginase resistance. BCL2L13 overexpression was also associated with unfavorable clinical outcome (P < .001). Multivariate analysis including known risk factors revealed that BCL2L13 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P = .011). The same trend was observed in a validation group of 92 children with ALL treated on a different protocol at St Jude (P = .051). In conclusion， ALL subtypes have a unique expression pattern of apoptosis genes and our data suggest that selective genes are linked to cellular drug resistance and prognosis in childhood B-lineage ALL.

H-Ras regulation of TRAIL death receptor mediated apoptosis.,Oncotarget, 2014 Jul 15,25026275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25026275/,TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through the death receptors (DRs) 4 and/or 5 expressed on the cell surface. Multiple clinical trials are underway to evaluate the antitumor activity of recombinant human TRAIL and agonistic antibodies to DR4 or DR5. However， their therapeutic potential is limited by the high frequency of cancer resistance. Here we provide evidence demonstrating the role of H-Ras in TRAIL receptor mediated apoptosis. By analyzing the genome wide mRNA expression data of the NCI60 cancer cell lines， we found that H-Ras expression was consistently upregulated in TRAIL-resistant cell lines. By contrast， no correlation was found between TRAIL sensitivity and K-Ras expression levels or their mutational profiles. Notably， H-Ras upregulation associated with a surface deficiency of TRAIL death receptors. Selective inhibition of H-Ras activity in TRAIL-resistant cells restored the surface expression of both DR4 and DR5 without changing their total protein levels. The resulting cells became highly susceptible to both TRAIL and agonistic DR5 antibody， whereas K-Ras inhibition had little or no effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis， indicating H-Ras plays a distinct role in the regulation of TRAIL death receptors. Further studies are warranted to determine the therapeutic potential of H-Ras-specific inhibitors in combination with TRAIL receptor agonists.
Distinct carbon sources affect structural and functional maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells.,Sci Rep, 2017 Aug 17,28819274,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28819274/,"The immature phenotype of human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) constrains their potential in cell therapy and drug testing. In this study， we report that shifting hPSC-CMs from glucose-containing to galactose- and fatty acid-containing medium promotes their fast maturation into adult-like CMs with higher oxidative metabolism， transcriptional signatures closer to those of adult ventricular tissue， higher myofibril density and alignment， improved calcium handling， enhanced contractility， and more physiological action potential kinetics. Integrated ""-Omics"" analyses showed that addition of galactose to culture medium improves total oxidative capacity of the cells and ameliorates fatty acid oxidation avoiding the lipotoxicity that results from cell exposure to high fatty acid levels. This study provides an important link between substrate utilization and functional maturation of hPSC-CMs facilitating the application of this promising cell type in clinical and preclinical applications."

AdeABC-mediated efflux and tigecycline MICs for epidemic clones of Acinetobacter baumannii.,J Antimicrob Chemother, 2010 Aug,20554571,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20554571/,Objectives:Tigecycline non-susceptibility in individual Acinetobacter baumannii isolates has been associated with up-regulation of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type efflux system， AdeABC. We sought to relate variation in the expression of this system to differences in modal tigecycline MIC among prevalent A. baumannii clones. The role of AdeABC in the emergence of tigecycline resistance during therapy was also investigated for two representatives of the prevalent UK lineage， OXA-23 clone 1.Methods:Clonal type was defined by PFGE and expression of adeABC by real-time RT-PCR. Laboratory mutants were selected in vitro by exposing a susceptible clinical isolate to increasing tigecycline concentrations. The adeB gene was inactivated by the directed integration of a suicide plasmid containing an internal fragment of the target gene.Results:Higher modal tigecycline MICs for particular clones correlated with elevated expression of adeABC. Expression of this operon was also increased in the two post-therapy， tigecycline-resistant clinical isolates and in a laboratory mutant as compared with their pre-exposure， tigecycline-susceptible counterparts. Interruption of adeB in a tigecycline-resistant clinical isolate restored full susceptibility to tigecycline.Conclusions:Differences in expression of adeABC contribute to both inter- and intra-clone variation in tigecycline MICs. Tigecycline resistance can arise during therapy， mediated by up-regulation of AdeABC.

Modulation of ErbB2 blockade in ErbB2-positive cancers: the role of ErbB2 Mutations and PHLDA1.,PLoS One, 2014 Sep 19,25238247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25238247/,We set out to study the key effectors of resistance and sensitivity to ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors， such as lapatinib in ErbB2-positive breast and lung cancers. A cell-based in vitro site-directed mutagenesis lapatinib resistance model identified several mutations， including the gatekeeper ErbB2 mutation ErbB2-T798I， as mediating resistance. ErbB2-T798I engineered cell models indeed show resistance to lapatinib but remain sensitive to the irreversible EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor， PD168393， suggestive of potential alternative treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Gene expression profiling studies identified a select group of downstream targets regulated by ErbB2 signaling and define PHLDA1 as an immediately downregulated gene upon oncogenic ErbB2 signaling inhibition. We find significant down-regulation of PHLDA1 in primary breast cancer and PHLDA1 is statistically significantly less expressed in ErbB2 negative compared with ErbB2 positive tumors consistent with its regulation by ErbB2. Lastly， PHLDA1 overexpression blocks AKT signaling， inhibits cell growth and enhances lapatinib sensitivity further supporting an important negative growth regulator function. Our findings suggest that PHLDA1 might have key inhibitory functions in ErbB2 driven lung and breast cancer cells and a better understanding of its functions might point at novel therapeutic options. In summary， our studies define novel ways of modulating sensitivity and resistance to ErbB2 inhibition in ErbB2-dependent cancers.
Distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of the stress induced protein DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153.,PLoS One, 2012,22496745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22496745/,DDIT3， also known as GADD153 or CHOP， encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor of the dimer forming C/EBP family. DDIT3 is known as a key regulator of cellular stress response， but its target genes and functions are not well characterized. Here， we applied a genome wide microarray based expression analysis to identify DDIT3 target genes and functions. By analyzing cells carrying tamoxifen inducible DDIT3 expression constructs we show distinct gene expression profiles for cells with cytoplasmic and nuclear localized DDIT3. Of 175 target genes identified only 3 were regulated by DDIT3 in both cellular localizations. More than two thirds of the genes were downregulated， supporting a role for DDIT3 as a dominant negative factor that could act by either cytoplasmic or nuclear sequestration of dimer forming transcription factor partners. Functional annotation of target genes showed cell migration， proliferation and apoptosis/survival as the most affected categories. Cytoplasmic DDIT3 affected more migration associated genes， while nuclear DDIT3 regulated more cell cycle controlling genes. Cell culture experiments confirmed that cytoplasmic DDIT3 inhibited migration， while nuclear DDIT3 caused a G1 cell cycle arrest. Promoters of target genes showed no common sequence motifs， reflecting that DDIT3 forms heterodimers with several alternative transcription factors that bind to different motifs. We conclude that expression of cytoplasmic DDIT3 regulated 94 genes. Nuclear translocation of DDIT3 regulated 81 additional genes linked to functions already affected by cytoplasmic DDIT3. Characterization of DDIT3 regulated functions helps understanding its role in stress response and involvement in cancer and degenerative disorders.
LYN is a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and a target of dasatinib in breast cancer.,Cancer Res, 2010 Mar 15,20215510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20215510/,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)， a switch of polarized epithelial cells to a migratory， fibroblastoid phenotype， is considered a key process driving tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis. Using breast cancer cell lines as a model system， we sought to discover gene expression signatures of EMT with clinical and mechanistic relevance. A supervised comparison of epithelial and mesenchymal breast cancer lines defined a 200-gene EMT signature that was prognostic across multiple breast cancer cohorts. The immunostaining of LYN， a top-ranked EMT signature gene and Src-family tyrosine kinase， was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (P = 0.02) and correlated with the basal-like (""triple-negative"") phenotype. In mesenchymal breast cancer lines， RNAi-mediated knockdown of LYN inhibited cell migration and invasion， but not proliferation. Dasatinib， a dual-specificity tyrosine kinase inhibitor， also blocked invasion (but not proliferation) at nanomolar concentrations that inhibit LYN kinase activity， suggesting that LYN is a likely target and that invasion is a relevant end point for dasatinib therapy. Our findings define a prognostically relevant EMT signature in breast cancer and identify LYN as a mediator of invasion and a possible new therapeutic target (and theranostic marker for dasatinib response)， with particular relevance to clinically aggressive basal-like breast cancer."

Rhododendrol， a depigmentation-inducing phenolic compound， exerts melanocyte cytotoxicity via a tyrosinase-dependent mechanism.,Pigment Cell Melanoma Res, 2014 Sep,24890809,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24890809/,Rhododendrol， an inhibitor of melanin synthesis developed for lightening/whitening cosmetics， was recently reported to induce a depigmentary disorder principally at the sites of repeated chemical contact. Rhododendrol competitively inhibited mushroom tyrosinase and served as a good substrate， while it also showed cytotoxicity against cultured human melanocytes at high concentrations sufficient for inhibiting tyrosinase. The cytotoxicity was abolished by phenylthiourea， a chelator of the copper ions at the active site， and by specific knockdown of tyrosinase with siRNA. Hence， the cytotoxicity appeared to be triggered by the enzymatic conversion of rhododendrol to active product(s). No reactive oxygen species were detected in the treated melanocytes， but up-regulation of the CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein gene responsible for apoptosis and/or autophagy and caspase-3 activation were found to be tyrosinase dependent. These results suggest that a tyrosinase-dependent accumulation of ER stress and/or activation of the apoptotic pathway may contribute to the melanocyte cytotoxicity.Keywords:ER stress; chemical leukoderma; cytotoxicity; depigmentation; rhododendrol; tyrosinase; vitiligo.

MIR-451 and Imatinib mesylate inhibit tumor growth of Glioblastoma stem cells.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2008 Nov 7,18765229,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18765229/,We examined the microRNA profiles of Glioblastoma stem (CD133+) and non-stem (CD133-) cell populations and found up-regulation of several miRs in the CD133- cells， including miR-451， miR-486， and miR-425， some of which may be involved in regulation of brain differentiation. Transfection of GBM cells with the above miRs inhibited neurosphere formation and transfection with the mature miR-451 dispersed neurospheres， and inhibited GBM cell growth. Furthermore， transfection of miR-451 combined with Imatinib mesylate treatment had a cooperative effect in dispersal of GBM neurospheres. In addition， we identified a target site for SMAD in the promoter region of miR-451 and showed that SMAD3 and 4 activate such a promoter-luciferase construct. Transfection of SMAD in GBM cells inhibited their growth， suggesting that SMAD may drive GBM stem cells to differentiate to CD133- cells through up-regulation of miR-451 and reduces their tumorigenicity. Identification of additional miRs and target genes that regulate GBM stem cells may provide new potential drugs for therapy.
BRAF inhibition upregulates a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream effector Gab2 in colorectal cancer cell lines.,Oncogene, 2018 Mar,29326440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29326440/,"BRAF mutations occur in ~10% of colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with poor prognosis. Inhibitors selective for the BRAFV600Eoncoprotein， the most common BRAF mutant， elicit only poor response rates in BRAF-mutant CRC as single agents. This unresponsiveness was mechanistically attributed to the loss of negative feedbacks on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiated clinical trials that combine BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors， either singly or in combination， with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. First results of these combinatorial studies demonstrated improved efficacy， however， the response rates still were heterogeneous. Here， we show that BRAF inhibition leads to the upregulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in CRC cell lines， including not only the EGFR， but also human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER3. Importantly， combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032)， dabrafenib， or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib， canertinib， and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells. This re-sensitization was also observed after genetic depletion of HER2 or HER3. Interestingly， BRAF inhibitors did not only upregulate RTKs， but also increased the abundance of the GRB2-associated binders (Gab) 1 and Gab2， two important amplifiers of RTK signaling. An allele-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAFV600Erevealed that Gab2 upregulation was directly dependent on the loss of the oncoprotein and was not caused by an ""off-target"" effect of these kinase inhibitors. Furthermore， Gab2 and Gab2-mediated Shp2 signaling were shown to be functionally important in BRAFi resistance. These findings highlight potential new escape mechanisms to these targeted therapies and indicate that a broad suppression of RTK signaling might be beneficial and should be taken into account in future research addressing targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant CRC."

Expression of hepaCAM is downregulated in cancers and induces senescence-like growth arrest via a p53/p21-dependent pathway in human breast cancer cells.,Carcinogenesis, 2008 Dec,18845560,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18845560/,Previously， we reported the identification of a novel immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule hepaCAM that is frequently downregulated and inhibits cell growth in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study， we show that the expression of hepaCAM is suppressed in diverse human cancers. Aiming to evaluate the biological role of hepaCAM in breast cancer， we stably transfected the MCF7 cell line with either wild-type hepaCAM or its mutant hCAM-tailless that lacked the cytoplasmic domain. We found that hepaCAM inhibited colony formation and cell proliferation and arrested cells in the G(2)/M phase. Intriguingly， hepaCAM was capable of inducing cellular senescence as defined by the enlarged cell morphology and increased beta-galactosidase activity. Furthermore， hepaCAM elevated the expression levels of senescence-associated proteins including p53， p21 and p27. In contrast， cell growth inhibition and senescence were less apparent in cells overexpressing hCAM-tailless mutant. To determine if the p53-mediated pathway was involved in hepaCAM-induced senescence， we used the small-interfering RNA system to knock down endogenous p53 expression. In the presence of hepaCAM， downregulation of p53 resulted in a clear reduction of p21， insignificant change in p27 and alleviated senescence. Together， the results suggest that the expression of hepaCAM in MCF7 cells not only inhibits cell growth but also induces cellular senescence through the p53/21 pathway.

Benzo[a]pyrene promotes proliferation of human lung cancer cells by accelerating the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway.,Cancer Lett, 2009 Jun 8,19181443,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19181443/,Smoking is an independent prognostic factor of lung adenocarcinoma. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is one of the strongest carcinogens and it is present in both the environment and cigarette smoke. In this study， the effect of B[a]P on the proliferative activity of lung adenocarcinoma cells was investigated. A lung adenocarcinoma cell line， A549， was cultured with B[a]P for various periods， and its proliferative activity was examined by an MTS assay. To investigate the intracellular events related to the proliferative activity， the gene expression profile was investigated by a microarray analysis and a quantitative RT-PCR， and the protein expression and activation status of Akt， ERK 1/2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were examined by a western blot analysis. Following the culture with B[a]P for 24 weeks， the serum-independent proliferative activity was increased. A microarray analysis revealed that a reversible upregulation of the EGFR and epiregulin genes was recognized in the B[a]P treated cells， in which the overexpression of the phosphorylated EGFR protein was also recognized. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor reduced the cellular proliferation and the level of phosphorylation of ERK1/2， which is a downstream signal of the EGFR， in the B[a]P-treated A549 cells. Moreover， the B[a]P treatment increased the mRNA expressions of the ligands for EGFR such as amphiregulin and epiregulin. B[a]P increases the proliferative potential of lung adenocarcinoma cells through the EGFR signaling pathway.
LAMA3 DNA methylation and transcriptome changes associated with chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer.,J Ovarian Res, 2021 May 15,33992120,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33992120/,
Phenotypic and transcriptional profile correlates with functional plasticity of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.,Immunol Cell Biol, 2014 Feb,24296812,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24296812/,The role of CD4(+) T cells in the control of infectious pathogens is highly complex with a myriad of functions but how these T cells acquire differential functional potentiality remains poorly defined. Here we show that human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD4(+) T cells directed towards different viral antigens expressed predominantly TNF-α alone or TNF-α and IFN-γ. TNF-α(+) and IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells expressed significantly higher levels of T-box transcription factors T-bet with graded loss of Eomesodermin (Eomes) expression (T-bet(Hi)Eomes(Hi/Lo)) when compared with TNF-α(+) CD4(+) T cells expressing lower levels of both T-bet and Eomes (T-bet(-)Eomes(-)). Furthermore， TNF-α(+) and IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells expressed significantly higher levels of perforin and interleukin (IL)-2 and displayed a terminally differentiated phenotype (CCR7(-)CD27(-)CD45RA(-)CD57(+)CD62L(-)). In contrast， TNF-α(+) alone CMV-specific CD4(+) T cells were predominantly early-memory phenotype with a proportion of these cells displaying T memory stem-cell phenotype (CD95(+)CD45RA(+)CCR7(+)CD27(+)). In vitro stimulation of CMV-specific CD4(+) T cells with viral antigen in the presence of IL-12 was sufficient to dramatically change the transcriptional and functional profile of TNF-α(+) CD4(+) T cells， whereas TNF-α(+) and IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells remained unaltered. These findings illustrate an intrinsic link between cytokine expression， transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation， and their impact on functional plasticity of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells.
Sensitivity of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to targeted inhibition of BET epigenetic signaling proteins.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2012 Nov 20,23129625,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23129625/,Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins function as epigenetic signaling factors that associate with acetylated histones and facilitate transcription of target genes. Inhibitors targeting the activity of BET proteins have shown potent antiproliferative effects in hematological cancers through the suppression of c-MYC and downstream target genes. However， as the epigenetic landscape of a cell varies drastically depending on lineage， transcriptional coactivators such as BETs would be expected to have different targets in cancers derived from different cells of origin， and this may influence the activity and mechanism of action of BET inhibitors. To test this hypothesis， we treated a panel of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) cell lines with the BET inhibitor JQ1 and found that a subset is acutely susceptible to BET inhibition. In contrast to blood tumors， we show that LAC cells are inhibited by JQ1 through a mechanism independent of c-MYC down-regulation. Through gene expression profiling， we discovered that the oncogenic transcription factor FOSL1 and its targets are suppressed by JQ1 in a dose-dependant manner. Knockdown of BRD4 also decreased FOSL1 levels， and inhibition of FOSL1 phenocopied the effects of JQ1 treatment， suggesting that loss of this transcription factor may be partly responsible for the cytotoxic effects of BET inhibition in LAC cells， although ectopic expression of FOSL1 alone did not rescue the phenotype. Together， these findings suggest that BET inhibitors may be useful in solid tumors and that cell-lineage-specific differences in transcriptional targets of BETs may influence the activity of inhibitors of these proteins in different cancer types.
Role of Epac and protein kinase A in thyrotropin-induced gene expression in primary thyrocytes.,Exp Cell Res, 2012 Mar 10,22240166,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22240166/,MP pathway activation by thyrotropin (TSH) induces differentiation and gene expression in thyrocytes. We investigated which partners of the cAMP cascade regulate gene expression modulations: protein kinase A and/or the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Human primary cultured thyrocytes were analysed by microarrays after treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin， the protein kinase A (PKA) activator 6-MB-cAMP and the Epac-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP (007) alone or combined with 6-MB-cAMP. Profiles were compared to those of TSH. Cultures treated with the adenylate cyclase- or the PKA activator alone or the latter combined with 007 had profiles similar to those induced by TSH. mRNA profiles of 007-treated cultures were highly distinct from TSH-treated cells， suggesting that TSH-modulated gene expressions are mainly modulated by cAMP and PKA and not through Epac in cultured human thyroid cells. To investigate whether the Epac-Rap-RapGAP pathway could play a potential role in thyroid tumorigenesis， the mRNA expressions of its constituent proteins were investigated in two malignant thyroid tumor types. Modulations of this pathway suggest an increased Rap pathway activity in these cancers independent from cAMP activation.
Effects of thymoquinone in the expression of mucin 4 in pancreatic cancer cells: implications for the development of novel cancer therapies.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2010 May,20423995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20423995/,Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in the world， as it continues to be resistant to any therapeutic approaches. The high molecular weight glycoprotein mucin 4 (MUC4) is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer and contributes to the regulation of differentiation， proliferation， metastasis， and the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells. The absence of its expression in the normal pancreatic ductal cells makes MUC4 a promising target for novel cancer therapeutics. Natural products have been widely investigated as potential candidates in cancer therapies， and thymoquinone (TQ)， extracted from the seeds of Nigella sativa， has shown excellent antineoplastic properties in some systems. In the present study， we evaluated the effect of TQ on pancreatic cancer cells and specifically investigated its effect on MUC4 expression. The MUC4-expressing pancreatic cancer cells FG/COLO357 and CD18/HPAF were incubated with TQ， and in vitro functional assays were done. The results obtained indicate that treatment with TQ downregulated MUC4 expression through the proteasomal pathway and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by the activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In agreement with previous studies， the decrease in MUC4 expression correlated with an increase in apoptosis， decreased motility， and decreased migration of pancreatic cancer cells. MUC4 transient silencing studies showed that c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are activated in pancreatic cancer cells， indicating that the activation of these pathways by TQ is directly related to the MUC4 downregulation induced by the drug. Overall， TQ has potential for the development of novel therapies against pancreatic cancer.
IgG4 drives M2a macrophages to a regulatory M2b-like phenotype: potential implication in immune tolerance.,Allergy, 2019 Mar,30338531,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338531/,Background:Macrophages can be converted in vitro into immunoregulatory M2b macrophages in the presence of immune complexes (ICs)， but the role of the specific subclasses IgG1 or IgG4 in this phenotypic and functional change is not known.Objective:We aimed to refine the original method by applying precisely defined ICs of the subclasses IgG4 or IgG1 constructed by two independent methods.Methods:Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were treated with M-CSF， followed by IL-4/IL-13 to induce the M2a allergic phenotype. To mimic unspecific or allergen-specific ICs， plates were coated with myeloma IgG1 or IgG4， or with grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 followed by recombinant human Phl p 5-specific IgG1 or IgG4. M2a polarized macrophages were then added， cultured， and examined for cellular markers and cytokines by flow cytometry， ELISA， and rtPCR. Alternatively， immune complexes with IgG1 or IgG4 were formed using protein L.Results:IgG4 ICs down regulated CD163 and CD206 on M2a cells， and significantly increased IL-10， IL-6， TNFα， and CCL1 secretion， indicating a shift to an M2b-like phenotype. Treatment with IgG4 ICs resulted in expression of FcγRII and down modulation of FcγRII compared with IgG1 treated cells (P = 0.0335) or untreated cells (P < 0.00001).Conclusion:Immune complexes with subclasses IgG1 and IgG4 can in vitro be generated by plate absorption， and in fluid form by protein L. Cross-linking of FcγRIIb by the IgG4 subclass redirects pro-allergic M2a macrophages to an M2b-like immunosuppressive phenotype. This suggests an interplay of macrophages with IgG4 in immune tolerance， likely relevant in allergen immunotherapy.Keywords:CCL1; IgG4; M2b macrophages; allergy; immune tolerance.
Molecular basis for decreased folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase expression in a methotrexate resistant CCRF-CEM mutant cell line.,Leuk Res, 2007 Mar,16884772,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16884772/, CCRF-CEM mutant， CEM-p， has been shown to exhibit resistance to methotrexate due to decreased methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation. To ascertain the mechanism(s) responsible for this phenotype， we analyzed FPGS and SLC19A1 mRNA expression， examined FPGS promoter activity， and determined nucleotide sequence of the FPGS promoter and full length cDNA from CCRF-CEM and CEM-p cells. We identified in FPGS from CEM-p cells three amino acid substitutions that altered the ATP binding P-loop， glutamate/folate binding， and a conserved domain located at the carboxyl-terminal. Our data demonstrated for the first time the importance of the highly conserved domain (VTGSLHLVGGV) located at the carboxyl-terminal for FPGS activity.
In vitro epigenetic reprogramming of human cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells into functionally competent cardiovascular precursors.,PLoS One, 2012,23284745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23284745/,dult human cardiac mesenchymal-like stromal cells (CStC) represent a relatively accessible cell type useful for therapy. In this light， their conversion into cardiovascular precursors represents a potential successful strategy for cardiac repair. The aim of the present work was to reprogram CStC into functionally competent cardiovascular precursors using epigenetically active small molecules. CStC were exposed to low serum (5% FBS) in the presence of 5 µM all-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)， 5 µM Phenyl Butyrate (PB)， and 200 µM diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide (DETA/NO)， to create a novel epigenetically active cocktail (EpiC). Upon treatment the expression of markers typical of cardiac resident stem cells such as c-Kit and MDR-1 were up-regulated， together with the expression of a number of cardiovascular-associated genes including KDR， GATA6， Nkx2.5， GATA4， HCN4， NaV1.5， and α-MHC. In addition， profiling analysis revealed that a significant number of microRNA involved in cardiomyocyte biology and cell differentiation/proliferation， including miR 133a， 210 and 34a， were up-regulated. Remarkably， almost 45% of EpiC-treated cells exhibited a TTX-sensitive sodium current and， to a lower extent in a few cells， also the pacemaker I(f) current. Mechanistically， the exposure to EpiC treatment introduced global histone modifications， characterized by increased levels of H3K4Me3 and H4K16Ac， as well as reduced H4K20Me3 and H3s10P， a pattern compatible with reduced proliferation and chromatin relaxation. Consistently， ChIP experiments performed with H3K4me3 or H3s10P histone modifications revealed the presence of a specific EpiC-dependent pattern in c-Kit， MDR-1， and Nkx2.5 promoter regions， possibly contributing to their modified expression. Taken together， these data indicate that CStC may be epigenetically reprogrammed to acquire molecular and biological properties associated with competent cardiovascular precursors.
Comprehensive methylome analysis of ovarian tumors reveals hedgehog signaling pathway regulators as prognostic DNA methylation biomarkers.,Epigenetics, 2013 Jun,23774800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774800/,"Women with advanced stage ovarian cancer (OC) have a five-year survival rate of less than 25%. OC progression is associated with accumulation of epigenetic alterations and aberrant DNA methylation in gene promoters acts as an inactivating ""hit"" during OC initiation and progression. Abnormal DNA methylation in OC has been used to predict disease outcome and therapy response. To globally examine DNA methylation in OC， we used next-generation sequencing technology， MethylCap-sequencing， to screen 75 malignant and 26 normal or benign ovarian tissues. Differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) were identified， and the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used to correlate methylation with clinical endpoints. Functional role of specific genes identified by MethylCap-sequencing was examined in in vitro assays. We identified 577 DMRs that distinguished (p < 0.001) malignant from non-malignant ovarian tissues; of these， 63 DMRs correlated (p < 0.001) with poor progression free survival (PFS). Concordant hypermethylation and corresponding gene silencing of sonic hedgehog pathway members ZIC1 and ZIC4 in OC tumors was confirmed in a panel of OC cell lines， and ZIC1 and ZIC4 repression correlated with increased proliferation， migration and invasion. ZIC1 promoter hypermethylation correlated (p < 0.01) with poor PFS. In summary， we identified functional DNA methylation biomarkers significantly associated with clinical outcome in OC and suggest our comprehensive methylome analysis has significant translational potential for guiding the design of future clinical investigations targeting the OC epigenome. Methylation of ZIC1， a putative tumor suppressor， may be a novel determinant of OC outcome.Keywords:DNA methylation; Hedgehog pathway; ZIC1; ZIC4; ovarian cancer."
Identification of a panel of ten cell surface protein antigens associated with immunotargeting of leukemias and lymphomas by peripheral blood gammadelta T cells.,Haematologica, 2010 Aug,20220060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20220060/,"Background:Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes are regarded as promising mediators of cancer immunotherapy due to their capacity to eliminate multiple experimental tumors， particularly within those of hematopoietic origin. However， Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell based lymphoma clinical trials have suffered from the lack of biomarkers that can be used as prognostic of therapeutic success.Design and methods:We have conducted a comprehensive study of gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas， aimed at identifying markers of susceptibility versus resistance to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We employed cDNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR to screen 20 leukemia and lymphoma cell lines， and 23 primary hematopoietic tumor samples. These data were analyzed using state-of-the-art bioinformatics， and gene expression patterns were correlated with susceptibility to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell mediated cytolysis in vitro.Results:We identified a panel of 10 genes encoding cell surface proteins that were statistically differentially expressed between ""gammadelta-susceptible"" and ""gammadelta-resistant"" hematopoietic tumors. Within this panel， 3 genes (ULBP1， TFR2 and IFITM1) were associated with increased susceptibility to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T-cell cytotoxicity， whereas the other 7 (CLEC2D， NRP2， SELL， PKD2， KCNK12， ITGA6 and SLAMF1) were enriched in resistant tumors. Furthermore， some of these candidates displayed a striking variance of expression among primary follicular lymphomas and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias.Conclusions:Our results suggest that hematopoietic tumors display a highly variable repertoire of surface proteins that can impact on Vgamma9Vdelta2 cell-mediated immunotargeting. The prognostic value of the proposed markers can now be evaluated in upcoming Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-based lymphoma/leukemia clinical trials."
Curcumin enhances non-opsonic phagocytosis of Plasmodium falciparum through up-regulation of CD36 surface expression on monocytes/macrophages.,J Antimicrob Chemother, 2012 Aug,22511637,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22511637/,Objectives:Curcumin is a natural plant product with antimalarial activity and immunomodulatory properties. In this study we aimed to investigate its effects on CD36 expression and CD36-mediated Plasmodium falciparum phagocytosis as well as the role played by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ retinoid X receptor (PPARγ-RXR) in these processes.Methods:In vitro antimalarial activity was evaluated by the [³H]hypoxanthine assay. ROS production and surface CD36 in human monocyte/macrophages were measured by flow cytometry. PPARγ and CD36 mRNA expression was determined by the QuantiGene Plex® assay and RT-qPCR. Nuclear PPARγ activation was analysed by a DNA-binding ELISA while nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression was analysed by western blotting. P. falciparum phagocytosis was assessed by light microscopy.Results:Curcumin's antimalarial activity was confirmed and did not differ between drug-susceptible and -resistant P. falciparum strains. Curcumin increased monocyte ROS production and expression of PPARγ and CD36 at the mRNA and protein levels. Although PPARγ activation was blocked by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662， CD36 expression and CD36-mediated P. falciparum phagocytosis were only inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC)， suggesting a PPARγ-independent CD36 expression pathway. We then identified seven putative Nrf2 antioxidant response elements on the CD36 gene promoter and showed that NAC inhibited curcumin-induced Nrf2 protein expression.Conclusions:CD36 expression and CD36-mediated P. falciparum phagocytosis by curcumin are dependent on ROS production and probably involve the Nrf2 pathway. The dual immunomodulatory and antimalarial mechanisms of curcumin action may mean that curcumin has potential as an adjuvant treatment limiting the risk of recrudescence following standard antimalarial therapy.
Gene expression signatures associated with the in vitro resistance to two tyrosine kinase inhibitors， nilotinib and imatinib.,Blood Cancer J, 2011 Aug,22829191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22829191/,The use of selective inhibitors targeting Bcr-Abl kinase is now established as a standard protocol in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia; however， the acquisition of drug resistance is a major obstacle limiting the treatment efficacy. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of drug resistance， we established K562 cell line models resistant to nilotinib and imatinib. Microarray-based transcriptome profiling of resistant cells revealed that nilotinib- and imatinib-resistant cells showed the upregulation of kinase-encoding genes (AURKC， FYN， SYK， BTK and YES1). Among them， the upregulation of AURKC and FYN was observed both in nilotinib- and imatinib-resistant cells irrespective of exposure doses， while SYK， BTK and YES1 showed dose-dependent upregulation of expression. Upregulation of EGF and JAG1 oncogenes as well as genes encoding ATP-dependent drug efflux pump proteins such as ABCB1 was also observed in the resistant cells， which may confer alternative survival benefits. Functional gene set analysis revealed that molecular categories of 'ATPase activity'， 'cell adhesion' or 'tyrosine kinase activity' were commonly activated in the resistant clones. Taken together， the transcriptome analysis of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)-resistant clones provides the insights into the mechanism of drug resistance， which can facilitate the development of an effective screening method as well as therapeutic intervention to deal with TKI resistance.

Human hair follicles are an extrarenal source and a nonhematopoietic target of erythropoietin.,FASEB J, 2007 Oct,17540710,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17540710/,Erythropoietin primarily serves as an essential growth factor for erythrocyte precursor cells. However， there is increasing evidence that erythropoietin (EPO)/EPO receptor (EPO-R) signaling operates as a potential tissue-protective system outside the bone marrow. Arguing that growing hair follicles (HF) are among the most rapidly proliferating tissues， we have here explored whether human HFs are sources of EPO and targets of EPO-R-mediated signaling. Human scalp skin and microdissected HFs were assessed for EPO and EPO-R expression， and the effects of EPO on organ-cultured HFs were assessed in the presence/absence of a classical apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agent. Here， we show that human scalp HFs express EPO on the mRNA and protein level in situ， up-regulate EPO transcription under hypoxic conditions， and express transcripts for EPO-R and the EPO-stimulatory transcriptional cofactor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. Although EPO does not significantly alter human hair growth in vitro， it significantly down-regulates chemotherapy-induced intrafollicular apoptosis and changes the gene expression program of the HFs. The current study points to intriguing targets of EPO beyond the erythropoietic system: human HFs are an extrarenal site of EPO production and an extrahematopoietic site of EPO-R expression. They may recruit EPO/EPO-R signaling e.g.， for modulating HF apoptosis under conditions of hypoxia and chemotherapy-induced stress.
Gene transfer with inducible nitric oxide synthase decreases production of urea by arginase in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells.,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, 2006 Feb,16155089,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16155089/,Nitric oxide (NO) is a vasodilator produced from L-arginine (L-Arg) by NO synthase (NOS). Gene therapy for hypertensive disorders has been proposed using the inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS). L-Arg also can be metabolized to urea and L-ornithine (L-Orn) by arginase， and L-Orn can be metabolized to proline and/or polyamines， which are vital for cellular proliferation. To determine the effect of iNOS gene transfer on arginase， we transfected bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (bPAEC) with an adenoviral vector containing the gene for iNOS (AdiNOS). As expected， NO production in AdiNOS bPAEC was substantially greater than in control bPAEC. Although urea production was significantly less in the AdiNOS bPAEC than in the control bPAEC， despite similar levels of arginase I protein， AdiNOS transfection of bPAEC had no effect on the uptake of L-Arg. Inhibiting NO production with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased urea production， and inhibiting urea production with L-valine increased nitrite production， in AdiNOS bPAEC. The addition of L-Arg to the medium increased urea production by AdiNOS bPAEC in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus， in these iNOS-transfected bPAEC， the transfected iNOS and native arginase compete for a common intracellular pool of L-Arg. This competition for substrate resulted in impaired proliferation in the AdiNOS-transfected bPAEC. These findings suggest that the use of iNOS gene therapy for pulmonary hypertensive disorders may not only be beneficial through NO-mediated pulmonary vasodilation but also may decrease vascular remodeling by limiting L-Orn production by native arginase.
GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (CD131) expression as a biomarker of antigen-stimulated CD8+ T cells.,J Transl Med, 2008 Apr 15,18412971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18412971/,Background:Upon Ag-activation cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) produce IFN-gamma GM-CSF and TNF-alpha， which deliver simultaneously pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signals to the surrounding microenvironment. Whether this secretion affects in an autocrine loop the CTLs themselves is unknown.Methods:Here， we compared the transcriptional profile of Ag-activated， Flu-specific CTL stimulated with the FLU M1:58-66 peptide to that of convivial CTLs expanded in vitro in the same culture. PBMCs from 6 HLA-A*0201 expressing donors were expanded for 7 days in culture following Flu M1:58-66 stimulation in the presence of 300 IU/ml of interleukin-2 and than sorted by high speed sorting to high purity CD8+ expressing T cells gated according to FluM1:58-66 tetrameric human leukocyte antigen complexes expression.Results:Ag-activated CTLs displayed higher levels of IFN-gamma， GM-CSF (CSF2) and GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta- chain (CD131) but lacked completely expression of IFN-gamma receptor-II and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). This observation suggested that Ag-activated CTLs in preparation for the release of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF shield themselves from the potentially apoptotic effects of the former entrusting their survival to GM-SCF. In vitro phenotyping confirmed the selective surface expression of CD131 by Ag-activated CTLs and their increased proliferation upon exogenous administration of GM-CSF.Conclusion:The selective responsiveness of Ag-activated CTLs to GM-CSF may provide an alternative explanation to the usefulness of this chemokine as an adjuvant for T cell aimed vaccines. Moreover， the selective expression of CD131 by Ag-activated CTLs proposes CD131 as a novel biomarker of Ag-dependent CTL activation.
PIK3CA mutations associated with gene signature of low mTORC1 signaling and better outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2010 Jun 1,20479250,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20479250/,PIK3CA mutations are reported to be present in approximately 25% of breast cancer (BC)， particularly the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) subtypes， making them one of the most common genetic aberrations in BC. In experimental models， these mutations have been shown to activate AKT and induce oncogenic transformation， and hence these lesions have been hypothesized to render tumors highly sensitive to therapeutic PI3K/mTOR inhibition. By analyzing gene expression and protein data from nearly 1，800 human BCs， we report that a PIK3CA mutation-associated gene signature (PIK3CA-GS) derived from exon 20 (kinase domain) mutations was able to predict PIK3CA mutation status in two independent datasets， strongly suggesting a characteristic set of gene expression-induced changes. However， in ER+/HER2- BC despite pathway activation， PIK3CA mutations were associated with a phenotype of relatively low mTORC1 signaling and a good prognosis with tamoxifen monotherapy. The relationship between clinical outcome and the PIK3CA-GS was also assessed. Although the PIK3CA-GS was not associated with prognosis in ER- and HER2+ BC， it could identify better clinical outcomes in ER+/HER2- disease. In ER+ BC cell lines， PIK3CA mutations were also associated with sensitivity to tamoxifen. These findings could have important implications for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant BCs and the development of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
DZNep is a global histone methylation inhibitor that reactivates developmental genes not silenced by DNA methylation.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2009 Jun,19509260,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19509260/,"DNA methylation， histone modifications， and nucleosomal occupancy collaborate to cause silencing of tumor-related genes in cancer. The development of drugs that target these processes is therefore important for cancer therapy. Inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hematologic malignancies. However， drugs that target other mechanisms still need to be developed. Recently， 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) was reported to selectively inhibit trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) and lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me3) as well as reactivate silenced genes in cancer cells. This finding opens the door to the pharmacologic inhibition of histone methylation. We therefore wanted to further study the mechanism of action of DZNep in cancer cells. Western blot analysis shows that DZNep globally inhibits histone methylation and is not selective. Two other drugs， sinefungin and adenosine dialdehyde， have similar effects as DZNep on H3K27me3. Intriguingly， chromatin immunoprecipitation of various histone modifications and microarray analysis show that DZNep acts through a different pathway than 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine， a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. These observations give us interesting insight into how chromatin structure affects gene expression. We also determined the kinetics of gene activation to understand if the induced changes were somatically heritable. We found that upon removal of DZNep， gene expression is reduced to its original state. This suggests that there is a homeostatic mechanism that returns the histone modifications to their ""ground state"" after DZNep treatment. Our data show the strong need for further development of histone methylation inhibitors."
Comparison of cell-surface TFPIalpha and beta.,J Thromb Haemost, 2005 Dec,16246254,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16246254/,Background:Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is mainly produced by endothelial cells and alternative mRNA splicing generates two forms， TFPIalpha and TFPIbeta. A portion of expressed TFPI remains associated with the cell surface through both direct (TFPIbeta) and indirect (TFPIalpha) glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPT)-mediated anchorage.Objective:Compare the structure and properties of TFPIalpha and TFPIbeta.Methods:TFPIalpha and TFPIbeta， with protein molecular masses of 36 and 28 kDa， respectively， migrate similarly (46 kDa) on SDS-PAGE. Experiments using specific glycosidases were carried out to determine the different glycosylation pattern of the two forms. ECV304 cells， a cell line with some endothelial properties， were stimulated with IL-lbeta， LPS， and TNFalpha for up to 24 hrs and mRNA levels and protein synthesis were determined. Stable clones of ECV304 cells that express reduced levels of TFPIalpha， TFPIbeta or both were produced using a plasmid-based small-interfering RNA technique. Surface TFPI activity was determined by a two-stage chromogenic assay based on the ability of each form to inhibit FXa activation by FVIIa on cells with comparable amount of tissue factor (TF).Results and conclusions:The deglycosylation studies show that the difference in molecular masses is due to a greater degree of sialylation in O-linked carbohydrate in TFPIbeta. The mRNA and protein levels of neither form of TFPI were affected by stimulation of cells with inflammatory stimuli. Although TFPIalpha comprises 80% of the surface-TFPI， TFPIbeta was responsible for the bulk of the cellular FVIIa/TF inhibitory activity， suggesting a potential alternative role for cell surface TFPIalpha.
Elevated AKR1C3 expression promotes prostate cancer cell survival and prostate cell-mediated endothelial cell tube formation: implications for prostate cancer progression.,BMC Cancer, 2010 Dec 6,21134280,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21134280/,Background:Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C family member 3 (AKR1C3)， one of four identified human AKR1C enzymes， catalyzes steroid， prostaglandin， and xenobiotic metabolism. In the prostate， AKR1C3 is up-regulated in localized and advanced prostate adenocarcinoma， and is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness. Here we propose a novel pathological function of AKR1C3 in tumor angiogenesis and its potential role in promoting PCa progression.Methods:To recapitulate elevated AKR1C3 expression in cancerous prostate， the human PCa PC-3 cell line was stably transfected with an AKR1C3 expression construct to establish PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants. Microarray and bioinformatics analysis were performed to identify AKR1C3-mediated pathways of activation and their potential biological consequences in PC-3 cells. Western blot analysis， reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)， and an in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assays were applied to validate the pro-angiogenic activity of PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants identified by bioinformatics analysis.Results:Microarray and bioinformatics analysis suggested that overexpression of AKR1C3 in PC-3 cells modulates estrogen and androgen metabolism， activates insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and Akt signaling pathways， as well as promotes tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. Levels of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and Akt activation as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and secretion were significantly elevated in PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants in comparison to PC3-mock transfectants. PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants also promoted endothelial cell (EC) tube formation on Matrigel as compared to the AKR1C3-negative parental PC-3 cells and PC3-mock transfectants. Pre-treatment of PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants with a selective IGF-1R kinase inhibitor (AG1024) or a non-selective phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) abolished ability of the cells to promote EC tube formation.Conclusions:Bioinformatics analysis followed by functional genomics demonstrated that AKR1C3 overexpression promotes angiogenesis and aggressiveness of PC-3 cells. These results also suggest that AKR1C3-mediated tumor angiogenesis is regulated by estrogen and androgen metabolism with subsequent IGF-1R and Akt activation followed by VEGF expression in PCa cells.
Deregulated LAP2alpha expression in cervical cancer associates with aberrant E2F and p53 activities.,IUBMB Life, 2011 Nov,21990273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21990273/,

Differential effects of dexamethasone on the chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stromal cells: influence of microenvironment， tissue origin and growth factor.,Eur Cell Mater, 2011 Nov 24,22116649,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22116649/,Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)， which reside within various tissues， are utilized in the engineering of cartilage tissue. Dexamethasone (DEX)--a synthetic glucocorticoid--is almost invariably applied to potentiate the growth-factor-induced chondrogenesis of MSCs in vitro， albeit that this effect has been experimentally demonstrated only for transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-β)-stimulated bone-marrow-derived MSCs. Clinically， systemic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with untoward side effects (e.g.， bone loss and increased susceptibility to infection). Hence， the use of these agents should be avoided or limited. We hypothesize that the influence of DEX on the chondrogenesis of MSCs depends upon their tissue origin and microenvironment [absence or presence of an extracellular matrix (ECM)]， as well as upon the nature of the growth factor. We investigated its effects upon the TGF-β1- and bone-morphogenetic-protein 2 (BMP-2)-induced chondrogenesis of MSCs as a function of tissue source (bone marrow vs. synovium) and microenvironment [cell aggregates (no ECM) vs. explants (presence of a natural ECM)]. In aggregates of bone-marrow-derived MSCs， DEX enhanced TGF-β1-induced chondrogenesis by an up-regulation of cartilaginous genes， but had little influence on the BMP-2-induced response. In aggregates of synovial MSCs， DEX exerted no remarkable effect on either TGF-β1- or BMP-2-induced chondrogenesis. In synovial explants， DEX inhibited BMP-2-induced chondrogenesis almost completely， but had little impact on the TGF-β1-induced response. Our data reveal that steroids are not indispensable for the chondrogenesis of MSCs in vitro. Their influence is context dependent (tissue source of the MSCs， their microenvironment and the nature of the growth-factor). This finding has important implications for MSC based approaches to cartilage repair.
High hypoxia status in pancreatic cancer is associated with multiple hallmarks of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.,Front Immunol, 2024 Mar 6,38510243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38510243/,
Gene profiling reveals unknown enhancing and suppressive actions of glucocorticoids on immune cells.,FASEB J, 2002 Jan,11772937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11772937/,Glucocorticoids continue to be the major immunomodulatory agents used in clinical medicine today. However， their actions as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are both beneficial and deleterious. We analyzed the effect of glucocorticoids on the gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. DNA microarray analysis combined with quantitative TaqMan PCR and flow cytometry revealed that glucocorticoids induced the expression of chemokine， cytokine， and complement family members as well as of newly discovered innate immune-related genes， including scavenger and Toll-like receptors. In contrast， glucocorticoids repressed the expression of adaptive immune-related genes. Simultaneous inhibitory and stimulatory effects of glucocorticoids were found on inflammatory T helper subsets and apoptosis-related gene clusters. In cells activated by T cell receptor cross-linking， glucocorticoids down-regulated the expression of specific genes that were previously up-regulated in resting cells， suggesting a potential new mechanism by which they exert positive and negative effects. Considering the broad and continuously renewed interest in glucocorticoid therapy， the profiles we describe here will be useful in designing more specific and efficient treatment strategies.
The Mechanism by Which MYCN Amplification Confers an Enhanced Sensitivity to a PCNA-Derived Cell Permeable Peptide in Neuroblastoma Cells.,EBioMedicine, 2015 Nov 10,26844271,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844271/,Dysregulated expression of MYC family genes is a hallmark of many malignancies. Unfortunately， these proteins are not amenable to blockade by small molecules or protein-based therapeutic agents. Therefore， we must find alternative approaches to target MYC-driven cancers. Amplification of MYCN， a MYC family member， predicts high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) disease. We have shown that R9-caPep blocks the interaction of PCNA with its binding partners and selectively kills human NB cells， especially those with MYCN amplification， and we now show the mechanism. We found elevated levels of DNA replication stress in MYCN-amplified NB cells. R9-caPep exacerbated DNA replication stress in MYCN-amplified NB cells and NB cells with an augmented level of MYC by interfering with DNA replication fork extension， leading to Chk1 dependence and susceptibility to Chk1 inhibition. We describe how these effects may be exploited for treating NB.Keywords:Chk1; DNA damage response; MYC; MYCN; Neuroblastoma; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA); Replication stress.
Small-molecule inhibitors of the Wnt pathway potently promote cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm.,Circ Res, 2011 Aug 5,21737789,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21737789/,Rationale:Human embryonic stem cells can form cardiomyocytes when cultured under differentiation conditions. Although the initiating step of mesoderm formation is well characterized， the subsequent steps that promote for cardiac lineages are poorly understood and limit the yield of cardiomyocytes.Objective:Our aim was to develop a human embryonic stem cell-based high-content screening assay to discover small molecules that drive cardiogenic differentiation after mesoderm is established to improve our understanding of the biology involved. Screening of libraries of small-molecule pathway modulators was predicted to provide insight into the cellular proteins and signaling pathways that control stem cell cardiogenesis.Methods and results:Approximately 550 known pathway modulators were screened in a high-content screening assay， with hits being called out by the appearance of a red fluorescent protein driven by the promoter of the cardiac-specific MYH6 gene. One potent small molecule was identified that inhibits transduction of the canonical Wnt response within the cell， which demonstrated that Wnt inhibition alone was sufficient to generate cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm cells. Transcriptional profiling of inhibitor-treated compared with vehicle-treated samples further indicated that inhibition of Wnt does not induce other mesoderm lineages. Notably， several other Wnt inhibitors were very efficient in inducing cardiogenesis， including a molecule that prevents Wnts from being secreted by the cell， which confirmed that Wnt inhibition was the relevant biological activity.Conclusions:Pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling is sufficient to drive human mesoderm cells to form cardiomyocytes; this could yield novel tools for the benefit of pharmaceutical and clinical applications.

Pathways leading to phosphorylation of p450c17 and to the posttranslational regulation of androgen biosynthesis.,Endocrinology, 2008 May,18187541,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18187541/,Cytochrome P450c17 (P450c17) is the single enzyme that catalyzes steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17，20 lyase activities and hence is the crucial decision-making step that determines the class of steroid made in a steroidogenic cell. Although both activities are catalyzed on a single active site， the ratio of these activities is regulated by posttranslational events. Serine phosphorylation of P450c17 increases 17，20 lyase activity by increasing the enzyme's affinity for its redox partner， P450 oxidoreductase. We searched for the relevant kinase(s) that phosphorylates P450c17 by microarray studies and by testing of kinase inhibitors. Microarrays show that 145 of the 278 known serine/threonine kinases are expressed in human adrenal NCI-H295A cells， only six of which were induced more than 2-fold by treatment with 8-Br-cAMP. Key components of the ERK1/2 and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 pathways， which have been implicated in the insulin resistance of PCOS， were not found in NCI-H295A cells， implying that these pathways do not participate in P450c17 phosphorylation. Treatment with various kinase inhibitors that probe the protein kinase A/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and the calcium/calmodulin/MAPK kinase pathway had no effect on the ratio of 17，20 lyase activity to 17alpha-hydroxylase activity， appearing to eliminate these pathways as candidates leading to the phosphorylation of P450c17. Two inhibitors that target the Rho-associated， coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK)/Rho pathway suppressed 17，20 lyase activity and P450c17 phosphorylation， both in NCI-H295A cells and in COS-1 cells transfected with a P450c17 expression vector. ROCK1 phosphorylated P450c17 in vitro， but that phosphorylation did not affect 17，20 lyase activity. We conclude that members of the ROCK/Rho pathway act upstream from the kinase that phosphorylates P450c17 in a fashion that augments 17，20 lyase activity， possibly acting to catalyze a priming phosphorylation.
Antiproliferative effects of imatinib mesylate on ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines via PDGFR-beta， PDGF-BB， c-Kit and SCF expression.,Int J Mol Med, 2018 Jul,29620139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29620139/,Imatinib mesylate is an anti‑neoplastic targeted chemotherapeutic agent， which can inhibit tyrosine kinase receptors， including BCR‑ABL， platelet‑derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and c‑Kit. Cellular processes， including differentiation， proliferation and survival are regulated by these receptors. The present study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of imatinib mesylate， and its effects on apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cell lines. In addition， the study aimed to determine whether the effects of this drug were associated with the mRNA and protein expression levels of PDGFR‑β， c‑Kit， and their corresponding ligands PDGF‑BB and stem cell factor (SCF)， which may potentially modulate cell survival and proliferation. To assess the antiproliferative effects of imatinib mesylate， an MTS assay was conducted following treatment of cells with 2‑10 µM imatinib mesylate for 96， 120 and 144 h; accordingly the half maximal inhibitory concentration of imatinib mesylate was calculated for each cell line. In addition， the proapoptotic effects and cytostatic activity of imatinib mesylate were investigated. To evaluate the expression of imatinib‑targeted genes， PDGFR‑β， c‑Kit， PDGF‑BB and SCF， under imatinib mesylate treatment， mRNA expression was detected using semi‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein expression was detected by western blot analysis in ZR‑75‑1 and MDA‑MB‑231 breast carcinoma cell lines. Treatment with imatinib mesylate suppressed cell proliferation， which was accompanied by apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest in the investigated cell lines. In addition， PDGFR‑β， PDGF‑BB， c‑Kit and SCF were expressed in both breast carcinoma cell lines; PDGFR‑β and c‑Kit， as imatinib targets， were downregulated in response to imatinib mesylate treatment. The present results revealed that at least two potential targets of imatinib mesylate were expressed in the two breast carcinoma cell lines studied. In conclusion， the antiproliferative， cytostatic and proapoptotic effects of imatinib mesylate may be the result of a reduction in the expression of c‑Kit and PDGFR tyrosine kinase receptors， thus resulting in suppression of the corresponding ligand PDGF‑BB. Therefore， imatinib mesylate may be considered a promising target therapy for the future treatment of breast cancer.

Co-regulation of p16INK4A and migratory genes in culture conditions that lead to premature senescence in human keratinocytes.,J Invest Dermatol, 2005 Sep,16117791,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16117791/,Cellular stasis， also known as telomere-independent senescence， prevents many epithelial cells from becoming immortalized by telomerase alone. As human keratinocytes age in culture， protein levels of the tumor suppressor p16INK4a continue to increase， resulting in growth arrest independent of telomere length. Differences in culture conditions have been shown to modulate both p16INK4a expression and replicative capacity of human keratinocytes; however， the mechanism of p16INK4a induction under these conditions is unknown. Using multiple primary keratinocyte cell strains， we verified a delay in p16INK4a induction and an extended lifespan of human keratinocytes when grown in co-culture with post-mitotic fibroblast feeder cells as compared with keratinocytes grown on tissue culture plastic alone. Evaluation of gene expression levels in the two culture conditions by microarray analysis， and subsequent validation， demonstrated that keratinocytes cultured on plastic alone had significantly increased expression of many genes involved in keratinocyte migration and reduced expression levels of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Higher levels of p16INK4a expression were present in cells that also displayed increased amounts of autophosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and urokinase plaminogen activator receptor (uPAR)， both markers of keratinocyte migration. Furthermore， when tyrosine phosphorylation or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPAR function was inhibited， both keratinocyte migration and p16INK4a expression were reduced. Our results indicate that keratinocytes cultured in the absence of feeder cells exhibit a migratory phenotype and suggest that p16INK4a is selectively induced under these conditions by a mechanism involving tyrosine kinase activity and the urokinase plasminogen activation system.

All-trans retinoic acid induces p62DOK1 and p56DOK2 expression which enhances induced differentiation and G0 arrest of HL-60 leukemia cells.,Am J Hematol, 2006 Aug,16823827,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16823827/,p62(DOK1) (DOK1) and p56(DOK2) (DOK2) are sequence homologs that act as docking proteins downstream of receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Originally identified in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells as a highly phosphorylated substrate for the chimeric p210(bcr-abl) protein， DOK1 was suspected to play a role in leukemogenesis. However， p62(DOK1-/-) fibroblast knockout cells were found to have enhanced MAPK signaling and proliferation due to growth factors， suggesting negative regulatory capabilities for DOK1. The role of DOK1 and DOK2 in leukemogeneis thus is enigmatic. The data in this report show that both the DOK1 and the DOK2 adaptor proteins are constitutively expressed in the myelomonoblastic leukemia cell line， HL-60， and that expression of both proteins is induced by the chemotherapeutic differentiation causing agents， all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). Ectopic expression of either protein enhances atRA- or VD3-induced growth arrest， differentiation， and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and results in increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. DOK1 and DOK2 are similarly effective in these capabilities. The data provide evidence that DOK1 and DOK2 proteins have a similar role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and are positive regulators of the MAPK signaling pathway in this context.

hCG-induced down-regulation of PPARγ and liver X receptors promotes periovulatory progesterone synthesis by macaque granulosa cells.,Endocrinology, 2010 Dec,20926582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20926582/,n ovulatory stimulus induces the rapid and dramatic increase in progesterone synthesis by the primate ovarian follicle. However， little is known about the early events leading to the shift from estrogen to progesterone production. Because steroidogenesis represents an aspect of cholesterol metabolism， it was hypothesized that transcription factors regulating cholesterol balance would be among the earliest to change in response to an ovulatory stimulus. Granulosa cells were isolated from rhesus monkey follicles following controlled ovarian stimulation protocols before or up to 24 hr after an ovulatory human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) bolus. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARG) and the liver X receptors [nuclear receptor (NR)1H2， NR1H3] decreased within 3 hr of hCG， as did the reverse cholesterol transporters ATP-binding cassette (ABC)A1 and ABCG1. Treatment of granulosa cells isolated before an ovulatory stimulus with hCG and rosiglitizone resulted in an increase in NR1H3 and ABCG1， and decreased steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein and scavenger receptor-BI (SCARB1). A liver X receptor agonist attenuated hCG-induced progesterone synthesis in vitro and increased the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1， and suppressed STAR， P450 side-chain cleavage A1， hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3B， and SCARB1. These data suggest that an initial action of LH/CG on the primate preovulatory follicle is to rapidly reduce the expression of PPARG， resulting in reduced NR1H3 with the consequence shifting the balance from cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 and ABCG1 to cholesterol uptake (SCARB1) and metabolism (STAR， P450 side-chain cleavage A1， hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3B). That the regulation of PPARG and the liver X receptors occurs within 3 hr strongly indicates that early events in the primate luteinizing follicle are critical to successful ovulation and luteal formation.
Phenotypic reversion of invasive neurofibromin-deficient schwannoma by FTS: Ras inhibition reduces BMP4/Erk/Smad signaling.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2011 Aug,21632464,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21632464/,Neurofibromin-deficient (Nf1(-/-)) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly invasive， refractory to chemotherapy， and characterized by overactivated Ras. Ras activates mitogenic pathways and regulates morphogenic programs--such as those induced by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and TGF-β. The role of such a cross-talk in determining the phenotype and transformation potential of MPNSTs is unknown. Here， we used MPNST cell lines and selective Ras inhibition with S-trans，trans-farnesylthiosalicylic-acid (FTS; salirasib) in conjunction with specific inhibitors of TGF-β and BMP signaling. FTS perturbed signaling of BMP4 and TGF-β1 to Smad-dependent and Erk-dependent pathways. Furthermore， FTS inhibited motility and spreading， reduced the gelatinase secretion， eliminated the expression and activation of regulators of cell-matrix interaction， and altered gene expression. These phenomena are indicative of a phenotypic reversion of NF1-deficient cells by FTS. Inhibition of BMP4 and TGF-β by noggin and SB-431542， respectively， mimicked the FTS-mediated effects on adhesion， spreading， and cell morphology. This strongly suggests that a cross-talk among TGF-β superfamily ligands and Ras plays a significant role in the transformation of NF1(-/-) MPNSTs. Our results support the therapeutic potential of FTS， in conjuncture with BMP and TGF-β pathway inhibitors， toward the inhibition of mitogenic and morphogenic signaling pathways and the alleviation of NF1 symptoms.

Comprehensive protein tyrosine phosphatase mRNA profiling identifies new regulators in the progression of glioma.,Acta Neuropathol Commun, 2016 Sep 1,27586084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27586084/,The infiltrative behavior of diffuse gliomas severely reduces therapeutic potential of surgical resection and radiotherapy， and urges for the identification of new drug-targets affecting glioma growth and migration. To address the potential role of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)， we performed mRNA expression profiling for 91 of the 109 known human PTP genes on a series of clinical diffuse glioma samples of different grades and compared our findings with in silico knowledge from REMBRANDT and TCGA databases. Overall PTP family expression levels appeared independent of characteristic genetic aberrations associated with lower grade or high grade gliomas. Notably， seven PTP genes (DUSP26， MTMR4， PTEN， PTPRM， PTPRN2， PTPRT and PTPRZ1) were differentially expressed between grade II-III gliomas and (grade IV) glioblastomas. For DUSP26， PTEN， PTPRM and PTPRT， lower expression levels correlated with poor prognosis， and overexpression of DUSP26 or PTPRT in E98 glioblastoma cells reduced tumorigenicity. Our study represents the first in-depth analysis of PTP family expression in diffuse glioma subtypes and warrants further investigations into PTP-dependent signaling events as new entry points for improved therapy.Keywords:Astrocytoma; DUSP26; EGFR; Glioblastoma; IDH1; MTMR4; Malignancy; Oligodendroglioma; PTEN; PTP; PTPRM; PTPRN2; PTPRT; PTPRZ1.

Differentiation potential and profile of nuclear receptor expression during expanded culture of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells reveals PPARgamma as an important regulator of Oct4 expression.,Stem Cells Dev, 2014 Jan 1,23998797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23998797/,Potential therapeutic use of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hADSCs) requires the production of large cell numbers by in vitro expansion. However， long-term in vitro culture is associated with reduced stem cell characteristics and differentiation capability. We investigated the proliferation rate and expression of p16(INK4a) mRNA， surface stem cell markers， and stem cell transcription factors. The proliferation rate decreased significantly as passages increased， and the expression of p16(INK4a) mRNA significantly increased. FACS analysis of CD73， CD90， and CD105 expression showed no significant difference among examined passages; however， the mRNA expression levels of pluripotent markers， Oct4 and Nanog， were significantly decreased at higher passages. At passages 12 and 20， there was decreased differentiation capability into insulin-producing cells， evidenced by significantly decreased expression of insulin and related β cell markers. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation was also decreased at higher passages. We then analyzed the transcriptional expression profiles of 48 nuclear receptors at four different passages. We found that the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and thyroid hormone receptor TRβ was significantly decreased at higher passages. Treatment with PPARγ activators or overexpression of PPARγ in hADSCs at passage 20 could recover Oct4 expression levels and increase Oct4 promoter activity. PPARγ inactivation by GW9662 inhibited the troglitazone-induced Oct4 mRNA expression. Furthermore， PPARγ overexpression in hADSC at passage 20 improved the differentiation potential to insulin-producing cells. In conclusion， we demonstrated that hADSCs undergo characteristic changes and reduction of differentiation capability during expanded culture in vitro， and revealed the role of PPARγ as one potential factor in the regulation of Oct4 expression during in vitro aging of hADSCs.
IRF-1 expression is induced by cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells and limits drug effectiveness.,Eur J Cancer, 2013 Mar,23079474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23079474/,Background:The Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) are transcription factors involved in immune responses and oncogenesis and most of them are classified as tumour suppressors. The expression and activation of IRF(s) are stimulated by several cytokines and by DNA damage. Here we examine the role of the IRF-1 in the response of ovarian cancer cells to the front-line chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (CDDP).Methods:We evaluated the transcriptional response of three ovarian cancer cell lines to CDDP both under control conditions and after IRF-1 silencing using expression microarrays. The role played by IRF-1 in the response of these cells to CDDP was evaluated after silencing and overexpressing IRF-1. We studied cell cycle progression， colony forming ability in monolayer culture and semisolid medium， and apoptosis in the response to the drug.Results:The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with CDDP boosted the expression and the nuclear translocation of IRF-1， which in turn modulated the expression of putative IRF-1 target genes. Accordingly， IRF-1 silencing re-orchestrated the expression profiles of CDDP-treated cells. In agreement with its role as a tumour suppressor， overexpressing IRF-1 suppressed the transformed phenotype of ovarian cancer cells. Nevertheless， IRF-1 silencing sensitized cells to the apoptotic death induced by CDDP. Over-expression was associated with cell G1 arrest and p21 induction irrespective of p53 proficiency， while IRF-1 silencing reduced the induction of p21 by CDDP.Conclusions:These data demonstrate that IRF-1 is up-regulated by CDDP in ovarian cancer cells and might limit the cell response to CDDP， likely by inhibiting cell proliferation. Data suggest that IRF-1 induction might interfere with the effectiveness of combination therapy with platinum drugs and cytokines.
Comprehensive genomic profiling of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas identifies recurrent RAF fusions and frequent inactivation of DNA repair genes.,Cancer Discov, 2014 Dec,25266736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266736/,Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (PACC) account for approximately 1% (∼500 cases) of pancreatic cancer diagnoses annually in the United States. Oncogenic therapuetic targets have proven elusive in this disease， and chemotherapy and radiotherapy have demonstrated limited efficacy against these tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a large series of PACCs (n=44) identified recurrent rearrangements involving BRAF and RAF1 (CRAF) in approximately 23% of tumors. The most prevalent fusion， SND1-BRAF， resulted in activation of the MAPK pathway， which was abrogated with MEK inhibition. SND1-BRAF-transformed cells were sensitive to treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. PACCs lacking RAF rearrangements were significantly enriched for genomic alterations， causing inactivation of DNA repair genes (45%); these genomic alterations have been associated with sensitivity to platinum-based therapies and PARP inhibitors. Collectively， these results identify potentially actionable genomic alterations in the majority of PACCs and provide a rationale for using personalized therapies in this disease.Significance:PACC is genomically distinct from other pancreatic cancers. Fusions in RAF genes and mutually exclusive inactivation of DNA repair genes represent novel potential therapeutic targets that are altered in over two thirds of these tumors.
HOXD8 drives Glioma progression through epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulation: Implications for prognosis and targeted therapy.,Exp Cell Res, 2025 Mar 15,39978718,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39978718/,Glioma is one of the most common primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Here， we defined Homeobox D8 (HOXD8) as a novel biomarker for glioma utilizing RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. HOXD8 expression was significantly upregulated in glioma cell lines (U251 and U373) and clinical specimens compared to normal controls. Functional studies demonstrated that HOXD8 knockdown markedly inhibited glioma cell proliferation， migration， and invasion in vitro. Additionally， pan-cancer analysis revealed significant associations between HOXD8 expression and key tumor characteristics， including immune cell infiltratio， tumor mutational burde， and microsatellite instability. Meanwhile， transcriptomic profiling and pathway analysis identified HOXD8's involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation， with Western blot validation showing significant modulation of EMT markers following HOXD8 knockdown. Collectively， our results suggests that HOXD8 may serve as a satisfactory prognostic biomarker that promotes glioma cell proliferation， migration and invasion， potentially through regulation of EMT processes.Keywords:Biomarker; EMT; Glioma; HOXD8; Pan-cancer.
Expression， pharmacology， and functional role of somatostatin receptor subtypes 1 and 2 in human macrophages.,J Leukoc Biol, 2007 Mar,17148691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17148691/,Somatostatin (SRIF)-14 is recognized as an important mediator between the nervous and the immune system， although the functional role of its receptors (sst(1)-sst(5)) is poorly understood in humans. In our study， we demonstrate that human macrophages， differentiated from PBMC-derived monocytes， express sst(1) and sst(2) mRNAs. sst(1) and sst(2) are mostly localized at the cell surface and display active binding sites. In particular， sst(1)/sst(2) activation results in a weak internalization of sst(1)， and the sst(2) internalization appears more efficient. At the functional level， the activation of SRIF receptors by the multiligand analogs SOM230 and KE108， but not by SRIF-14 or cortistatin-14， reduces macrophage viability. Their effects are mimicked by the selective activation of sst(1) and sst(2) using CH-275 and SMS 201-995/L-779，976， respectively. Further， sst(1)- and sst(2)-mediated effects are reversed by the sst(1) antagonist SRA-880 or the sst(2) antagonist CYN 154806， respectively. CH-275， SMS 201-995， and L-779，976， but not SRIF-14， decrease mRNA expression and secretion of the MCP-1. In addition， SRIF-14， CH-275， SMS 201-995， and L-779，976 decrease IL-8 secretion， and they do not affect IL-8 mRNA expression. In contrast， SRIF-14 and sst(1)/sst(2) agonists do not affect the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Collectively， our results suggest that the SRIF system， through sst(1) and sst(2)， exerts mainly an immunosuppressive effect in human macrophages and may， therefore， represent a therapeutic window that can be exploited for the development of new strategies in pharmacological therapy of inflammation.
Gene expression in human neural stem cells: effects of leukemia inhibitory factor.,J Neurochem, 2003 Jul,12807438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12807438/,Human neural precursor cells grown in culture provide a source of tissue for drug screening， developmental studies and cell therapy. However， mechanisms underlying their growth and differentiation are poorly understood. We show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) responsive precursors derived from the developing human cortex undergo senescence after 30-40 population doublings. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) increased overall expansion rates， prevented senescence and allowed the growth of a long-term self renewing neural stem cell (ltNSCctx) for up to 110 population doublings. We established basal gene expression in ltNSCctx using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays that delineated specific members of important growth factor and signaling families consistently expressed across three separate lines. Following LIF withdrawal， 200 genes showed significant decreases. Protein analysis confirmed LIF-regulated expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein， CD44， and major histocompatibility complex I. This study provides the first molecular profile of human ltNSCctx cultures capable of long-term self renewal， and reveals specific sets of genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by LIF.
iASPP mediates p53 selectivity through a modular mechanism fine-tuning DNA recognition.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2019 Aug 27,31395738,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31395738/,
A Computational Systems Biology Approach for Identifying Candidate Drugs for Repositioning for Cardiovascular Disease.,Interdiscip Sci, 2018 Jun,27778232,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27778232/,We report an in silico method to screen for receptors or pathways that could be targeted to elicit beneficial transcriptional changes in a cellular model of a disease of interest. In our method， we integrate: (1) a dataset of transcriptome responses of a cell line to a panel of drugs; (2) two sets of genes for the disease; and (3) mappings between drugs and the receptors or pathways that they target. We carried out a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) test for each of the two gene sets against a list of genes ordered by fold-change in response to a drug in a relevant cell line (HL60)， with the overall score for a drug being the difference of the two enrichment scores. Next， we applied GSEA for drug targets based on drugs that have been ranked by their differential enrichment scores. The method ranks drugs by the degree of anti-correlation of their gene-level transcriptional effects on the cell line with the genes in the disease gene sets. We applied the method to data from (1) CMap 2.0; (2) gene sets from two transcriptome profiling studies of atherosclerosis; and (3) a combined dataset of drug/target information. Our analysis recapitulated known targets related to CVD (e.g.， PPARγ; HMG-CoA reductase， HDACs) and novel targets (e.g.， amine oxidase A， δ-opioid receptor). We conclude that combining disease-associated gene sets， drug-transcriptome-responses datasets and drug-target annotations can potentially be useful as a screening tool for diseases that lack an accepted cellular model for in vitro screening.Keywords:Atherosclerosis; Bioinformatics; Drug repositioning; Gene expression analysis.
Activation of non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway by Wnt3a is associated with differentiation fate determination of human bone marrow stromal (mesenchymal) stem cells.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2011 Sep 16,21875572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21875572/,The canonical Wnt signaling pathway can determine human bone marrow stromal (mesenchymal) stem cell (hMSC) differentiation fate into osteoblast or adipocyte lineages. However， its downstream targets in MSC are not well characterized. Thus， using DNA microarrays， we compared global gene expression patterns induced by Wnt3a treatment in two hMSC lines: hMSC-LRP5(T253) and hMSC-LRP5(T244) cells carrying known mutations of Wnt co-receptor LRP5 (T253I or T244M) that either enhances or represses canonical Wnt signaling， respectively. Wnt3a treatment of hMSC activated not only canonical Wnt signaling， but also the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway through upregulation of several non-canonical Wnt components e.g. naked cuticle 1 homolog (NKD1) and WNT11. Activation of the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway by anisomycin enhanced osteoblast differentiation whereas its inhibition by SP600125 enhanced adipocyte differentiation of hMSC. In conclusion， canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling cooperate in determining MSC differentiation fate.
The P-glycoprotein repertoire of the equine parasitic nematode Parascaris univalens.,Sci Rep, 2020 Aug 12,32788636,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32788636/,P-glycoproteins (Pgp) have been proposed as contributors to the widespread macrocyclic lactone (ML) resistance in several nematode species including a major pathogen of foals， Parascaris univalens. Using new and available RNA-seq data， ten different genomic loci encoding Pgps were identified and characterized by transcriptome-guided RT-PCRs and Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an ascarid-specific Pgp lineage， Pgp-18， as well as two paralogues of Pgp-11 and Pgp-16. Comparative gene expression analyses in P. univalens and Caenorhabditis elegans show that the intestine is the major site of expression but individual gene expression patterns were not conserved between the two nematodes. In P. univalens， PunPgp-9， PunPgp-11.1 and PunPgp-16.2 consistently exhibited the highest expression level in two independent transcriptome data sets. Using RNA-Seq， no significant upregulation of any Pgp was detected following in vitro incubation of adult P. univalens with ivermectin suggesting that drug-induced upregulation is not the mechanism of Pgp-mediated ML resistance. Expression and functional analyses of PunPgp-2 and PunPgp-9 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide evidence for an interaction with ketoconazole and ivermectin， but not thiabendazole. Overall， this study established reliable reference gene models with significantly improved annotation for the P. univalens Pgp repertoire and provides a foundation for a better understanding of Pgp-mediated anthelmintic resistance.
EGFR and PDGFRA co-expression and heterodimerization in glioblastoma tumor sphere lines.,Sci Rep, 2017 Aug 22,28831081,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28831081/,Concurrent amplifications of EGFR and PDGFRA have been reported in up to 5% of glioblastoma (GBM) and it remains unclear why such independent amplification events， and associated receptor overexpression， would be adaptive during glioma evolution. Here， we document that EGFR and PDGFRA protein co-expression occurs in 37% of GBM. There is wide cell-to-cell variation in the expressions of these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in stable tumor sphere lines， frequently defining tumor cell subpopulations with distinct sensitivities to growth factors and RTK inhibitors. We also find evidence for functional transactivation of PDGFRA by EGFR and EGF-induced receptor heterodimerization， both of which are abolished by EGFR inhibitors. These results indicate that GBM growth responses to targeted therapies previously tested in clinical trials are strongly influenced by the balance of EGFR and PDGFRA activation in individual cells， which is heterogeneous at baseline.
Immunomodulatory effect of thymopentin on lymphocytes from supramammary lymph nodes of dairy cows.,Immunol Lett, 2019 Dec,31520655,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31520655/,Previous study showed that injection of thymopentin (TP 5) in the area of supramammary lymph nodes (SMLN) had therapeutic effect on the intramammary infection (IMI) in cows. This study was to explore the underlying mechanisms by investigating the immunomodulatory effect of TP 5 on SMLN lymphocytes. Lymphocyte proliferation， cell cycle distribution and cytokine mRNA expression were determined by MTT， FCM and RT-qPCR， respectively. Laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) was used to observe the binding between TP 5 and SMLN lymphocytes. Moreover， RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to observe the difference between the lymphocytes with and without TP 5 treatment. The results showed that TP 5 significantly promoted lymphocyte proliferation， accelerated cell cycle progression， and enhanced mRNA expression of IL-17A and IL-17F. Laser scanning confocal microscopic analysis revealed the binding of TP 5 to the surface of SMLN lymphocytes. A total of 1094 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using RNA-seq with 692 up- and 402 down-regulated genes. 48 significantly enriched GO terms were identified by RNA-seq. In KEGG analysis， 1/3 of DEGs were enriched in the immune system pathway， including IL-17 signaling pathway， cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction， Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation， T cell receptor signaling pathway， Th17 cell differentiation. Among them， IL-17 signaling pathway was the most prominent. This study suggested that the therapeutic benefit of TP 5 in the treatment of bovine mastitis might be attributed to its immunomodulatory activity in SMLN lymphocytes.Keywords:Mastitis; RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq); Supramammary lymph nodes (SMLN); Thymopentin (TP 5).
Identification of therapeutic miRNAs from the arsenic induced gene expression profile of hepatocellular carcinoma.,Chem Biol Drug Des, 2023 May,36052834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36052834/,Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer， with a rising worldwide burden due to a lack of efficient treatment techniques and diagnosis after it has metastasized. Therefore， small non-coding RNA (miRNAs) as protein translation inhibitors are gaining attention that degrades or suppress specific gene transcripts， making it a prime strategy for oncogenes or tumor suppression. Systematic research with miRNAs in combination with Arsenic， which has been employed as a drug to treat several diseases， including cancer， was focused on cellular responses through interacting with multiple biological targets. The differential gene expression of the DNA microarray dataset (GSE48441) revealed the association of sterol， cholesterol， and lipid metabolic processes. With the aid of the network pharmacology approach， hsa-mir-335-5p was uncovered to negatively regulate the important nodes driving the transport and utilization of essential compounds for the rapid growth and proliferation of cancer cells. The binding energies of the duplexes were validated by the minimal free energies of the mRNAs for hsa-mir-335-5p， indicating energetically desirable binding association. The molecular interactions between hsa-mir-335-5p， which interacts with the Argonaute protein in the RNA induced silencing complex， and the target-specific genes were also investigated， revealing its susceptibility to be employed in in vitro studies.Keywords:Arsenic trioxide; DNA microarray; docking; gene regulation; hepatocellular carcinoma; miRNA; network pharmacology; therapeutics.
Insights Into SMAD4 Loss in Pancreatic Cancer From Inducible Restoration of TGF-β Signaling.,Mol Endocrinol, 2015 Oct,26284758,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26284758/,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The TGF-β signaling protein SMAD family member 4 is lost in 60% of PDAC， and this has been associated with poorer prognosis. However， the mechanisms by which SMAD4 loss promotes PDAC development are not fully understood. We expressed SMAD4 in human PDAC cell lines BxPC3 and CFPAC1 by selection of stable clones containing an inducible SMAD4 tetracycline inducible expression system construct. After 24 hours of SMAD4 expression， TGF-β signaling-dependent G1 arrest was observed in BxPC3 cells with an increase in the G1 phase fraction from 48.9% to 71.5%. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A by small interfering RNA eliminated the antiproliferative effect， indicating that up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A/p21 by TGF-β signaling is necessary for the phenotype. SMAD4 expression had no impact on invasion in BxPC3 cells， but reduced migration. Microarray analysis of gene expression at 8， 24， and 48 hours after SMAD4 expression characterized the regulatory impact of SMAD4 expression in a SMAD4-null PDAC cell line and identified novel targets of TGF-β signaling. Among the novel TGF-β targets identified are anthrax toxin receptor 2 (3.58× at 8 h)， tubulin， β-3 class III (7.35× at 8 h)， cell migration inducing protein， hyaluronan binding (8.07× at 8 h)， IL-1 receptor-like 1 (0.403× at 8 h)， regulator of G protein signaling 4 (0.293× at 8 h)， and THAP domain containing 11 (0.262× at 8 h). The gene expression changes we observed upon restoration of TGF-β signaling provide numerous new targets for future investigations into PDAC biology and progression.
UV-Associated Mutations Underlie the Etiology of MCV-Negative Merkel Cell Carcinomas.,Cancer Res, 2015 Dec 15,26627015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26627015/,Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon， but highly malignant， cutaneous tumor. Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCV) has been implicated in a majority of MCC tumors; however， viral-negative tumors have been reported to be more prevalent in some geographic regions subject to high sun exposure. While the impact of MCV and viral T-antigens on MCC development has been extensively investigated， little is known about the etiology of viral-negative tumors. We performed targeted capture and massively parallel DNA sequencing of 619 cancer genes to compare the gene mutations and copy number alterations in MCV-positive (n = 13) and -negative (n = 21) MCC tumors and cell lines. We found that MCV-positive tumors displayed very low mutation rates， but MCV-negative tumors exhibited a high mutation burden associated with a UV-induced DNA damage signature. All viral-negative tumors harbored mutations in RB1， TP53， and a high frequency of mutations in NOTCH1 and FAT1. Additional mutated or amplified cancer genes of potential clinical importance included PI3K (PIK3CA， AKT1， PIK3CG) and MAPK (HRAS， NF1) pathway members and the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2. Furthermore， looking ahead to potential therapeutic strategies encompassing immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1， we also assessed the status of T-cell-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 in MCC tumors. A subset of viral-negative tumors exhibited high TILs and PD-L1 expression， corresponding with the higher mutation load within these cancers. Taken together， this study provides new insights into the underlying biology of viral-negative MCC and paves the road for further investigation into new treatment opportunities.
Helicobacter pylori induces up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in AGS gastric epithelial cells.,J Infect Dis, 2007 Jul 1,17538889,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17538889/,Background:Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether H. pylori could up-regulate the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)， a critical gene in the carcinogenic process.Methods:AGS gastric epithelial cells were infected with cag(+) toxigenic or cag(-) nontoxigenic strains of H. pylori or isogenic mutants. EGFR protein expression was determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. EGFR mRNA levels were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The signaling pathways leading to EGFR up-regulation were examined using the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059， the Src inhibitor pp2， the nuclear factor- kappa B inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester， EGFR neutralizing antibodies， and the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478.Results:Infection of AGS cells by H. pylori significantly increased EGFR mRNA and protein levels. We found that this effect was limited to cag(+) H. pylori strains and that mutants with a defective type IV secretion system were unable to cause EGFR up-regulation. Increased EGFR expression was found to be dependent on EGFR receptor transactivation， ERK1/2 phosphorylation， and Src activation.Conclusion:Infection of gastric epithelial cells by H. pylori triggers an autocrine loop whereby EGFR transactivation leads to the up-regulation of EGFR expression. This， in turn， may contribute to unrestrained epithelial cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.
Iodine alters gene expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line: evidence for an anti-estrogen effect of iodine.,Int J Med Sci, 2008 Jul 8,18645607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18645607/,The protective effects of iodine on breast cancer have been postulated from epidemiologic evidence and described in animal models. The molecular mechanisms responsible have not been identified but laboratory evidence suggests that iodine may inhibit cancer promotion through modulation of the estrogen pathway. To elucidate the role of iodine in breast cancer， the effect of Lugol's iodine solution (5% I(2)， 10% KI) on gene expression was analyzed in the estrogen responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Microarray analysis identified 29 genes that were up-regulated and 14 genes that were down-regulated in response to iodine/iodide treatment. The altered genes included several involved in hormone metabolism as well as genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression， growth and differentiation. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the array data demonstrating that iodine/iodide treatment increased the mRNA levels of several genes involved in estrogen metabolism (CYP1A1， CYP1B1， and AKR1C1) while decreasing the levels of the estrogen responsive genes TFF1 and WISP2. This report presents the results of the first gene array profiling of the response of a breast cancer cell line to iodine treatment. In addition to elucidating our understanding of the effects of iodine/iodide on breast cancer， this work suggests that iodine/iodide may be useful as an adjuvant therapy in the pharmacologic manipulation of the estrogen pathway in women with breast cancer.Keywords:Breast Cancer; Estrogen; Gene Expression; Hormone Metabolism; Iodine.
CDK9 inhibition strategy defines distinct sets of target genes.,BMC Res Notes, 2014 May 16,24886624,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24886624/,Background:CDK9 is the catalytic subunit of the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb)， which phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII and negative elongation factors enabling for productive elongation after initiation. CDK9 associates with T-type cyclins and cyclin K and its activity is tightly regulated in cells at different levels. CDK9 is also the catalytic subunit of TAK (Tat activating Kinase)， essential for HIV1 replication. Because of CDK9's potential as a therapeutic target in AIDS， cancer， inflammation， and cardiomyophathy it is important to understand the consequences of CDK9 inhibition. A previous gene expression profiling study performed with human glioblastoma T98G cells in which CDK9 activity was inhibited either with a dominant negative mutant form of CDK9 (dnCDK9) or the pharmacological inhibitor Flavopiridol unveiled striking differences in gene expression effects. In the present report we extended these studies by (1) using both immortalized normal human fibroblasts and primary human astrocytes， (2) eliminating potential experimental variability due to transduction methodology and (3) also modulating CDK9 activity with siRNA.Findings:Striking differences in the effects on gene expression resulting from the strategy used to inhibit CDK9 activity (dnCDK9 or FVP) remain even when potential variability due to viral transduction is eliminated. siRNA mediated CDK9 knockdown in human fibroblasts and astrocytes efficiently reduced CDK9 expression and led to potent changes in gene expression that exhibit little correlation with the effects of dnCDK9 or FVP. Interestingly， HEXIM1 a validated CDK9 target gene， was found to be potently downregulated by dnCDK9， FVP and siCDK9， but the cluster of genes with expression profiles similar to HEXIM1 was small. Finally， cluster analysis of all treatments revealed higher correlation between treatments than cell type origin.Conclusion:The nature of the strategy used to inhibit CDK9 profoundly affects the patterns of gene expression resulting from CDK9 inhibition. These results suggest multiple variables that affect outcome， including kinetics of inhibition， potency， off-target effects， and selectivity issues. This is particularly important when considering CDK9 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
Microarray analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiling in response to 2-deoxyglucose， metformin， and glucose starvation.,Cancer Cell Int, 2022 Mar 19,35305635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305635/,Background:Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Altering glucose metabolism and its effects on cancer progression and treatment resistance is an emerging interest in BC research. For instance， combining chemotherapy with glucose-lowering drugs (2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)， metformin (MET)) or glucose starvation (GS) has shown better outcomes than with chemotherapy alone. However， the genes and molecular mechanisms that govern the action of these glucose deprivation conditions have not been fully elucidated. Here， we investigated the differentially expressed genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cell lines upon treatment with glucose-lowering drugs (2-DG， MET) and GS using microarray analysis to study the difference in biological functions between the glucose challenges and their effect on the vulnerability of BC cells.Methods:MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 20 mM MET or 4 mM 2-DG for 48 h. GS was performed by gradually decreasing the glucose concentration in the culture medium to 0 g/L， in which the cells remained with fetal bovine serum for one week. Expression profiling was carried out using Affymetrix Human Clariom S microarrays. Differentially expressed genes were obtained from the Transcriptome Analysis Console and enriched using DAVID and R packages.Results:Our results showed that MDA-MB-231 cells were more responsive to glucose deprivation than MCF-7 cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response and cell cycle inhibition were detected after all three glucose deprivations in MDA-MB-231 cells and only under the metformin and GS conditions in MCF-7 cells. Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of DNA replication were observed with all three treatments in MDA-MB-231 cells and metformin-treated MCF-7 cells. Upregulation of cellular response to reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms resulted after metformin and GS administration in MDA-MB-231 cell lines and metformin-treated MCF-7 cells. Autophagy was induced after 2-DG treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells and after metformin in MCF-7 cells. Finally， inhibition of DNA methylation were observed only with GS in MDA-MB-231 cells.Conclusion:The procedure used to process cancer cells and analyze their expression data distinguishes our study from others. GS had the greatest effect on breast cancer cells compared to 2-DG and MET. Combining MET and GS could restrain both cell lines， making them more vulnerable to conventional chemotherapy.Keywords:2-deoxyglucose; Breast cancer; Glucose starvation; Hormone receptor-positive subtype; Metformin; Microarray; Triple-negative breast cancer.
Alterations in gene expression and sensitivity to genotoxic stress following HdmX or Hdm2 knockdown in human tumor cells harboring wild-type p53.,Aging (Albany NY), 2009 Jan,19946469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19946469/,While half of all human tumors possess p53 mutations， inactivation of wild-type p53 can also occur through a variety of mechanisms that do not involve p53 gene mutation or deletion. Our laboratory has been interested in tumor cells possessing wild-type p53 protein and elevated levels of HdmX and/or Hdm2， two critical negative regulators of p53 function. In this study we utilized RNAi to knockdown HdmX or Hdm2 in MCF7 human breast cancer cells， which harbor wild-type p53 and elevated levels of HdmX and Hdm2 then examined gene expression changes and effects on cell growth.Cell cycle and growth assays confirmed that the loss of either HdmX or Hdm2 led to a significant growth inhibition and G1cell cycle arrest. Although the removal of overexpressed HdmX/2 appears limited to an anti-proliferative effect in MCF7cells， the loss of HdmX and/or Hdm2 enhanced cytotoxicity in these same cells exposed to DNA damage. Through the use of Affymetrix GeneChips and subsequent RT-qPCR validations， we uncovered a subset of anti-proliferative p53 target genes activated upon HdmX/2 knockdown. Interestingly， a second set of genes， normally transactivated by E2F1 as cells transverse the G1-S phase boundary， were found repressed in a p21-dependent manner following HdmX/2 knockdown.Taken together， these results provide novel insights into the reactivation of p53 in cells overexpressing HdmX and Hdm2.Keywords:Hdm2; HdmX; RNAi; gene expression profiling; p53.
Differential gene expression profiles of normal human parotid and submandibular glands.,Oral Dis, 2008 Sep,18826381,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18826381/,Background:Parotid and submandibular glands have different properties including characteristics of the secreted saliva and tumor incidences. The differences in properties of parotid and submandibular glands are not clear from a genetic viewpoint.Objective:To study differential gene expression profiles between normal human parotid and submandibular glands.Materials and methods:Three pairs of normal parotid and submandibular glands were obtained. RNA was extracted from these samples. After reverse transcription， the cDNA was in vitro-transcribed to produce biotin-labeled cRNA. The purified biotin-labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to microarray chips.Results:Among the 54 675 tested transcripts， 47 transcripts were upregulated at least twofold in the parotid gland compared with the submandibular gland， including tumor-associated genes (pleiotrophin， WNT5A， ABCC1) and transport-associated genes (SLCO1A2， SLC13A5， KCNJ15). Ninety-eight transcripts were upregulated at least twofold in the submandibular gland compared with the parotid gland， including the chloride channel CFTR and mucin-associated genes that belong to the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway (GalNAc-T4， GalNAc-T7 and GalNAc-T13). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nine differentially expressed genes confirmed the microarray results.Conclusion:This study revealed the different gene expression profiles of normal human parotid and submandibular glands， providing a genetic basis for their differing properties.

Gene expression in macrophage-rich inflammatory cell infiltrates in human atherosclerotic lesions as studied by laser microdissection and DNA array: overexpression of HMG-CoA reductase， colony stimulating factor receptors， CD11A/CD18 integrins， and interleukin receptors.,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 2003 Dec,14576072,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14576072/,Objective:Inflammatory cells play an important role in atherogenesis. However， more information is needed about their gene expression profiles in human lesions.Methods and results:We used laser microdissection (LMD) to isolate macrophage-rich shoulder areas from human lesions. Gene expression profiles in isolated cells were analyzed by cDNA array and compared with expression patterns in normal intima and THP-1 macrophages. Upregulation of 72 genes was detected with LMD and included 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase， interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF-5)， colony stimulating factor (CSF) receptors， CD11a/CD18 integrins， interleukin receptors， CD43， calmodulin， nitric oxide synthase (NOS)， and extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD). Several of these changes were also present in PMA-stimulated THP-1 macrophages in vitro. On the other hand， expression of several genes， such as VEGF， tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2， and apolipoproteins C-I and C-II， decreased.Conclusions:Overexpression of HMG-CoA reductase in macrophage-rich lesion areas may explain some beneficial effects of statins， which can also modulate increased expression of CD11a/CD18 and CD43 found in microdissected cells. We also found increased expression of CSF receptors， IRF-5， and interleukin receptors， which could become useful therapeutic targets for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases.
Expression of DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B correlates with EZH2 and this 3-marker epigenetic signature predicts outcome in glioblastomas.,Exp Mol Pathol, 2016 Apr,26892683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26892683/,
Glycolytic pathway analysis and gene expression profiles of combination of aloe vera and paclitaxel on non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer.,Med Oncol, 2024 Oct 14,39400682,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39400682/,The purpose of this study is to enhance the effectiveness of known anticancer medications using natural compounds. The study investigated the impact of combining AVE with PAX on non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and breast cancer (MCF7). In this study， A549 and MCF7 cells were treated with PAX (5 μM)， AVE (24 μg/mL)， and a combination of PAX and AVE (5 μM + 24 μg/mL). The glucose consumption rates of the cells were determined by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) thanks to the SeaHorse XFe24 instrument. In addition， gene expression profiles were determined by performing Total RNA sequencing with the Novaseq 6000 instrument. Finally， the expressions of GAPDH， BAX， and BCL-2 genes involved in the apoptotic pathway were detected by RT-qPCR. The combined application of PAX and AVE reduced the ECAR value in both cell lines. According to the RT-qPCR results， the expression level of the apoptotic gene BAX increased in both cell lines (p < 0.05). Total RNA sequencing revealed that the combination effects of PAX and AVE play a role in the ribosome mechanism， thereby affecting the protein translation system in MCF7 while apoptosis and cell cycle have come to the forefront in A549.Keywords:Aloe vera; Breast cancer; Non-small cell lung cancer; Paclitaxel; SeaHorse XFe24 analyzer; Total RNA sequencing.
Transcriptional regulation of CYR61 and CTGF by LM98: a synthetic YAP-TEAD inhibitor that targets in-vitro vasculogenic mimicry in glioblastoma cells.,Anticancer Drugs, 2024 Sep 1,38900643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38900643/,
Chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarray analysis of Smad2/3 binding sites reveals roles of ETS1 and TFAP2A in transforming growth factor beta signaling.,Mol Cell Biol, 2009 Jan,18955504,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18955504/,The Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) proteins are principally involved in the transmission of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Many transcription factors have been shown to cooperate with the Smad2/3 proteins in regulating the transcription of target genes， enabling appropriate gene expression by cells. Here we identified 1，787 Smad2/3 binding sites in the promoter regions of over 25，500 genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarray in HaCaT keratinocytes. Binding elements for the v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ETS) and transcription factor AP-2 (TFAP2) were significantly enriched in Smad2/3 binding sites， and knockdown of either ETS1 or TFAP2A resulted in overall alteration of TGF-beta-induced transcription， suggesting general roles for ETS1 and TFAP2A in the transcription induced by TGF-beta-Smad pathways. We identified novel Smad binding sites in the CDKN1A gene where Smad2/3 binding was regulated by ETS1 and TFAP2A. Moreover， we showed that small interfering RNAs for ETS1 and TFAP2A affected TGF-beta-induced cytostasis. We also analyzed Smad2- or Smad3-specific target genes regulated by TGF-beta and found that their specificity did not appear to be solely determined by the amounts of the Smad2/3 proteins bound to the promoters. These findings reveal novel regulatory mechanisms of Smad2/3-induced transcription and provide an essential resource for understanding their roles.
Identification of SCARA5 Gene as a Potential Immune-Related Biomarker for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer by Integrated Analysis.,DNA Cell Biol, 2020 Oct,32816580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32816580/,
Interferon regulatory factor 3 plays an anti-inflammatory role in microglia by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.,J Neuroinflammation, 2011 Dec 30,22208359,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22208359/,"Background:Microglia are the principal cells involved in the innate immune response in the CNS. Activated microglia produce a number of proinflammatory cytokines implicated in neurotoxicity but they also are a major source of anti-inflammatory cytokines， antiviral proteins and growth factors. Therefore， an immune therapy aiming at suppressing the proinflammatory phenotype while enhancing the anti-inflammatory， growth promoting phenotype would be of great benefit. In the current study， we tested the hypothesis that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)， a transcription factor required for the induction of IFNβ following TLR3 or TLR4 activation， is critical to the microglial phenotype change from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory， and that this phenotype change can be greatly facilitated by IRF3 gene transfer.Methods:Cultures of primary human fetal microglia were transduced with IRF3 using recombinant adenovirus (Ad-IRF3) and subjected to microarray analysis， real-time PCR， immunoblotting and ELISA to determine inflammatory gene expression. Two different types of immune stimuli were tested， the TLR ligands， poly IC (PIC) and LPS， and the proinflammatory cytokines， IL-1/IFNγ. In addition， the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway was examined by use of a pharmacological inhibitor， LY294002.Results:Our results show that Ad-IRF3 suppressed proinflammatory genes (IL-1α， IL-1β， TNFα， IL-6， IL-8 and CXCL1) and enhanced anti-inflammatory genes (IL-1 receptor antagonist， IL-10 and IFNβ) in microglia， regardless of the cell stimuli applied. Furthermore， Ad-IRF3 activated Akt， and LY294002 reversed the effects of Ad-IRF3 on microglial inflammatory gene expression. pAkt was critical in LPS- or PIC-induced production of IL-10 and IL-1ra. Significantly， microglial IFNβ protein production was also dependent on pAkt and required both Ad-IRF3 and immunological stimuli (PIC > IL-1/IFNγ). pAkt played much less prominent and variable roles in microglial proinflammatory gene expression. This anti-inflammatory promoting role of PI3K/Akt appeared to be specific to microglia， since astrocyte proinflammatory gene expression (as well as IFNβ expression) required PI3K/Akt.Conclusions:Our results show a novel anti-inflammatory role for the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in microglia. They further suggest that IRF3 gene therapy could facilitate the microglial phenotype switch from proinflammatory (""M1-like"") to anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory (""M2-like"")， in part， by augmenting the level of pAkt."
Development of a two-step protocol for culture expansion of human annulus fibrosus cells with TGF-β1 and FGF-2.,Stem Cell Res Ther, 2016 Jul 12,27405858,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27405858/,Background:Different biologic approaches to treat disc regeneration， including growth factors (GFs) application， are currently under investigation. Human annulus fibrosus (hAF) repair or regeneration is one of the key elements for maintenance and restoration of nucleus pulposus function. However， so far there is no effective treatment for this purpose. The aim of the present study was to investigate the response of hAF cells to different combinations of GFs， and develop a protocol for efficient culture expansion.Methods:hAF cells were harvested from degenerated disc tissues during surgical intervertebral disc removal， and hAF cells were expanded in a monolayer. The experiments were categorized based on different protocols with transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) culture for 14 days: group 1 had no GFs (control group); group 2 received TGF-β1; group 3 received FGF-2; group 4 received both GFs; and group 5 (two-step) received both GFs for the first 10 days and TGF-β1 only for the next 4 days. Cell proliferation， collagen， and noncollagen extracellular matrix (ECM) production and genes expression were compared among these groups.Results:At days 3， 7 and 10 of cultivation， groups 4 and 5 had significantly more cell numbers and faster cell proliferation rates than groups 1， 2， and 3. At 14 days of cultivation， significantly more cell numbers were observed in groups 3 and 4 than in group 5. The group 4 had the most cell numbers and the fastest proliferation rate at 14 days of cultivation. After normalization for cell numbers， group 5 (two-step) produced the most collagen and noncollagen ECM at 10 and 14 days of cultivation among the five groups. In group 5， ECM gene expression was significantly upregulated. High expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 was upregulated with FGF-2 on the different days as compared to the other groups. Annulus fibrosus cell phenotypes were only marginally retained under the different protocols based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction results.Conclusion:Taken together， the two-step protocol was the most efficient among these different protocols with the most abundant ECM production after normalization for cell numbers for culture expansion of hAF cells. The protocol may be useful in further cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches for disc regeneration.Keywords:Annulus fibrosus; Disc degeneration; FGF-2; Mitogen; Morphogen; TGF-β1; Tissue engineering.

IGF2BP2 stabilized FBXL19-AS1 regulates the blood-tumour barrier permeability by negatively regulating ZNF765 by STAU1-mediated mRNA decay.,RNA Biol, 2020 Dec,32713259,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32713259/,Blood-tumour barrier (BTB) has been known to significantly attenuate the efficacy of chemotherapy for glioma. In this report， we identified that insulin-like grown factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) was over-expressed in glioma microvessel and glioma endothelial cells (GECs). Knockdown of IGF2BP2 decreased the expression of lncRNA FBXL19-AS1 and tight junction-related proteins， thereby promoting BTB permeability. FBXL19-AS1 was over-expressed and more enriched in the cytoplasm of GECs. In addition， FBXL19-AS1 could bind to 3'-UTR of ZNF765 mRNA and down-regulate ZNF765 mRNA expression through STAU1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). The low expression of ZNF765 was discovered in GECs and verified to increase BTB permeability by inhibiting the promoter activities of tight junction-related proteins. Meanwhile， ZNF765 also inhibited the transcriptional activity of IGF2BP2， thereby forming a feedback loop in regulating the BTB permeability. Single or combined application of silenced IGF2BP2 and FBXL19-AS1 improved the delivery and antitumor efficiency of doxorubicin (DOX). In general， our study revealed the regulation mechanism of IGF2BP2/FBXL19-AS1/ZNF765 axis on BTB permeability， which may provide valuable insight into treatment strategy for glioma.Keywords:FBXL19-AS1; IGF2BP2; blood-tumour barrier; stau1-mediated decay.
Molecular changes consistent with increased proliferation and invasion are common in rectal cancer.,Clin Transl Oncol, 2011 Oct,21975339,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21975339/,BACKGROUND Survival in rectal cancer remains unchanged despite improved treatment modalities. Molecular biology may hold the key to new strategies. Gene expression abnormalities need identification in tumour specimens to identify targets for therapy. The impact of neoadjuvant therapy on induced gene expression changes needs to be assessed to distinguish the intrinsic tumour-specific changes from those changes that may be induced by neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS Gene expression changes were examined in 21 rectal tumours plus matched normal mucosa and cells exposed to 5-FU and gamma radiation， using DNA membrane arrays. These arrays contained 100 genes in common cancer pathways. The most commonly up-regulated gene， c-FOS， was quantified using real-time PCR. RESULTS c-FOS was the most commonly up-regulated gene， occurring in 7 of 21 samples (33%)， all samples having a greater than 2-fold increase. SERPINE-1 was the second most commonly up-regulated gene with 6 of 21 samples showing up-regulation (29%). There was no clear correlation between up-regulation of c-FOS or SERPINE-1 and clinico-pathological data. Neither c-FOS nor SERPINE-1 gene expression was induced by 5-FU treatment or gamma irradiation in vitro， but MUC 18 was up-regulated by 5-FU treatment. This suggests that FOS and SERPINE-1 expression changes are specific to the tumour and will not arise as artefacts of neoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION The study suggests that c-FOS and SERPINE-1 may have important but as yet unclear roles in the tumour biology of rectal cancer but probably only represent a small part of the complex molecular biology of rectal cancer.
Elevated NCOR1 disrupts PPARalpha/gamma signaling in prostate cancer and forms a targetable epigenetic lesion.,Carcinogenesis, 2010 Sep,20466759,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20466759/,The loss of anti-proliferative responsiveness in prostate cancer cell lines toward ligands for vitamin D receptor， retinoic acid receptors/retinoid X receptors and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)alpha/gamma may entail underlying epigenetic events， as ligand insensitivity reflects significantly altered messenger RNA expression of corepressors and histone-modifying enzymes. Expression patterns were dependent on phases of the cell cycle and associated with repressed basal gene expression of vitamin D receptor and PPARalpha/gamma target genes， for example CDKN1A [encodes p21((waf1/cip1))]. Elevated nuclear corepressor 1 (NCOR1) and nuclear corepressor 2/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor protein levels were detected in prostate cancer cell lines compared with non-malignant counterparts. Knockdown of the corepressor NCOR1 significantly elevated basal expression of a cohort of target genes， including CDKN1A. Both chemical [histone deacetylases inhibitor (HDACi)] and NCOR1 knockdown targeting enhanced anti-proliferative sensitivity toward PPARalpha/gamma ligands in prostate cancer cell lines. Pursuing PPARalpha/gamma signaling， microarray approaches were undertaken to identify pathways and genes regulated uniquely by a combination of PPARalpha/gamma activation and HDAC inhibition. Again， HDACi and knockdown approaches demonstrated that elevated NCOR1 expression and activity distorted PPARalpha/gamma gene targets centered on， for example cell cycle control， including CDKN1A and TGFBRAP1. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction validation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays both confirmed that elevated NCOR1 disrupted the ability of PPARalpha/gamma to regulate key target genes (CDKN1A and TGFBRAP1). Interrogation of these relationships in prostate cancer samples using principal component and partial correlation analyses established significant interdependent relationships between NCOR1-PPARalpha/gamma and representative target genes， independently of androgen receptor expression. Therefore， we conclude that elevated NCOR1 distorts the actions of PPARalpha/gamma selectively and generates a potential epigenetic lesion with diagnostic and prognostic significance.

Pharmacologic induction of innate immune signaling directly drives homologous recombination deficiency.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2020 Jul 28,32651270,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32651270/,Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have efficacy in triple negative breast (TNBC) and ovarian cancers (OCs) harboring BRCA mutations， generating homologous recombination deficiencies (HRDs). DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) increase PARP trapping and reprogram the DNA damage response to generate HRD， sensitizing BRCA-proficient cancers to PARPi. We now define the mechanisms through which HRD is induced in BRCA-proficient TNBC and OC. DNMTi in combination with PARPi up-regulate broad innate immune and inflammasome-like signaling events， driven in part by stimulator of interferon genes (STING)， to unexpectedly directly generate HRD. This inverse relationship between inflammation and DNA repair is critical， not only for the induced phenotype， but also appears as a widespread occurrence in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets and cancer subtypes. These discerned interactions between inflammation signaling and DNA repair mechanisms now elucidate how epigenetic therapy enhances PARPi efficacy in the setting of BRCA-proficient cancer. This paradigm will be tested in a phase I/II TNBC clinical trial.Keywords:DNA methyltransferase inhibitors; Fanconi anemia; homologous recombination deficiency; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors; stimulator of interferon signaling.

Deep sequencing reveals new aspects of progesterone receptor signaling in breast cancer cells.,PLoS One, 2014 Jun 4,24897521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24897521/,Despite the pleiotropic effects of the progesterone receptor in breast cancer， the molecular mechanisms in play remain largely unknown. To gain a global view of the PR-orchestrated networks， we used next-generation sequencing to determine the progestin-regulated transcriptome in T47D breast cancer cells. We identify a large number of PR target genes involved in critical cellular programs， such as regulation of transcription， apoptosis， cell motion and angiogenesis. Integration of the transcriptomic data with the PR-binding profiling of hormonally treated cells identifies numerous components of the small-GTPases signaling pathways as direct PR targets. Progestin-induced deregulation of the small GTPases may contribute to the PR's role in mammary tumorigenesis. Transcript expression analysis reveals significant expression changes of specific transcript variants in response to the extracellular hormonal stimulus. Using the NET1 gene as an example， we show that the PR can dictate alternative promoter usage leading to the upregulation of an isoform that may play a role in metastatic breast cancer. Future studies should aim to characterize these selectively regulated variants and evaluate their clinical utility in prognosis and targeted therapy of hormonally responsive breast tumors.

Omics-based identification of an NRF2-related auranofin resistance signature in cancer: Insights into drug repurposing.,Comput Biol Med, 2023 Jan,36493734,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36493734/,uranofin is a thioredoxin reductase-1 inhibitor originally approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Recently， auranofin has been repurposed as an anticancer drug， with pharmacological activity reported in multiple cancer types. In this study， we characterized transcriptional and genetic alterations associated with auranofin response in cancer. By integrating data from an auranofin cytotoxicity screen with transcriptome profiling of lung cancer cell lines， we identified an auranofin resistance signature comprising 29 genes， most of which are classical targets of the transcription factor NRF2， such as genes involved in glutathione metabolism (GCLC， GSR， SLC7A11) and thioredoxin system (TXN， TXNRD1). Pan-cancer analysis revealed that mutations in NRF2 pathway genes， namely KEAP1 and NFE2L2， are strongly associated with overexpression of the auranofin resistance gene set. By clustering cancer types based on auranofin resistance signature expression， hepatocellular carcinoma， and a subset of non-small cell lung cancer， head-neck squamous cell carcinoma， and esophageal cancer carrying NFE2L2/KEAP1 mutations were predicted resistant， whereas leukemia， lymphoma， and multiple myeloma were predicted sensitive to auranofin. Cell viability assays in a panel of 20 cancer cell lines confirmed the augmented sensitivity of hematological cancers to auranofin; an effect associated with dependence upon glutathione and decreased expression of NRF2 target genes involved in GSH synthesis and recycling (GCLC， GCLM and GSR) in these cancer types. In summary， the omics-based identification of sensitive/resistant cancers and genetic alterations associated with these phenotypes may guide an appropriate repurposing of auranofin in cancer therapy.Keywords:Auranofin; Gene signature; KEAP1 mutation; NRF2 pathway; Pan-cancer; Sensitivity.
Synthesis and evaluation of the antiproliferative efficacy of BRM270 phytocomposite nanoparticles against human hepatoma cancer cell lines.,Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl, 2019 Apr,30678901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30678901/,BRM270 is the most leading phytochemical extract that possesses potent anticancer properties. A major challenge associated with this drug is its low bioavailability and thus requires high dosages for cancer treatment. Here， we report the novel nano-synthesis of phyto-composite， BRM270 for the first time by mechanical milling method with specific modifications for enhanced cytotoxicity against HepG2 human hepatoma cancer cells. Unlike free BRM270 and other phytomedicines， BRM270 nanoparticles (BRM270 NPs) are well-dispersed and small sized (23 to 70 nm) which is believed to greatly enhanced cellular uptake. Furthermore， the acidic tumor microenvironment attracts BRM270 NPs enhancing targeted therapy while leaving normal cells less affected. The comparative cytotoxicity analysis using MTT assay among the three treatment groups， such as free BRM270， BRM270 NPs， and doxorubicin demonstrated that BRM270 NPs induced greater cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an effective drug concentration of 12 μg/ml. From FACS analysis， we observed an apoptotic cell death of 44.4% at BRM270 NPs treated cells while only 12.5% found in the free BRM270 treated cells. Further， the comparative relative expression profiling of the candidate genes were showed significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of IL6， BCL2， p53， and MMP9 in the BRM270 NPs treated cells， compared to the free BRM270 and doxorubicin. Indeed， the genes， CASPASE 9 and BAX have shown significant (p < 0.05) upregulation in cells treated with BRM270 NPs as compared to counter treatment groups. The investigation of the signal pathways and protein-protein network associations were also carried out to elucidate the functional insights underlying anti-cancer potential of BRM270 NPs in HepG2 cells. Taken together， our findings demonstrated that these uniquely engineered BRM270 NPs effectively enter into the cancer cells due to its acidic microenvironment thereby inducing apoptosis and regulate the cell-proliferation in-vitro at extremely low dosages.Keywords:Anticancer activity; BRM270 nanoparticles; Human hepatoma cancer cells; Mechanical-milling method; Phyto-composite.
Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition is required to effectively impair microenvironment survival signals in mantle cell lymphoma.,Oncotarget, 2014 Aug 30,25216518,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25216518/,Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation contributes to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) pathogenesis and drug resistance. Antitumor activity has been observed with mTOR inhibitors. However， they have shown limited clinical efficacy in relation to drug activation of feedback loops. Selective PI3K inhibition or dual PI3K/mTOR catalytic inhibition are different therapeutic approaches developed to achieve effective pathway blockage. Here， we have performed a comparative analysis of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus， the pan-PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 in primary MCL cells. We found NVP-BEZ235 to be more powerful than everolimus or NVP-BKM120 in PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibition， indicating that targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at multiple levels is likely to be a more effective strategy for the treatment of MCL than single inhibition of these kinases. Among the three drugs， NVP-BEZ235 induced the highest change in gene expression profile. Functional validation demonstrated that NVP-BEZ235 inhibited angiogenesis， migration and tumor invasiveness in MCL cells. NVP-BEZ235 was the only drug able to block IL4 and IL6/STAT3 signaling which compromise the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in MCL. Our findings support the use of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 as a promising approach to interfere with the microenvironment-related processes in MCL.
A High-throughput Quantitative Expression Analysis of Cancer-related Genes in Human HepG2 Cells in Response to Limonene， a Potential Anticancer Agent.,Curr Cancer Drug Targets, 2018,29141549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29141549/,Background:Citrus bioactive compounds， as active anticancer agents， have been under focus by several studies worldwide. However， the underlying genes responsible for the anticancer potential have not been sufficiently highlighted.Objectives:The current study investigated the gene expression profile of hepatocellular carcinoma， HepG2， cells after treatment with Limonene.Methods:The concentration that killed 50% of HepG2 cells was used to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of limonene anticancer activity. The apoptotic induction was detected by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscope. Two of the pro-apoptotic events， caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine translocation were manifested by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Highthroughput real-time PCR was used to profile 1023 cancer-related genes in 16 different gene families related to the cancer development.Results:In comparison to untreated cells， limonene increased the percentage of apoptotic cells up to 89.61%， by flow cytometry， and 48.2% by fluorescence microscopy. There was a significant limonene- driven differential gene expression of HepG2 cells in 15 different gene families. Limonene was shown to significantly (>2log) up-regulate and down-regulate 14 and 59 genes， respectively. The affected gene families， from the most to the least affected， were apoptosis induction， signal transduction， cancer genes augmentation， alteration in kinases expression， inflammation， DNA damage repair， and cell cycle proteins.Conclusion:The current study reveals that limonene could be a promising， cheap， and effective anticancer compound. The broad spectrum of limonene anticancer activity is interesting for anticancer drug development. Further research is needed to confirm the current findings and to examine the anticancer potential of limonene along with underlying mechanisms on different cell lines.Keywords:Anticancer; HepG2; cancer-related genes; flavonoids; high-throughput PCR; limonene; tumor suppressor..
Actin remodeling confers BRAF inhibitor resistance to melanoma cells through YAP/TAZ activation.,EMBO J, 2016 Mar 1,26668268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26668268/,The activation of transcriptional coactivators YAP and its paralog TAZ has been shown to promote resistance to anti-cancer therapies. YAP/TAZ activity is tightly coupled to actin cytoskeleton architecture. However， the influence of actin remodeling on cancer drug resistance remains largely unexplored. Here， we report a pivotal role of actin remodeling in YAP/TAZ-dependent BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells. Melanoma cells resistant to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 exhibit an increase in actin stress fiber formation， which appears to promote the nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ. Knockdown of YAP/TAZ reduces the viability of resistant melanoma cells， whereas overexpression of constitutively active YAP induces resistance. Moreover， inhibition of actin polymerization and actomyosin tension in melanoma cells suppresses both YAP/TAZ activation and PLX4032 resistance. Our siRNA library screening identifies actin dynamics regulator TESK1 as a novel vulnerable point of the YAP/TAZ-dependent resistance pathway. These results suggest that inhibition of actin remodeling is a potential strategy to suppress resistance in BRAF inhibitor therapies.Keywords:BRAF inhibitor resistance; TAZ; YAP; actin cytoskeleton; melanoma.
The role of ESCO2， SALL4 and TBX5 genes in the susceptibility to thalidomide teratogenesis.,Sci Rep, 2019 Aug 6,31388035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31388035/,Thalidomide is widely used for several diseases; however， it causes malformations in embryos exposed during pregnancy. The complete understanding of the mechanisms by which thalidomide affects the embryo development has not yet been obtained. The phenotypic similarity makes TE a phenocopy of syndromes caused by mutations in ESCO2， SALL4 and TBX5 genes. Recently， SALL4 and TBX5 were demonstrated to be thalidomide targets. To understand if these genes act in the TE development， we sequenced them in 27 individuals with TE; we verified how thalidomide affect them in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis from GSE63935; and we evaluated how these genes are functionally related through an interaction network analysis. We identified 8 variants in ESCO2， 15 in SALL4 and 15 in TBX5. We compared allelic frequencies with data from ExAC， 1000 Genomes and ABraOM databases; eight variants were significantly different (p < 0.05). Eleven variants in SALL4 and TBX5 were previously associated with cardiac diseases or malformations; however， in TE sample there was no association. Variant effect prediction tools showed 97% of the variants with potential to influence in these genes regulation. DGE analysis showed a significant reduction of ESCO2 in hPSCs after thalidomide exposure.
Epigenetic therapy restores normal hematopoiesis in a zebrafish model of NUP98-HOXA9-induced myeloid disease.,Leukemia, 2015 Oct,26017032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26017032/,ute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs when multiple genetic aberrations alter white blood cell development， leading to hyperproliferation and arrest of cell differentiation. Pertinent animal models link in vitro studies with the use of new agents in clinical trials. We generated a transgenic zebrafish expressing human NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9)， a fusion oncogene found in high-risk AML. Embryos developed a preleukemic state with anemia and myeloid cell expansion， and adult fish developed a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). We leveraged this model to show that NHA9 increases the number of hematopoietic stem cells， and that oncogenic function of NHA9 depends on downstream activation of meis1， the PTGS/COX pathway and genome hypermethylation through the DNA methyltransferase， dnmt1. We restored normal hematopoiesis in NHA9 embryos with knockdown of meis1 or dnmt1， as well as pharmacologic treatment with DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors or cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors. DNMT inhibitors reduced genome methylation to near normal levels. Strikingly， we discovered synergy when we combined sub-monotherapeutic doses of a histone deacetylase inhibitor plus either a DNMT inhibitor or COX inhibitor to block the effects of NHA9 on zebrafish blood development. Our work proposes novel drug targets in NHA9-induced myeloid disease， and suggests rational therapies by combining minimal doses of known bioactive compounds.
Early aldosterone up-regulated genes: new pathways for renal disease?,Kidney Int, 2003 Oct,12969137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12969137/,Background:The use of aldosterone antagonists has important beneficial effects on the progression of renal and cardiac disease reflected in a decrease of cardiovascular mortality and renal failure. Nevertheless， the incidence of heart and end-stage renal failure continues to increase. This leads to the conclusion that mechanisms independent of the classical aldosterone/mineralocorticoid receptor system may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac and renal disease.Methods:The mRNA expression profile of human renal epithelial cells in response to aldosterone was characterized using cDNA arrays covering approximately 1430 genes. Differentially expressed genes were further evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)， Northern blotting， and estimating the gene products by Western blotting.Results:Aldosterone treatment of cells resulted in significant up-regulation of several genes within 1 hour， with sgk， p21/waf1， gadd45， and gadd153 being the most significant ones. Long-term treatment (>4 hours) with aldosterone induced the mRNA expression of pparalpha and puralpha. The mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitor spironolactone decreased the mRNA levels of sgk， p21/waf1， and gadd45， whereas the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor RU 486 reduced the mRNA level of sgk and p21/waf1. Gadd153 was not affected by any of the inhibitors， probably indicating regulation by nonclassic mechanisms.Conclusion:Among the early genes investigated in this study， one transcript has been identified that is not suppressed by antagonists of either glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptor. Further studies should be able to identify other genes regulated in a similar manner that could explain the inefficacy of spironolactone in some cases of aldosterone-mediated kidney disease.
A Stromal Immune Module Correlated with the Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy， Prognosis and Lymphocyte Infiltration in HER2-Positive Breast Carcinoma Is Inversely Correlated with Hormonal Pathways.,PLoS One, 2016 Dec 22,28005906,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28005906/,"Introduction:HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous group of aggressive breast cancers， the prognosis of which has greatly improved since the introduction of treatments targeting HER2. However， these tumors may display intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment， and classifiers of HER2-positive tumors are required to improve the prediction of prognosis and to develop novel therapeutic interventions.Methods:We analyzed 2893 primary human breast cancer samples from 21 publicly available datasets and developed a six-metagene signature on a training set of 448 HER2-positive BC. We then used external public datasets to assess the ability of these metagenes to predict the response to chemotherapy (Ignatiadis dataset)， and prognosis (METABRIC dataset).Results:We identified a six-metagene signature (138 genes) containing metagenes enriched in different gene ontologies. The gene clusters were named as follows: Immunity， Tumor suppressors/proliferation， Interferon， Signal transduction， Hormone/survival and Matrix clusters. In all datasets， the Immunity metagene was less strongly expressed in ER-positive than in ER-negative tumors， and was inversely correlated with the Hormonal/survival metagene. Within the signature， multivariate analyses showed that strong expression of the ""Immunity"" metagene was associated with higher pCR rates after NAC (OR = 3.71[1.28-11.91]， p = 0.019) than weak expression， and with a better prognosis in HER2-positive/ER-negative breast cancers (HR = 0.58 [0.36-0.94]， p = 0.026). Immunity metagene expression was associated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).Conclusion:The identification of a predictive and prognostic immune module in HER2-positive BC confirms the need for clinical testing for immune checkpoint modulators and vaccines for this specific subtype. The inverse correlation between Immunity and hormone pathways opens research perspectives and deserves further investigation."
Petite Integration Factor 1 knockdown enhances gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cells via increasing DNA damage.,J Appl Toxicol, 2023 Oct,37183367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37183367/,Chemoresistance is still a vital obstacle in various tumors chemotherapy. This study aimed to explore the role of Petite Integration Factor 1 (PIF1) in the sensitivity of gemcitabine response to pancreatic cancer cells. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database was employed for evaluating the level of PIF1 in pancreatic cancer tissues and normal tissues. The mRNA level of PIF1 was detected via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The relative protein expression of PIF1， cleaved caspase-3， and phosphorylated histone H2Ax (γH2Ax) was assessed through western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry， respectively. Moreover， lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and caspase-3 activity were determined via the corresponding LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit and caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit. PIF1 expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of PIF1 exhibited the repressive impact on the viability of AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells. PIF1 knockdown enhanced LDH release and apoptosis in both AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells. PIF1 downregulation could augment the sensitivity of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells， as evidenced by lower cell viability and higher LDH release and apoptosis rate after knocking down PIF1 in gemcitabine-treated pancreatic cancer cells relative to pancreatic cancer cells treated with gemcitabine alone. Moreover， PIF1 knockdown increased γH2Ax protein expression and DNA damage， and gemcitabine treatment-induced DNA damage in AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells was exacerbated by PIF1 silencing. Furthermore， gemcitabine treatment-caused increase of DNA damage was alleviated by PIF1 overexpression; whereas， this effect of PIF1 upregulation was reversed by thymidine， a DNA synthesis inhibitor. In addition， the decreased gemcitabine sensitivity response to pancreatic cancer cells caused by PIF1 upregulation was also hindered by thymidine treatment. In conclusion， PIF1 silencing enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity response to pancreatic cancer cells through aggrandizing DNA damage.Keywords:DNA damage; PIF1; cell apoptosis; gemcitabine; pancreatic cancer.
Integrated Analysis of mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq to Identify c-MYC， YAP1 and miR-3960 as Major Players in the Anticancer Effects of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester in Human Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Line.,Curr Gene Ther, 2020,32445454,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32445454/,Background:Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE)， an active extract of propolis， has recently been reported to have broad applications in various cancers. However， the effects of CAPE on Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) are largely unknown. Therefore， the aim of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative effect of CAPE and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms in SCLC cells using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.Methods:Small-cell lung cancer H446 cells were treated with CAPE， and cell proliferation and apoptosis were then assessed. Additionally， the regulation mediated by miR-3960 after CAPE treatment was explored and the altered signaling pathways were predicted in a bioinformatics analysis.Results:CAPE significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. CAPE decreased the expression of Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1) and cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-MYC) protein. Moreover， the upregulation of miR-3960 by CAPE contributed to CAPE-induced apoptosis. The knockdown of miR-3960 decreased the CAPE-induced apoptosis.Conclusion:We demonstrated the anti-cancer effect of CAPE in human SCLC cells and studied the mechanism by acquiring a comprehensive transcriptome profile of CAPE-treated cells.Keywords:Caffeic acid phenethyl ester; YAP1; c-MYC; high-throughput sequencing; miR-3960; small cell lung cancer..
Limited role of N-terminal phosphoserine residues in the activation of transcription by p53.,Oncogene, 2004 May 27,15064747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15064747/,The p53 tumor suppressor is phosphorylated in response to various cellular stress signals， such as DNA damage， leading to its release from MDM2 and consequent stabilization and activation as a transcription factor. In human U2OS cells， treatment with adriamycin causes p53 to be phosphorylated on all six serine residues tested， leading to the dissociation of p53 from MDM2 and transcription of the p21 and mdm2 genes. In contrast， in these cells， IPTG-dependent induction of p14ARF， which sequesters MDM2 away from p53， does not lead to detectable phosphorylation of any of the five N-terminal serine residues tested (6， 9， 15， 20， 37). Only C-terminal serine 392 is phosphorylated. However， the increase of p21 and mdm2 mRNAs was indistinguishable following treatment with adriamycin or induction of p14ARF. By using cDNA arrays to examine global p53-dependent gene expression in response to adriamycin or p14ARF， we found that most genes were regulated similarly by the two treatments. However， a subset of p53-regulated genes whose products have proliferative roles or regulate VEGF activity， newly described here， are repressed by p14ARF much more than by adriamycin. We conclude that the phosphorylation of p53 on N-terminal serine residues is not required for increased transcription of the great majority of p53-responsive genes and that the induction of p53 by p14ARF， with little phosphorylation， leads to substantial repression of genes whose products have roles in proliferation.
MicroRNA-155 induction via TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma suppresses expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in human primary cells.,J Biol Chem, 2017 Dec 15,29066622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29066622/,Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a critical regulator of T cell function contributing to peripheral immune tolerance. Although it has been shown that posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms control PD-L1 expression in cancer， it remains unknown whether such regulatory loops operate also in non-transformed cells. Here we studied PD-L1 expression in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs)， which play key roles in immunity and cancer. Treatment of HDLECs with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α synergistically up-regulated PD-L1 expression. IFN-γ and TNF-α also affected expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs) that have the potential to suppress PD-L1 expression. The most highly up-regulated miRNA following IFN-γ and TNF-α treatment in HDLECs was miR-155， which has a central role in the immune system and cancer. Induction of miR-155 was driven by TNF-α， the effect of which was significantly enhanced by IFN-γ. The PD-L1 3'-UTR contains two functional miR-155-binding sites. Endogenous miR-155 controlled the kinetics and maximal levels of PD-L1 induction upon IFN-γ and TNF-α treatments. We obtained similar findings in dermal fibroblasts， demonstrating that the IFN-γ/TNF-α/miR-155/PD-L1 pathway is not restricted to HDLECs. These results reveal miR-155 as a critical component of an inflammation-induced regulatory loop controlling PD-L1 expression in primary cells.Keywords:PD-L1; endothelial cell; fibroblast; immune checkpoint inhibitors; inflammation; interferon; lymphatic endothelial cells; miR-155; microRNA (miRNA).
Using gene expression database to uncover biology functions of 1，4-disubstituted 1，2，3-triazole analogues synthesized via a copper (I)-catalyzed reaction.,Eur J Med Chem, 2017 May 26,28342400,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28342400/,We have synthesized bioactive 1，4-disubstituted 1，2，3-triazole analogues containing 2H-1，4-benzoxazin-3-(4H)-one derivatives via 1，3-dipolar cycloaddition in the presence of CuI. All the reactions proceeded smoothly and afforded its desired products in excellent yields. Among these analogues， 3y exhibited a better cytotoxic effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep 3B cells and displayed less cytotoxicity on normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells， compared with Sorafenib， a targeted therapy for advanced HCC. 3y also induced stronger apoptosis and autophagy. Addition of curcumin enhanced 3y-induced cytotoxicity by further induction of autophagy. Using gene expression signatures of 3y to query Connectivity Map， a glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor (AR-A014418) was predicted to display similar molecular action of 3y. Experiments further demonstrate that AR-A014418 acted like 3y， and vice versa. Overall， our data suggest the chemotherapeutic potential of 3y on HCC.Keywords:1，4-Disubstituted 1，2，3-triazole analogues; Apoptosis; Autophagy; Connectivity map; L1000 gene expression profiling; Sorafenib.
Strategies for clinical trials in type 1 diabetes.,J Autoimmun, 2016 Jul,27068279,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27068279/,During the past one to two decades， substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the immunopathology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the potential for immune interventions that can alter the natural history of the disease. This progress has resulted from the use of standardized study designs， endpoints， and， to a certain extent， mechanistic analyses in intervention trials in the setting of new-onset T1D. To date， most of these trials have involved single-agent interventions but， increasingly， future trials will test therapeutic combinations that are based on a compelling scientific rationale and testable mechanistic hypotheses. These increasingly complex trials will benefit from novel trial designs (such as factorial or adaptive designs)， enhanced clinical endpoints that more directly assess islet pathology (such as β-cell death assays and islet or pancreatic imaging)， improved responder analyses， and sophisticated mechanistic assays that provide deep phenotyping of lymphocyte subsets， gene expression profiling， in vitro T cell functional assessments， and antigen-specific responses. With this developing armamentarium of enhanced trial designs， endpoints， and clinical and mechanistic response analyses， we can expect substantial progress in better understanding the breakdown in immunologic tolerance in T1D and how to restore it to achieve significant and long-lasting preservation of islet function.Keywords:Adaptive trials; Combination therapies; Immune tolerance network; New-onset T1D; Responder analysis; β cell.
Function of DNA methyltransferase 3a in lead (Pb(2+) )-Induced Cyclooxygenase-2 gene.,Environ Toxicol, 2015 Sep,24639330,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24639330/,Lead ions (Pb(2+) ) are toxic industrial pollutants associated with chronic inflammatory diseases in humans and animals. Previously， we found that Pb(2+) ions induce COX-2 gene expression via the EGF receptor/nuclear factor-κB signal transduction pathway in epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. In this study， to see whether Pb(2+) ions affect COX-2 expression by epigenetic mechanisms， we looked at the mRNAs of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) using real-time PCR of total RNA from these cells. Cells exposed to Pb(2+) had low levels of DNMT3a mRNA， whereas the levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3b mRNAs remained unchanged. Pretreatment of cells with DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5 μM) followed by Pb(2+) (1 μM) significantly increased levels of COX-2 mRNA compared with cells treated with Pb(2+) alone. Overexpression of tumor suppressor gene Rb correlated with an increase in COX-2 mRNA and a decrease in DNMT3a mRNA. Conversely， overexpression of transcription factor E2F1 correlated with a decrease in COX-2 mRNA and an increase in DMNT3a mRNA. Pretreatment with EGFR inhibitors AG1478 and PD153035 significantly limited Pb(2+) -induced reduction in DNMT3a mRNA. In addition， gene knockdown of DNMT3a with short hairpin RNA correlated with increased COX-2 mRNA induced by Pb(2+) . Our findings suggest Pb(2+) ions induce COX-2 expression indirectly by reducing DNMT3a methylation of the COX-2 promoter via transcription factors Rb and E2F1.Keywords:DNA methyltransferase 3a; cyclooxygenase-2; epidermal growth factor receptor; lead.
Network pharmacology and experimental verification study on the mechanism of Hedyotis diffusa Willd in treating colorectal cancer.,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol, 2024 Sep,38446216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38446216/,This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological mechanism of Hedyotis diffusa Willd against CRC (colorectal cancer) using network pharmacological analysis combined with experimental validation. The active components and potential targets of Hedyotis diffusa Willd were screened from the tax compliance management program public database using network pharmacology. The core anti-CRC targets were screened using a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The mRNA and protein expression of core target genes in normal colon and CRC tissues and their relationship with overall CRC survival were evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)， Human Protein Atlas (HPA)， and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of the potential targets were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The first six core targets with stable binding were molecular-docked with the active components quercetin and β-sitosterol. Finally， the results of network pharmacology were verified using in vitro experiments. In total， 149 potential targets were identified by searching for seven types of active components and the intersection of all potential and CRC targets. PPI network analysis showed that ten target genes， including tumor protein p53 (TP53) and recombinant cyclin D1 (CCND1)， were pivotal genes. GO enrichment analysis involved 2043 biological processes， 52 cellular components， and 191 molecular functions. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the anticancer effects of H. alba were mediated by tumor necrosis factor， interleukin-17， and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Validation of key targets showed that the validation results for most core genes were consistent with those in this study. Molecular docking revealed that the ten core target proteins could be well combined with quercetin and β-sitosterol and the structure remained stable after binding. The results of the in vitro experiment showed that β-sitosterol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in SW620 cells. This study identified a potential target plant for CRC through network pharmacology and in vitro validation.Keywords:Colorectal cancer; Experimental verification; Hedyotis diffusa Willd; Molecular docking; Network pharmacology.
Induction of Apoptosis in Endometrial Cancer (Ishikawa) Cells by Pogostemon cablin Aqueous Extract (PCAE).,Int J Mol Sci, 2015 Jun 2,26042464,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26042464/,Pogostemon cablin (PC) is a traditional herbal medicine used in the treatment of the common cold， nausea， diarrhea， and even for headaches and fever. However， the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative activity of PC in endometrial cancer (EC) cells have yet to be fully elucidated. This study investigated the anticancer effects of an aqueous extract of Pogostemon cablin (PCAE)， specifically induced apoptosis in EC (Ishikawa) cells. Proliferation of EC cells following exposure to PCAE was assessed by an MTT assay. DNA content and the induction of cell cycle apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur). Protein caspase-3 and， -9 as well as AIF were investigated using Western blot. Our results demonstrate growth inhibition of Ishikawa cells by PCAE. Furthermore， caspase-3 activity caused PCAE-treated cell lines to accumulate in apoptosis. Gene expression profiling (GEP) results further suggest that， in addition to its known effects with regard to EC prevention， PCAE may also exert antitumor activity on established EC cells. Many previous studies have identified the chemo-preventive effects of natural plant materials and the potential role of these materials in chemotherapy. This current study used human EC Ishikawa cells to investigate the anti-tumor effects of PCAE in EC cells. Our results demonstrate that PCAE inhibits the growth of cancer cells and induces apoptosis， which suggests the potential applicability of PCAE as an antitumor agent.Keywords:Pogostemon cablin aqueous extract (PCAE); apoptosis; endometrial cancer.
Genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA-seq analyses identify genes and pathways associated with doxorubicin resistance in a canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line.,PLoS One, 2021 May 7,33961622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33961622/,Doxorubicin resistance is a major challenge in the successful treatment of canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (cDLBCL). In the present study， MethylCap-seq and RNA-seq were performed to characterize the genome-wide DNA methylation and differential gene expression patterns respectively in CLBL-1 8.0， a doxorubicin-resistant cDLBCL cell line， and in CLBL-1 as control， to investigate the underlying mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance in cDLBCL. A total of 20289 hypermethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected. Among these， 1339 hypermethylated DMRs were in promoter regions， of which 24 genes showed an inverse correlation between methylation and gene expression. These 24 genes were involved in cell migration， according to gene ontology (GO) analysis. Also， 12855 hypermethylated DMRs were in gene-body regions. Among these， 353 genes showed a positive correlation between methylation and gene expression. Functional analysis of these 353 genes highlighted that TGF-β and lysosome-mediated signal pathways are significantly associated with the drug resistance of CLBL-1. The tumorigenic role of TGF-β signaling pathway in CLBL-1 8.0 was further validated by treating the cells with a TGF-β inhibitor(s) to show the increased chemo-sensitivity and intracellular doxorubicin accumulation， as well as decreased p-glycoprotein expression. In summary， the present study performed an integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression in CLBL-1 8.0 and CLBL-1. The candidate genes and pathways identified in this study hold potential promise for overcoming doxorubicin resistance in cDLBCL.
Interferon response to respiratory syncytial virus by bronchial epithelium from children with asthma is inversely correlated with pulmonary function.,J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2018 Aug,29106997,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29106997/,Background:Respiratory viral infection in early childhood， including that from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)， has been previously associated with the development of asthma.Objective:We aimed to determine whether ex vivo RSV infection of bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) from children with asthma would induce specific gene expression patterns and whether such patterns were associated with lung function among BEC donors.Methods:Primary BECs from carefully characterized children with asthma (n = 18) and matched healthy children without asthma (n = 8) were differentiated at an air-liquid interface for 21 days. Air-liquid interface cultures were infected with RSV for 96 hours and RNA was subsequently isolated from BECs. In each case， we analyzed gene expression using RNA sequencing and assessed differences between conditions by linear modeling of the data. BEC donors completed spirometry to measure lung function.Results:RSV infection of BECs from subjects with asthma， compared with uninfected BECs from subjects with asthma， led to a significant increase in expression of 6199 genes. There was significantly greater expression of 195 genes in BECs from children with asthma and airway obstruction (FEV1/forced vital capacity < 0.85 and FEV1< 100% predicted) than in BECs from children with asthma without obstruction， or in BECs from healthy children. These specific genes were found to be highly enriched for viral response genes induced in parallel with types I and III interferons.Conclusions:BECs from children with asthma and with obstructive physiology exhibit greater expression of types I and III interferons and interferon-stimulated genes than do cells from children with normal lung function， and expression of interferon-associated genes correlates with the degree of airway obstruction. These findings suggest that an exaggerated interferon response to viral infection by airway epithelial cells may be a mechanism leading to lung function decline in a subset of children with asthma.Keywords:Asthma; RNA; epithelial cells; respiratory syncytial virus; sequence analysis; type I interferon.
MAGEA6 positively regulates MSMO1 and promotes the migration and invasion of oesophageal cancer cells.,Exp Ther Med, 2022 Mar,35126707,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35126707/,The melanoma antigen gene family A (MAGEA) family of proteins comprises of cancer-testis antigens that are highly expressed in a number of tumours but are minimally expressed in normal cells. Due to its expression characteristics， this protein family has become a popular target for anti-cancer drugs and immunotherapy research over recent years. Although， elevated expression levels of MAGEA6 has been found in different types of tumours， there remains to be insufficient information on the function of MAGEA6 and its associated gene regulation pathways. The present study used Transwell， Cell Counting Kit-8 and wound healing assays to analyse the effects of MAGEA6 on Eca109 cell invasion， migration and proliferation. The main functions and pathways involved in MAGEA6 were predicted by Illumina Hiseq screening for mutually regulated genes and core genes. Eca109 cell line with a high expression of MAGEA6 was a stable cell line obtained by transfection in the early stage， and this cell line was used in subsequent experiments. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on this cell line and the Eca109 cell line that normally expressed MAGEA6. It was revealed that a high expression of MAGEA6 conferred a significant stimulating effect on cell proliferation whilst also significantly increasing cell invasion and migration. Transcriptomic analysis identified 14 differentially expressed genes and 13 core regulatory genes closely associated with MAGEA6 expression regulation， such as methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (MSMO1). The present study suggest that MAGEA6 positively regulated MSMO1 expression， which may serve an oncogenic role in cells through this regulatory effect. Overall， this provided a novel route of investigation for an in-depth study of the regulatory function of MAGEA6.Keywords:RNA polymerase II; melanoma antigen family A 6; methylsterol monooxygenase 1; oesophageal cancer cells; transcriptome analysis.
Knock down of hSNF5/Ini1 causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2007 Sep 28,17669367,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17669367/,hSNF5/Ini1 is a core component of the SWI/SNF complex and the gene is frequently mutated in aggressive pediatric rhabdoid tumors. Mechanisms of the malignant transformation， however， remain poorly understood. We analyzed HeLa cells treated with siRNA to the hSNF5/Ini1 mRNA. The resulting efficient and long-term suppression caused characteristic cell enlargement， cell cycle arrest in G1 phase， and subsequent modest apoptosis. Gene expression profiling of the hSNF5-down-regulated cells by cDNA microarray analysis revealed that a limited number of p53-responsive genes， especially p21， were up-regulated. The p53 protein level was also greatly enhanced， suggesting that loss of hSNF5/Ini1 induces a p53 signaling pathway irrelevant to the chk1/2 phosphorylation pathway. Some rhabdoid tumors with very low or no ARF expression were induced to undergo cell enlargement， growth arrest， and， in one case， apoptosis by ectopic expression of the p14ARF protein. These results may in part account for molecular mechanisms of rhabdoid tumor formation.
A genomic approach to identify molecular pathways associated with chemotherapy resistance.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2008 Oct,18852117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18852117/,Resistance to chemotherapy in cancer is common. As gene expression profiling has been shown to anticipate chemotherapeutic resistance， we sought to identify cellular pathways associated with resistance to facilitate effective combination therapy. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to associate pathways with resistance in two data sets: the NCI-60 cancer cell lines deemed sensitive and resistant to specific chemotherapeutic agents (Adriamycin， cyclophosphamide， docetaxel， etoposide， 5-fluorouracil， paclitaxel， and topotecan) and a series of 40 lung cancer cell lines for which sensitivity to cisplatin and docetaxel was determined. Candidate pathways were further screened in silico using the Connectivity Map. The lead candidate pathway was functionally validated in vitro. Gene set enrichment analysis associated the matrix metalloproteinase， p53， methionine metabolism， and free pathways with cytotoxic resistance in the NCI-60 cell lines across multiple agents， but no gene set was common to all drugs. Analysis of the lung cancer cell lines identified the bcl-2 pathway to be associated with cisplatin resistance and the AKT pathway enriched in cisplatin- and docetaxel-resistant cell lines. Results from Connectivity Map supported an association between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and docetaxel resistance but did not support the association with cisplatin. Targeted inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway with LY294002， in combination with docetaxel， resulted in a synergistic effect in previously docetaxel-resistant cell lines but not with cisplatin. These results support the use of a genomic approach to identify drug-specific targets associated with the development of chemotherapy resistance and underscore the importance of disease context in identifying these pathways.
Involvement of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/TNF receptor system in leukemic cell apoptosis induced by histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide (FK228).,J Cell Physiol, 2005 May,15515013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15515013/,Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a novel strategy for the treatment of leukemias via restoration of aberrantly silenced genes. In this study， we conducted a detailed analysis of anti-leukemic effects of an HDAC inhibitor (HDI)， depsipeptide (FK228)， using myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K562. DNA chip analysis revealed upregulation of TNF-alpha mRNA and a number of molecules involved in TNF-signaling such as TRAF-6， caspases-10， and -7 in depsipeptide-treated HL-60 cells， which prompted us to examine the involvement of the TNF/TNF receptor system in the anti-leukemic effects of the drug. Upregulation of TNF-alpha was induced by depsipeptide in HL-60 and K562 cells， which expressed type I TNF receptors (TNF-RI). Depsipeptide activated caspases-8 and -10， which in turn cleave caspases-3 and -7， leading to apoptotic cell death in both cell lines. Anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody and short interfering RNA (siRNA) against TNF-RI alleviated the activation of the caspase cascade and the induction of apoptosis， indicating the presence of an autocrine loop. Finally， we demonstrated that the enhanced production of TNF-alpha by depsipeptide was due to transcriptional activation of the TNF-alpha gene through hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in its promoter region (-208 to +35). These results suggest that autocrine production of TNF-alpha plays a role in the cytotoxicity of depsipeptide against a subset of leukemias.
[PRDM1 expression and its relationship with PI3K/AKT pathway activation in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma-nasal type].,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi, 2018 Dec 14,30612403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30612403/,inEnglish，ChineseObjective:To investigate the expression of PRDM1 and its relationship with PI3K/AKT pathway activation in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma-nasal type.Methods:Immunocytochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of PRDM1 and p-AKT in 10 EN-NK/T-NT tissue or 3 cell lines (PRDM1-positive YT cell line， PRDM1-negative NKL and NK92 cell lines). Nanostring gene expression profiling technique was used to detect the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in normal nasal mucosa， PRDM1-negative and positive EN-NK/T-NT tissue. MTS was used to detect cell proliferation， and flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle and apoptosis.Results:Nanostring gene expression profiling revealed that genes associated with PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (eg， IL-7， BRCA1， ITGA8， IL2RB， FASLG， CDK2， COL27A1， CSF3R， KITLG and IL-6) were highly expressed in EN-NK/T-NT cases (P<0.05). Also， we found that p-AKT was highly expressed in YT cell line， but lower or not expressed in NK92 and NKL cells. In addition， LY294002， a PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor， increased PRDM1 and PTEN expression in a dose dependent manner in YT cells. More importantly， YT cell were treated with 20 μmol/L LY294002 48 h， the proliferation rate was significantly decreasing (58.18%vs100.00%，t=12.770，P=0.006)， and the proportion of cells in G(1) phase was significantly increased (30.05%vs76.93%，t=11.570，P<0.001). However， there was no significant difference in cell proliferation and cell cycle between NKL cells and control group (P>0.05).Conclusion:The activation of PI3K/AKT pathway is positive associated with the expression of PRDM1 in EN-NK/T-NT， and inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway may have significant therapeutic potential for PRDM1-positive EN-NK/T-NT.目的：探讨抑癌基因PRDM1在结外NK/T细胞淋巴瘤-鼻型（EN-NK/T-NT）中的表达及其与PI3K/AKT通路活化的关系。方法：以10例EN-NK/T-NT患者病理组织标本和PRDM1阳性细胞系YT细胞、PRDM1缺失细胞系NKL、NK92细胞为研究对象，采用免疫细胞化学和Western blot法检测PRDM1、p-AKT的表达，采用NanoString基因表达谱技术检测PI3K/AKT通路在正常鼻黏膜、PRDM1阴性和阳性EN-NK/T-NT组织中的激活情况，采用MTS法检测YT、NKL和NK92细胞增殖活性，采用流式细胞术检测细胞周期和细胞凋亡。结果：①NanoString基因表达谱分析结果显示PRDM1阳性组PI3K/AKT信号通路IL-7、BRCA1、ITGA8、IL2RB、FASLG、CDK2、COL27A1、CSF3R、KITLG、IL-6的表达明显高于对照组，差异均有统计学意义（P值均<0.05）。②免疫细胞化学和Western blot法检测结果显示p-AKT在YT细胞系中高表达，而在NK92和NKL细胞中低表达或不表达。③Western blot法检测结果显示，PI3K/AKT通路抑制剂LY294002作用24 h后YT细胞PRDM1和PTEN的表达水平升高，且呈剂量依赖性。④LY294002（20 μmol/L）作用48 h后，与对照组比较，YT细胞增殖率较对照组明显降低（100.00%对58.18%，t=－12.770，P=0.006），G(1)期细胞比例明显增高（30.05%对76.93%，t=11.570，P<0.001），差异均有统计学意义；但NKL细胞与对照组比较细胞增殖和细胞周期的差异均无统计学意义（P值均>0.05）。结论：EN-NK/T-NT中PI3K/AKT通路活化与PRDM1阳性表达相关，抑制PI3K/AKT通路有望成为PRDM1阳性EN-NK/T-NT的治疗手段。.Keywords:Genes， PRDM1; Lymphoma， extra-nodal NK-T-cell; Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Protein kinases.
Mycoplasma hyorhinis reduces sensitivity of human lung carcinoma cells to Nutlin-3 and promotes their malignant phenotype.,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol, 2018 Jul,29737431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29737431/,Purpose:MDM2 inhibitors are promising anticancer agents that induce cell cycle arrest and tumor cells death via p53 reactivation. We examined the influence of Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection on sensitivity of human lung carcinoma cells NCI-H292 to MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. In order to unveil possible mechanisms underlying the revealed effect， we investigated gene expression changes and signal transduction networks activated in NCI-H292 cells in response to mycoplasma infection.Methods:Sensitivity of NCI-Н292 cells to Nutlin-3 was estimated by resazurin-based cell viability assay. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles of NCI-H292 and NCI-Н292Myc.hcell lines were determined using Illumina Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip. Search for key transcription factors and key node molecules was performed using the geneXplain platform. Ability for anchorage-independent growth was tested by soft agar colony formation assay.Results:NCI-Н292Myc.hcells were shown to be 1.5- and 5.2-fold more resistant to killing by Nutlin-3 at concentrations of 15 and 30 µM than uninfected NCI-Н292 cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001， respectively). Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of multiple genes involved in cancer progression and metastasis as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover， we have shown experimentally that NCI-Н292Myc.hcells were more capable of growing and dividing without binding to a substrate. The most likely mechanism explaining the observed changes was found to be TLR4- and IL-1b-mediated activation of NF-κB pathway.Conclusions:Our results provide evidence that mycoplasma infection is an important factor modulating the effect of MDM2 inhibitors on cancer cells and is able to induce EMT-related changes.Keywords:Epithelial–mesenchymal transition; Lung cancer; MDM2 inhibitor; Mycoplasma; NF-κB; Nutlin-3.

Transcription factor RUNX3 promotes CD8+ T cell recruitment by CCL3 and CCL20 in lung adenocarcinoma immune microenvironment.,J Cell Biochem, 2020 Jun,31898342,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898342/,Considering the existence of immune-desert in tumor microenvironment， the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma is limited. This study aims to investigate the ability of transcription factors in regulating tumor immune microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma. RNA-seq data were collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The relationships between transcription factors and immune infiltrates were assessed. Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3)-associated immune pathways were investigated by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes， Gene Ontology， and Gene set enrichment analysis. Upregulated chemokines in the RUNX3-overexpressed cell line were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction， western blot， and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These chemokines were further confirmed in RUNX3-downregulated cell lines. Immunochemistry was conducted to determine the expression of RUNX3， CCL3， CCL20， and the numbers of CD8+T lymphocytes in human lung cancer tissues. Chemokine receptors in CD8+T cells were explored by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. T cell recruitment was investigated by transwell assay. After screening 406 transcription factors， RUNX3 was found strongly correlated T cells， cytotoxic lymphocytes， and CD8+T cells. RUNX3 was associated with a variety of immunomodulators， including LAG3， CTLA-4， PD-1， and TIGIT. More importantly， RUNX3 was involved in immune-related pathways， especially immune cell migration-related pathways. Further investigation exhibited RUNX3 could upregulate CCL3 and CCL20 whose receptors CCR5 and CCR6 were upregulated in CD8+effector T cells， while downregulation of RUNX3 decreased the expression of CCL3 and CCL20 and the infiltration of CD8+T cells in RUNX3-downregulated lung cancer cell lines. Immunochemistry exhibited positive correlations of RUNX3 with CCL3 and CD8+T cells in clinical lung adenocarcinoma samples. The chemotaxis assay proved RUNX3 could promote CD8+T cell recruitment by upregulating CCL3 and CCL20. This study unearths RUNX3 related molecular mechanisms of tumor immune microenvironment and may reverse the immune-desert condition in lung adenocarcinoma and be combined with immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell therapy.Keywords:RUNX3; T cell recruitment; chemokine; lung adenocarcinoma.

PRC2 is recurrently inactivated through EED or SUZ12 loss in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.,Nat Genet, 2014 Nov,25240281,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240281/,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent a group of highly aggressive soft-tissue sarcomas that may occur sporadically， in association with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1 associated) or after radiotherapy. Using comprehensive genomic approaches， we identified loss-of-function somatic alterations of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components (EED or SUZ12) in 92% of sporadic， 70% of NF1-associated and 90% of radiotherapy-associated MPNSTs. MPNSTs with PRC2 loss showed complete loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and aberrant transcriptional activation of multiple PRC2-repressed homeobox master regulators and their regulated developmental pathways. Introduction of the lost PRC2 component in a PRC2-deficient MPNST cell line restored H3K27me3 levels and decreased cell growth. Additionally， we identified frequent somatic alterations of CDKN2A (81% of all MPNSTs) and NF1 (72% of non-NF1-associated MPNSTs)， both of which significantly co-occur with PRC2 alterations. The highly recurrent and specific inactivation of PRC2 components， NF1 and CDKN2A highlights their critical and potentially cooperative roles in MPNST pathogenesis.

Early spatiotemporal-specific changes in intermediate signals are predictive of cytotoxic sensitivity to TNFα and co-treatments.,Sci Rep, 2017 Mar 8,28272488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28272488/,Signaling pathways can generate different cellular responses to the same cytotoxic agents. Current quantitative models for predicting these differential responses are usually based on large numbers of intracellular gene products or signals at different levels of signaling cascades. Here， we report a study to predict cellular sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) using high-throughput cellular imaging and machine-learning methods. We measured and compared 1170 protein phosphorylation events in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines based on different signals， subcellular regions， and time points within one hour of TNFα treatment. We found that two spatiotemporal-specific changes in an intermediate signaling protein， p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)， are sufficient to predict the TNFα sensitivity of these cell lines. Our models could also predict the combined effects of TNFα and other kinase inhibitors， many of which are not known to target RSK directly. Therefore， early spatiotemporal-specific changes in intermediate signals are sufficient to represent the complex cellular responses to these perturbations. Our study provides a general framework for the development of rapid， signaling-based cytotoxicity screens that may be used to predict cellular sensitivity to a cytotoxic agent， or identify co-treatments that may sensitize or desensitize cells to the agent.

Effects of dipotassium-trioxohydroxytetrafluorotriborate， K2[B3O3F4OH]， on cell viability and gene expression of common human cancer drug targets in a melanoma cell line.,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem, 2016 Dec,26307919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26307919/,Recently it was found that dipotassium-trioxohydroxytetrafluorotriborate， K2(B3O3F4OH)， is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of precancerous cell processes. We conducted gene expression profiling of human melanoma cells before and after treatment with two concentrations (0.1 and 1 mM) of this boron inorganic derivative in order to assess its effects on deregulation of genes associated with tumor pathways. Parallel trypan blue exclusion assay was performed to assess the cytotoxicity effects of this chemical. Treatment with K2(B3O3F4OH) induced a significant decrease of cell viability in melanoma cellline at both tested concentrations. Furthermore， these treatments caused deregulation of more than 30 genes known as common anti-tumor drug targets. IGF-1 and hTERT were found to be significantly downregulated and this result may imply potential use of K2(B3O3F4OH) as an inhibitor or human telomerase and insulin-like growth factor 1， both of which are associated with various tumor pathways.Keywords:Antitumor drug target; dipotassium-trioxohydroxytetrafluorotriborate; gene down-regulation; gene expression; human melanoma cell line; human telomerase; insulin-like growth factor 1.
Targeting of PIM Kinases Shows Single Agent Efficacy and Synergizes With BCL2 Inhibitors in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma of the ABC Subtype.,Hematol Oncol, 2025 Mar,40040616,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40040616/,The PIM family of serine/threonine kinases (PIM1， PIM2， and PIM3) are involved in the development of cancer and represent promising therapeutic targets. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting PIM kinases in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)， particularly the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype， using the pan-PIM inhibitor AZD1208. We demonstrated that PIM1 and PIM2 are more highly expressed in ABC- cells than in germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) -DLBCL cells， and that ABC-DLBCL cell lines are more sensitive to PIM inhibition with AZD1208. Transcriptome analysis of ABC-DLBCL cell lines treated with AZD1208 revealed a downregulation of genes involved in NF-κB signaling， a crucial pathway for ABC-DLBCL. We also explored synergistic drug combinations using a high-throughput screen， which identified BCL2 and glutaminase inhibitors as effective partners for AZD1208， particularly in aggressive ABC-DLBCL and double-hit cell lines. The combination of AZD1208 with the clinically available BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax was synergistic in most DLBCL cell lines， and this combination induced apoptosis and reduced levels of AKT and MCL1 proteins. In conclusion， our findings suggested that AZD1208， especially when combined with BCL2 inhibitors like venetoclax， holds promise as a treatment strategy for aggressive lymphomas. These combinations may enable lower doses of PIM inhibitors， leading to increased tolerability and improved anti-tumor activity in clinical settings. The study also highlighted the potential for targeting PIM kinases in combination with other therapies to overcome drug resistance in DLBCL.Keywords:bcl2; dlbcl; lymphoma; pim.
Genome-wide characterization of transcriptional patterns in high and low antibody responders to rubella vaccination.,PLoS One, 2013 May 1,23658707,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23658707/,Immune responses to current rubella vaccines demonstrate significant inter-individual variability. We performed mRNA-Seq profiling on PBMCs from high and low antibody responders to rubella vaccination to delineate transcriptional differences upon viral stimulation. Generalized linear models were used to assess the per gene fold change (FC) for stimulated versus unstimulated samples or the interaction between outcome and stimulation. Model results were evaluated by both FC and p-value. Pathway analysis and self-contained gene set tests were performed for assessment of gene group effects. Of 17，566 detected genes， we identified 1，080 highly significant differentially expressed genes upon viral stimulation (p<1.00E(-15)， FDR<1.00E(-14))， including various immune function and inflammation-related genes， genes involved in cell signaling， cell regulation and transcription， and genes with unknown function. Analysis by immune outcome and stimulation status identified 27 genes (p≤0.0006 and FDR≤0.30) that responded differently to viral stimulation in high vs. low antibody responders， including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (HLA-A， HLA-B and B2M with p = 0.0001， p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0002， respectively)， and two genes related to innate immunity and inflammation (EMR3 and MEFV with p = 1.46E(-08) and p = 0.0004， respectively). Pathway and gene set analysis also revealed transcriptional differences in antigen presentation and innate/inflammatory gene sets and pathways between high and low responders. Using mRNA-Seq genome-wide transcriptional profiling， we identified antigen presentation and innate/inflammatory genes that may assist in explaining rubella vaccine-induced immune response variations. Such information may provide new scientific insights into vaccine-induced immunity useful in rational vaccine development and immune response monitoring.
Raloxifene-induced myeloma cell apoptosis: a study of nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition and gene expression signature.,Mol Pharmacol, 2006 May,16497877,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16497877/,Because multiple myeloma remains associated with a poor prognosis， novel drugs targeting specific signaling pathways are needed. The efficacy of selective estrogen receptor modulators for the treatment of multiple myeloma is not well documented. In the present report， we studied the antitumor activity of raloxifene， a selective estrogen receptor modulator， on multiple myeloma cell lines. Raloxifene effects were assessed by tetrazolium salt reduction assay， cell cycle analysis， and Western blotting. Mobility shift assay， immunoprecipitation， chromatin immunoprecipitation assay， and gene expression profiling were performed to characterize the mechanisms of raloxifene-induced activity. Indeed， raloxifene， as well as tamoxifen， decreased JJN-3 and U266 myeloma cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Raloxifene and tamoxifen also increased the cytotoxic response to vincristine and arsenic trioxide. Moreover， raloxifene inhibited constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in myeloma cells by removing p65 from its binding sites through estrogen receptor alpha interaction with p65. It is noteworthy that microarray analysis showed that raloxifene treatment decreased the expression of known NF-kappaB-regulated genes involved in myeloma cell survival and myeloma-induced bone lesions (e.g.， c-myc， mip-1alpha， hgf， pac1，...) and induced the expression of a subset of genes regulating cellular cycle (e.g.， p21， gadd34， cyclin G2，...). In conclusion， raloxifene induces myeloma cell cycle arrest and apoptosis partly through NF-kappaB-dependent mechanisms. These findings also provide a transcriptional profile of raloxifene treatment on multiple myeloma cells， offering the framework for future studies of selective estrogen receptor modulators therapy in multiple myeloma.
Transcriptional profiling of NCI/ADR-RES cells unveils a complex network of signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of drug resistance.,Onco Targets Ther, 2018 Jan 4,29379303,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29379303/,Background:Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among all the gynecological cancers. This is mostly due to the resistance of ovarian cancer to current chemotherapy regimens. Therefore， it is of crucial importance to identify the molecular mechanisms associated with chemoresistance.Methods:NCI/ADR-RES is a multidrug-resistant cell line that is a model for the study of drug resistance in ovarian cancer. We carried out a microarray-derived transcriptional profiling analysis of NCI/ADR-RES to identify differentially expressed genes relative to its parental OVCAR-8.Results:Gene-expression profiling has allowed the identification of genes and pathways that may be important for the development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer. The NCI/ADR-RES cell line has differential expression of genes involved in drug extrusion， inactivation， and efficacy， as well as genes involved in the architectural and functional reorganization of the extracellular matrix. These genes are controlled through different signaling pathways， including MAPK-Akt， Wnt， and Notch.Conclusion:Our findings highlight the importance of using orthogonal therapies that target completely independent pathways to overcome mechanisms of resistance to both classical chemotherapeutic agents and molecularly targeted drugs.Keywords:drug extrusion; drug inactivation; microarray analysis; multidrug resistance; ovarian cancer.
Nucleolar and Spindle Associated Protein 1 (NUSAP1) Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Enhances Susceptibility to Epirubicin In Invasive Breast Cancer Cells by Regulating Cyclin D Kinase (CDK1) and DLGAP5 Expression.,Med Sci Monit, 2018 Nov 26,30476929,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30476929/,BACKGROUND Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of IBC were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) chip data: GSE21422 and GSE21974. Network analysis of the DEGs and IBC-related genes was performed in STRING database to find the core gene. Thus， this study aimed to determine the role of NUSAP1 in invasive breast cancer (IBC) and to investigate its effect on drug susceptibility to epirubicin (E-ADM). MATERIAL AND METHODS The mRNA expression of NUSAP1 was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). The protein expression was detected by Western blotting. Cell growth and growth cycle were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometry， respectively. Cell migration and invasion were tested by Transwell assay. RESULTS Through use of gene network analysis， we found that NUSAP1 interacts with IBC-related genes. NUSAP1 presented high expression in IBC tissue samples and MCF-7 cells. NUSAP1 overexpression promoted the growth， migration， and invasion of MCF-7 cells. While NUSAP1 gene silencing downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression in G2/M phase， cyclin D kinase (CDK1) and DLGAP5 arrested cells in G2/M phase and significantly inhibited the growth， migration， and invasion of MCF-7 cells. si-NUSAP1 increased the susceptibility of MCF-7 cells to E-ADM-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides evidence that downregulation of NUSAP1 can inhibit the proliferation， migration， and invasion of IBC cells by regulating CDK1 and DLGAP5 expression and enhances the drug susceptibility to E-ADM.
Baicalein， a Natural Anti-Cancer Compound， Alters MicroRNA Expression Profiles in Bel-7402 Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.,Cell Physiol Biochem, 2017,28351032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28351032/,Background/aims:Baicalein has been shown to possess significant anti-hepatoma activity by inhibiting cell proliferation. Whether the anti-proliferative effect of baicalein is related to its modulation of miRNA expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown.Methods:The anti-proliferative effects of baicalein on HCC cell line Bel-7402 was assessed by detecting the proliferation activity， cell cycle distribution， expression changes of p21/CDKN1A， P27/CDKN1B， total Akt and phosphoryted AKT. Microarray analysis was conducted to determine the miRNA expression profiles in baicalein-treated or untreated Bel-7402 cells and then validated by qRT-PCR in two HCC cell lines (Bel-7402 and Hep3B). The gain-of-function of miR-3127-5p was performed by detecting anti-proliferative effects after transfecting miRNA mimics in cells. Finally， the expression level of miR-3127-5p in different HCC cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR.Results:Baicalein was able to inhibit the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phase via up-regulating the expression of p21/CDKN1A and P27/CDKN1B and suppressing the PI3K/Akt pathway. Baicalein could alter the miRNA expression profiles in Bel-7402 cells. Putative target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs could be enriched in terms of cell proliferation regulation， cell cycle arrest and were mainly involved in MAPK， PI3K-Akt， Wnt， Hippo and mTOR signaling pathways. MiR- 3127-5p， one of up-regulated miRNAs， exhibits low expression level in several HCC cell lines and its overexpression could inhibit cell growth of Bel-7402 and Hep3B cell lines by inducing S phase arrest by up-regulating the expression of p21and P27 and repressing the PI3K/Akt pathway.Conclusions:Modulation of miRNA expression may be an important mechanism underlying the anti-hepatoma effects of baicalein.Keywords:Anti-proliferative; Baicalein; Expression profiling; Hepatocellular carcinoma; MicroRNA.
Cytokines and chemokines are both expressed by human myoblasts: possible relevance for the immune pathogenesis of muscle inflammation.,Int Immunol, 2000 Sep,10967028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10967028/,The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are characterized by antibody- or cell-mediated immune response against unknown muscle tissue antigens. In these diseases a cellular infiltrate， composed of T and B lymphocytes， macrophages and NK cells， may invade muscle tissue with a gradient from the perivascular space to the endomysial compartment. Muscle cells may be actively involved in the processes of mononuclear cell recruitment and activation from the blood stream to the areas of inflammation. In order to verify this hypothesis， cultured human myoblasts were tested for their capacity to express different pro-inflammatory cytokines [IL-1alpha， IL-1beta， IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] and chemokines (IL-8， MCP-1 and RANTES) at the mRNA level and protein secretion， in the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha alone or in combination. We confirmed that human myoblasts expressed IL-1alpha and IL-6 constitutively， while IL-1beta and TNF-alpha are detected only after treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines; moreover， we observed that TNF-alpha was expressed on an autocrine fashion by myoblasts. IL-8 and RANTES were expressed constitutively while MCP-1 after proper induction. These molecular data were further confirmed by specific ELISA in the supernatant from cultured myoblasts. Our results underline the importance of human myoblasts in the recruitment of leukocytes from the blood stream and， most probably， in the cross-talk between infiltrating inflammatory cells and muscle cells， creating the conditions for a chronic inflammation. Moreover， the capacity of muscle cells to behave as cells of the immune system has to be kept in mind， also in view of i.m. vaccination and use of molecular engineered myoblasts as vehicles in gene therapy.
Decoupling of the PI3K Pathway via Mutation Necessitates Combinatorial Treatment in HER2+ Breast Cancer.,PLoS One, 2015 Jul 16,26181325,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26181325/,We report here on experimental and theoretical efforts to determine how best to combine drugs that inhibit HER2 and AKT in HER2(+) breast cancers. We accomplished this by measuring cellular and molecular responses to lapatinib and the AKT inhibitors (AKTi) GSK690693 and GSK2141795 in a panel of 22 HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines carrying wild type or mutant PIK3CA. We observed that combinations of lapatinib plus AKTi were synergistic in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(mut) cell lines but not in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(wt) cell lines. We measured changes in phospho-protein levels in 15 cell lines after treatment with lapatinib， AKTi or lapatinib + AKTi to shed light on the underlying signaling dynamics. This revealed that p-S6RP levels were less well attenuated by lapatinib in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(mut) cells compared to HER2(+)/PIK3CAwt cells and that lapatinib + AKTi reduced p-S6RP levels to those achieved in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(wt) cells with lapatinib alone. We also found that that compensatory up-regulation of p-HER3 and p-HER2 is blunted in PIK3CA(mut) cells following lapatinib + AKTi treatment. Responses of HER2(+) SKBR3 cells transfected with lentiviruses carrying control or PIK3CA(mut )sequences were similar to those observed in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(mut) cell lines but not in HER2(+)/PIK3CA(wt) cell lines. We used a nonlinear ordinary differential equation model to support the idea that PIK3CA mutations act as downstream activators of AKT that blunt lapatinib inhibition of downstream AKT signaling and that the effects of PIK3CA mutations can be countered by combining lapatinib with an AKTi. This combination does not confer substantial benefit beyond lapatinib in HER2+/PIK3CA(wt) cells.
Activity profile of the cisplatin analogue PN149 in different tumor cell lines.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2018 Oct,30138622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30138622/,The efficacy of the anticancer drug cisplatin is restricted by tumor cell resistance and occurrence of severe side effects. One strategy to overcome these limitations is the development of new， improved platinum drugs. Previous investigations showed that platinum(IV)-nitroxyl complexes are able to circumvent cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer cells. In the present study the mode of action of the platinum(IV)-nitroxyl complex PN149 was investigated in the bladder cancer cell line RT112 and the renal cell carcinoma cell line A498 on the molecular and cellular level. Gene expression analysis showed that PN149 induced genes related to DNA damage response (RRM2B， GADD45A)， cell cycle regulation (CDKN1A， PLK3， PPM1D) as well as those coding for the pro-apoptotic factors PUMA and Noxa. These findings on the transcriptional level were confirmed on the functional level revealing that PN149 treatment increased levels of p53 and resulted in cell cycle arrest and drug-induced cytotoxicity via induction of apoptosis. Regarding the expression of oxidative-stress sensitive genes， PN149 induced FTH1， GCLC， HMOX1 and TXNRD1 but relevant effects were restricted to RT112 cells treated with 50 µM. The pro-inflammatory IL-8 was induced by PN149 in RT112 but not A498 cells indicating a cell-type specific activation. Taken together， PN149 possessed promising activity in different tumor cell lines rendering it an interesting alternative to cisplatin in chemotherapy.Keywords:Cisplatin analogues; Gene expression profiling; Platinum nitroxyl complexes; Platinum resistance; Tumor cell lines.
Molecular features and vulnerabilities of recurrent chordomas.,J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 2021 Jul 30,34330313,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34330313/,Background:Tumor recurrence is one of the major challenges in clinical management of chordoma. Despite R0-resection， approximately 50% of chordomas recur within ten years after initial surgery. The underlying molecular processes are poorly understood resulting in the lack of associated therapeutic options. This is not least due to the absence of appropriate cell culture models of this orphan disease.Methods:The intra-personal progression model cell lines U-CH11 and U-CH11R were compared using array comparative genomic hybridization， expression arrays， RNA-seq， and immunocytochemistry. Cell line origin was confirmed by short tandem repeat analysis. Inter-personal cell culture models (n = 6) were examined to validate whether the new model is representative. Cell viability after HOX/PBX complex inhibition with small peptides was determined by MTS assays.Results:Using whole genome microarray analyses， striking differences in gene expression between primary and recurrent chordomas were identified. These expression differences were confirmed in the world's first intra-personal model of chordoma relapse consisting of cell lines established from a primary (U-CH11) and the corresponding recurrent tumor (U-CH11R). Array comparative genomic hybridization and RNA-sequencing analyses revealed profound genetic similarities between both cell lines pointing to transcriptomic reprogramming as a key mechanism of chordoma progression. Network analysis of the recurrence specific genes highlighted HOX/PBX signaling as a common dysregulated event. Hence， HOX/PBX complexes were used as so far unknown therapeutic targets in recurrent chordomas. Treating chordoma cell lines with the complex formation inhibiting peptide HXR9 induced cFOS mediated apoptosis in all chordoma cell lines tested. This effect was significantly stronger in cell lines established from chordoma relapses.Conclusion:Clearly differing gene expression patterns and vulnerabilities to HOX/PBX complex inhibition in highly therapy resistant chordoma relapses were identified using the first intra-personal loco-regional and further inter-personal chordoma progression models. For the first time， HOX/PBX interference was used to induce cell death in chordoma and might serve as the basic concept of an upcoming targeted therapy for chordomas of all progression stages.Keywords:Apoptosis; Cell lines; Chordoma; HOX; PBX; Progression model.
The selective activation of p53 target genes regulated by SMYD2 in BIX-01294 induced autophagy-related cell death.,PLoS One, 2015 Jan 6,25562686,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25562686/,Transcription regulation emerged to be one of the key mechanisms in regulating autophagy. Inhibitors of H3K9 methylation activates the expression of LC3B， as well as other autophagy-related genes， and promotes autophagy process. However， the detailed mechanisms of autophagy regulated by nuclear factors remain elusive. In this study， we performed a drug screen of SMYD2-/- cells and discovered that SMYD2 deficiency enhanced the cell death induced by BIX01294， an inhibitor of histone H3K9 methylation. BIX-01294 induces accumulation of LC3 II and autophagy-related cell death， but not caspase-dependent apoptosis. We profiled the global gene expression pattern after treatment with BIX-01294， in comparison with rapamycin. BIX-01294 selectively activates the downstream genes of p53 signaling， such as p21 and DOR， but not PUMA， a typical p53 target gene inducing apoptosis. BIX-01294 also induces other autophagy-related genes， such as ATG4A and ATG9A. SMYD2 is a methyltransferase for p53 and regulates its transcription activity. Its deficiency enhances the BIX-01294-induced autophagy-related cell death through transcriptionally promoting the expression of p53 target genes. Taken together， our data suggest BIX-01294 induces autophagy-related cell death and selectively activates p53 target genes， which is repressed by SMYD2 methyltransferase.
Functional characterization of HIC， a P2Y1 agonist， as a p53 stabilizer for prostate cancer cell death induction.,Future Med Chem, 2021 Nov,34505540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34505540/,Background:(1-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl)indoline-4-carbonitrile (HIC)， an agonist of the P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R)， induces cell death in prostate cancer cells. However， the molecular mechanism behind the inhibition of HIC in prostate cancer remains elusive.Methods & results:Here， to outline the inhibitory role of HIC on prostate cancer cells， PC-3 and DU145 cell lines were treated with the respective IC50concentrations， which reduced cell proliferation， adherence properties and spheroid formation. HIC was able to arrest the cell cycle at G1/S phase and also induced apoptosis and DNA damage， validated by gene expression profiling. HIC inhibited the prostate cancer cells' migration and invasion， revealing its antimetastatic ability. P2Y1R-targeted HIC affects p53， MAPK and NF-κB protein expression， thereby improving the p53 stabilization essential for G1/S arrest and cell death.Conclusion:These findings provide an insight on the potential use of HIC， which remains the mainstay treatment for prostate cancer.Keywords:P2Y1 receptor; apoptosis; cell death; prostate cancer; signaling pathways.
Molecular and functional characterization of allogantigen-specific anergic T cells suitable for cell therapy.,Haematologica, 2010 Dec,20713457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20713457/,Background:CD4(+) regulatory T cells are a specialized subset of T cells that actively control immune responses. Several experimental protocols have been used to expand natural regulatory T cells and to generate adaptive type 1 regulatory T cells for regulatory T-cell-based therapies.Design and methods:The ability of exogenous recombinant human interleukin-10 to induce alloantigen-specific anergy in T cells was investigated and compared to that of interleukin-10 derived from tolerogenic dendritic cells， in mixed lymphocyte cultures. A detailed characterization of the effector functions of the resulting anergized T cells is reported.Results:Interleukin-10， whether exogenous or derived from tolerogenic dendritic cells， induces a population of alloantigen-specific T cells (interleukin-10-anergized T cells) containing type 1 regulatory T cells， which are anergic and actively suppress alloantigen-specific effector T cells present within the mixed population. Interleukin-10-induced anergy is transforming growth factor-β independent， and is associated with a decreased frequency of alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors， but interleukin-10-anergized T cells are still responsive to third-party， bacterial， and viral antigens. Tolerogenic dendritic cells are more powerful than exogenous interleukin-10 in generating type 1 regulatory T-cell precursors， and are also effective in the context of HLA-matched donors.Conclusions:Based on these studies， we have developed an efficient and reproducible in vitro method to generate antigen-specific type 1 regulatory T-cell precursors starting from total peripheral blood cells with minimal cell manipulation and suitable for generating type 1 regulatory T cells for regulatory T-cell-based therapies.
Genetic Aberrations Associated with Photodynamic Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2019 Jul 2,31269724,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31269724/,Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment modality that utilizes three components: light (λ 650-750 nm)， a photosensitizer (PS) and molecular oxygen， which upon activation renders the modality effective. Colorectal cancer has one of the highest incident rates as well as a high mortality rate worldwide. In this study， a zinc (Zn) metal-based phthalocyanine (ZnPcSmix) PS was used to determine its efficacy for the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma cells (DLD-1 and Caco-2). Photoactivation of the PS was achieved by laser irradiation at a wavelength of 680 nm. Dose responses were performed to establish optimal PS concentration and irradiation fluence. A working combination of 20 µM ZnPcSmix and 5 J/cm2was used. Biochemical responses were determined after 1 or 24 h incubation post-treatment. Since ZnPcSmix is localized in lysosomes and mitochondria， mitochondrial destabilization analysis was performed monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Cytosolic acidification was determined measuring hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the cytoplasm. Having established apoptotic cell death induction， an apoptosis PCR array was performed to establish the apoptotic mechanism. In DLD-1 cells， expression of genes included 3 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated genes while in Caco-2 cells， there were 16 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated genes. In both cell lines， in up-regulated genes， there was a combination of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes that were significantly expressed. Gene expression results showed that more tumorigenic cells (DLD-1) went through apoptosis; however， they exhibit increased risk of resistance and recurrence， while less tumorigenic Caco-2 cells responded better to PDT， thus being suggestive of a better prognosis post-PDT treatment. In addition， the possible apoptotic mechanisms of cell death were deduced based on the genetic expression profiling of regulatory apoptotic inducing factors.Keywords:apoptotic pathway; colorectal cancer; photodynamic therapy; zinc phthalocyanine.
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals heterogenous microenvironments and specific drug response between cervical squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.,EBioMedicine, 2023 Nov,37879219,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37879219/,Background:Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and adenocarcinoma (CAde) are two major pathological types of cervical cancer (CC)， but their high-resolution heterogeneity of tumor and immune microenvironment remains elusive.Methods:Here， we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from five CSCC and three CAde samples， and systematically outlined their specific transcriptome atlas.Findings:We found CD8+T cells in CSCC were more cytotoxic but lower exhausted compared to those in CAde， and phagocytic MRC1+macrophages were specifically enriched in CSCC. Interestingly， we discovered that pro-tumoral cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myoCAFs) and cancer-associated vascular-fibroblasts (vCAFs) were more abundant in CSCC， and further verified their pro-metastatic roles in vitro. Furthermore， we also identified some specific chemotherapy drugs for CSCC (Dasatinib and Doramapimod) and CAde (Pyrimethamine and Lapatinib) by revealing their heterogeneity in transcriptomic profiles of malignant epithelial cells， and further verified their specific sensitivity in cell lines and constructed CC-derived organoids. Cell-cell communication networks revealed that the pathways of NRG1-ERBB2， and FN1-ITAG3 were specific for CAde and CSCC， respectively， which may partly explain the specificities of identified chemotherapy drugs.Interpretation:Our study described the immune heterogeneity and specific cellular interactions between CSCC and CAde， which could provide insights for uncovering pathogenesis and designing personalized treatment.Fundings:National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFC2701201)， National Natural Science Foundation of China (82072895， 82141106， 82103134， 81903114).Keywords:CAde; CSCC; Drug response; Microenvironments; snRNA-seq.
Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment.,bioRxiv [Preprint], 2023 Jul 23,37781626,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37781626/,Background:Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly， several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy， notably， histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such asVorinostatisand DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such asZebularine. However， a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity， i.e.， the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance， treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene leading to unintended adverse effect.Methods:Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample， we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning.Results:We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at 8 doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1μM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available， our model distinguished the post-treatment up versus downregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore， a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model.Conclusions:Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting.
MXD3 as an onco-immunological biomarker encompassing the tumor microenvironment， disease staging， prognoses， and therapeutic responses in multiple cancer types.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J, 2021 Sep 2,34584637,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34584637/,MAX dimerization (MXD) protein 3 (MXD3) is a member of the MXD family of basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factors that plays pivotal roles in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. However， there is insufficient scientific evidence on the pathogenic roles of MXD3 in various cancers and whether MXD3 plays a role in the immuno-oncology context of the tumor microenvironment， pathogenesis， prognosis， and therapeutic response of different tumors through certain common molecular mechanisms; thus， we saw a need to conduct the presentin silicopan-cancer study. Using various computational tools， we interrogated the role of MXD3 in tumor immune infiltration， immune evasion， tumor progression， therapy response， and prognosis of cohorts from various cancer types. Our results indicated that MXD3 was aberrantly expressed in almost all The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types and subtypes and was associated with the tumor stage， metastasis， and worse prognoses of various cohorts. Our results also suggested that MXD3 is associated with tumor immune evasion via different mechanisms involving T-cell exclusion in different cancer types and by tumor infiltration of immune cells in thymoma (THYM)， liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC)， and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). Methylation of MXD3 was inversely associated with messenger (m)RNA expression levels and mediated dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes and worse prognoses of cohorts from different cancer types. Finally， we found that genetic alterations and oncogenic features of MXD3 were concomitantly associated with deregulation of theDBN1，RAB24，SLC34A1，PRELID1，LMAN2，F12，GRK6，RGS14，PRR7， andPFN3genes and were connected to phospholipid transport and ion homeostasis. Our results also suggested that MXD3 expression is associated with immune or chemotherapeutic outcomes in various cancers. In addition， higher MXD3 expression levels were associated with decreased sensitivity of cancer cell lines to several mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors but led to increased activities of other kinase inhibitors， including Akt inhibitors. Interestingly， MXD3 exhibited higher predictive power for response outcomes and overall survival of immune checkpoint blockade sub-cohorts than three of seven standardized biomarkers. Altogether， our study strongly suggests that MXD3 is an immune-oncogenic molecule and could serve as a biomarker for cancer detection， prognosis， therapeutic design， and follow-up.Keywords:Chemotherapy; Gene expression profiling; Genetic and epigenetic alterations; Immune-cell infiltration; Immuno-oncology; Immunotherapy; MXD3; T-cell exclusion.
iDOMO: identification of drug combinations via multi-set operations for treating diseases.,Brief Bioinform, 2024 Nov 22,39973082,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39973082/,Combination therapy has become increasingly important for treating complex diseases which often involve multiple pathways and targets. However， experimental screening of drug combinations is costly and time-consuming. The availability of large-scale transcriptomic datasets (e.g. CMap and LINCS) from in vitro drug treatment experiments makes it possible to computationally predict drug combinations with synergistic effects. Towards this end， we developed a computational approach， termed Identification of Drug Combinations via Multi-Set Operations (iDOMO)， to predict drug synergy based on multi-set operations of drug and disease gene signatures. iDOMO quantifies the synergistic effect of a pair of drugs by taking into account the combination's beneficial and detrimental effects on treating a disease. We evaluated iDOMO， in a DREAM Challenge dataset with the matched， pre- and post-treatment gene expression data and cell viability information. We further evaluated the performance of iDOMO by concordance index and Spearman correlation on predicting the Highest Single Agency (HSA) synergy scores for four most common cancer types in two large-scale drug combination databases， showing that iDOMO significantly outperformed two existing popular drug combination approaches including the Therapeutic Score and the SynergySeq Orthogonality Score. Application of iDOMO to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) identified drug pairs with potential synergistic effects， with the combination of trifluridine and monobenzone being the most synergistic. Our in vitro experiments confirmed that the top predicted drug combination exerted a significant synergistic effect in inhibiting TNBC cell growth. In summary， iDOMO is an effective method for the in silico screening of synergistic drug combinations and will be a valuable tool for the development of novel therapeutics for complex diseases.Keywords:disease gene signature; drug combination; drug gene signature; drug repurposing; multiple set operations; synergistic effect.
Aloe-emodin as drug candidate for cancer therapy.,Oncotarget, 2018 Apr 3,29707146,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707146/, a leading cause of global mortality， cancer frequently cannot be cured due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore， novel drugs are required. Naturally occurring anthraquinones are mostly present inRumexandRhamnusspecies and are of interest because of their structural similarity to anthracyclines as well established anticancer drugs. In the present study， we focused on the structural elucidation of phytochemicals fromR. acetosellaas well as the investigation of cytotoxicity and modes of action of the main anthraquinone aglycons (emodin， Aloe-emodin， physcion， rhein). Resazurin reduction and protease viability marker assays were conducted to test their cytotoxicity. Microarray-based gene expression profiling was performed to identify cellular pathways affected by the compounds， which was validated by qPCR analyses and functional assays. Flow cytometry was used to measure cell cycle distribution， apoptosis and necrosis， induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The comet assay was used to detect DNA damage. Aloe-emodin as the most cytotoxic compound revealed IC50values from 9.872 μM to 22.3 μM in drug-sensitive wild-type cell lines and from 11.19 μM to 33.76 μM in drug-resistant sublines， was selected to investigate its mechanism against cancer. Aloe-emodin-induced S phase arrest， ROS generation， DNA damage and apoptosis. Microarray hybridization revealed a profile of deregulated genes in Aloe-emodin-treated CCRF-CEM cells with diverse functions such as cell death and survival， cellular growth and proliferation， cellular development， gene expression， cellular function and maintenance. Aloe-emodin as well asR. acetoselladeserve further investigations as possible antineoplastic drug candidates.Keywords:Aloe-emodin; Rumex acetosella; anthraquinone; cancer; multi-drug resistance.
Differential response of human bone marrow stromal cells to either TGF-β(1) or rhGDF-5.,Eur Spine J, 2011 Jun,21086000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21086000/,"Cell therapy along with growth factor injection is currently widely investigated to restore the intervertebral disc. However， there is increasing evidence that transplanted unconditioned bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) cannot thrive in the intervertebral disc ""niche"". Moreover， uncertainty exists with respect to the cell phenotype that would be suitable to inject. The intervertebral disc cell phenotype only recently has been started to be characterised using transcriptomics profiling. Recent findings suggest that cytokeratin 19 (KRT-19) could be used as a potential candidate marker for the intervertebral disc， or more specifically the nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) phenotype. We present in vitro cell culture data using alginate bead culture of primary human BMSCs exposed to the standard chondrogenic stimulus， transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β)， the growth and differentiation factor 5 and/or bovine NPCs to induce a potential ""discogenic"" pathway. Chondrogenic induction via TGF-β pathway provoked down-regulation of KRT-19 gene expression in four out of five donors after 18 days of culture， whereas KRT-19 expression remained unchanged in the ""discogenic"" groups. In addition， the ratio of aggrecan/collagen II gene expression showed a remarkable difference (of at least 3 magnitudes) between the chondrogenic stimulus (low ratio) and the discogenic stimulus (high ratio). Therefore， KRT-19 and aggrecan/collagen II ratio may be potential markers to distinguish chondrogenic from ""discogenic"" differentiation."
New insights of cerium oxide nanoparticles in head and neck cancer treatment.,Sci Rep, 2025 Mar 5,40044797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40044797/,Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a genetically complex cancer type having treatment difficulties due to affecting multiple organs in complex anatomical sites. Radiotherapy resistance， chemotoxicity， post-surgery disability makes HNC treatment more complicated. Therefore， there is need to developed new treatment approaches. Nanoparticle-based therapies especially cerium oxide nanoparticles with its anti-cancer features， high catalytic activity， anti- or pro-oxidant and radio-protective properties give a boon for HNC treatment. In the current study， two dextran-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles (Dex-CeNPs) namely SD1 and SD2 were synthesized and characterized by using two types of dextran (D1 and D2) having distinct molecular weights and branching characteristics to understand their potential as a new HNC treatment strategy while evaluating the role of dextran type. The effectivity of the SD1 and SD2 on the HNC cell lines (A253， SCC-25， FaDu) were investigated by analyzing their cytotoxicity， genotoxicity， reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation properties. Low IC50value， high ROS generation and stability profiling of SD2 compared to SD1 indicates the distinct function of dextran type on Dex-CeNPs effectivity on HNC. To better elucidate the effectivity of SD2， flow cytometry analysis and pro-apoptotic (TP53， CASP3， BAX) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression profiling were investigated in detail. The findings indicate that SD2 exhibits an influence on head and neck cancer cells via the apoptotic pathway. Our research sets the framework for the development of Dex-CeNPs as remarkable nanotherapeutic candidates for treatment of head and neck cancer.Keywords:Cerium oxide nanoparticle; Dextran coated nanoceria; Head and neck cancer; Nanotherapeutics.
The GLI genes as the molecular switch in disrupting Hedgehog signaling in colon cancer.,Oncotarget, 2011 Aug,21860067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21860067/,The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway leads to activation of GLI， which transcriptionally regulate target genes. Regulated HH signaling activity is critical during embryogenesis while aberrantly activated HH signaling is evident in a variety of human cancers. Canonical HH signaling engages the transmembrane receptor Patched (PTCH) and the signaling intermediate Smoothened (SMO) to activate GLI1 and GLI2. In addition GLI1 and GLI2 are activated by non-canonical oncogenic signaling pathways to further drive HH-dependent survival. We have demonstrated in human colon carcinoma cells that inhibition of the RAS/RAF pathway by U0126 decreases p-ERK protein expression and also inhibits GLI-luciferase activity and GLI1 mRNA and protein levels. Of importance is the demonstration that targeting of SMO (using cyclopamine) has minimal effect on cell survival in comparison to the inhibition of GLI (using GANT61)， which induced extensive cell death in 7/7 human colon carcinoma cell lines. Genetic inhibition of the function of GLI1 and GLI2 by transient transfection of the C-terminus deleted repressor GLI3R， reduced proliferation and induced cleavage of caspase-3 and cell death in HT29 cells， similar to the effects of GANT61. Mechanistically， downstream of GLI1 and GLI2 inhibition， γH2AX (a marker of DNA double strand breaks) expression was upregulated， and γH2AX nuclear foci were demonstrated in cells that expressed GLI3R. Activation of the ATM/Chk2 axis with co-localization of γH2AX and p-Chk2 nuclear foci were demonstrated following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition. GANT61 induced cellular accumulation at G1/S and early S with no further progression before cells became subG1， while cDNA microarray gene profiling demonstrated downregulation of genes involved in DNA replication， the DNA damage response， and DNA repair， mechanisms that are currently being pursued. These studies highlight the importance of targeting the GLI genes downstream of SMO for terminating HH-dependent survival， suggesting that GLI may constitute a molecular switch that determines the balance between cell survival and cell death in human colon carcinoma.
T-cell lymphoma: Microenvironment-related biomarkers.,Semin Cancer Biol, 2015 Oct,26057207,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26057207/,Mature T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies that occur in nodal and extranodal sites. The diverse tissues involved and the highly variable clinicopathologic features are related to an interaction between the neoplastic lymphoid cells and the tissues that they infiltrate. When different subpopulations of T-cells undergo transformation， they retain some of their inherent characteristics， including tissue tropisms， gene expression profiles and cytokine secretion patterns; which collaborate to impact on the cellular composition and structure of the lymphoma. Non-neoplastic cellular components of the lymphoma， including normal T and B lymphocytes， macrophages and eosinophils are altered by the neoplastic lymphoid cells， leading to changes in patterns of gene and protein expressions. These changes in turn modify the microenvironment of the lymphoma， inducing blood vessel formation and providing survival and proliferative signals to the neoplastic lymphoid cells. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages undergo M2 polarization as a result of the cytokines produced by the neoplastic T-cells. These macrophages in turn promote angiogenesis and inhibit anti-tumor cellular immunity. The macrophage content has been shown to correlate with treatment outcome in clinical studies. The effects of normal lymphocytes on T-cell lymphoma biology are more conflicting， with both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the neoplastic cells demonstrated in vitro. Endothelial cells from micro-vessels interact with neoplastic T-cells mainly through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. The prognostic and therapeutic significance of microvasculature have also been demonstrated in some clinical trials. This complex network of cellular， immunological and molecular interactions underlies the pathologies， clinical manifestations and treatment outcome of T-cell lymphomas. The understanding of the impact of the microenvironment on neoplastic T-cells should be further exploited in translational research to generate biomarkers that may be applicable to disease classification， treatment and prognostication.Keywords:Biomarkers; Cytokines; Gene expression profiling; Microenvironment; T-cell lymphomas.

Cellular studies of MrDb (DDX18).,Oncol Res, 2007,18351129,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18351129/,Helicases are present in viruses， prokaryotes， and eukaryotes， and several of them have been linked to human diseases. Here we study the role of one putative DEAD-box RNA helicase， MrDb (DDX18)， in tumor cells. We show that MrDb is a nucleolar protein ubiquitously expressed in tumor cells and that it is more abundantly expressed in proliferating cells. Inhibition of MrDb with dominant negative mutant or a shRNA reduces tumor cell proliferation without inducing a cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. These findings suggest that MrDb is important for cell proliferation and that its inhibition could prevent tumor cell proliferation.
Apelin enhances biological functions in lung cancer A549 cells by downregulating exosomal miR-15a-5p.,Carcinogenesis, 2021 Feb 25,32808032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32808032/,pelin acts as a tumor promoter in multiple malignant tumors; however， its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies have indicated that exosomes are pivotal to mediating tumor progression and metastasis. This study examined whether apelin enhances proliferation and invasion ability of lung cancer cells via exosomal microRNA (miRNA). Lung cancer A549 cells overexpressing apelin and control vector were generated by lentiviral transfection. Exosomes were isolated from the culture supernatant of each cell group and characterized. A-exo and V-exo were， respectively， cocultured with A549 cells， and assays of proliferation， apoptosis， colony formation and invasion were conducted. Exosomal miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) was performed on A-exo and V-exo to select a candidate miRNA. It was found that A549 cells absorbed more A-exo than V-exo， and A-exo could promote proliferation， colony formation， migration and invasion of A549 cells more than V-exo. Exosomal miRNA-seq data revealed that miR-15a-5p was markedly lower in A-exo compared with V-exo. Low expression of miR-15a-5p was also found in lung cancer tissues and cell lines， suggesting that miR-15a-5p may have an anti-tumor role. Overexpression of miR-15a-5p in A549 cells was associated with less cell proliferation， migration， invasion and suppressed cell cycle， and lower amounts of CDCA4 (cell division cycle-associated protein 4) indicated that it may be a potential target for miR-15a-5p. This study elucidated a novel regulatory mechanism that apelin may promote proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells by inhibiting miR-15a-5p encapsulated in exosomes.
Analyzing gene expression profile in K562 cells exposed to sodium valproate using microarray combined with the connectivity map database.,J Biomed Biotechnol, 2012,22701306,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22701306/,To explore the mechanism underlying antileukaemia effect of sodium valproate， the growth and survival of the K562 cell line were investigated. Global profiles of gene expression in K562 cells exposed to sodium valproate were assessed and validated. The differentially expressed genes identified were further used to query the connectivity map database to retrieve a ranked list of compounds that act on the same intracellular targets as sodium valproate. A significant increase in cell apoptosis and a change in gene expression profile were observed in valproate-exposed K562 cells. The significant enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms for the differentially expressed genes showed that these genes were involved in many important biological processes. Eight differentially expressed genes involved in apoptosis were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. The connectivity map analysis showed gene expression profile in K562 cells exposed to sodium valproate was most similar to that of HDACi and PI3K inhibitors， suggesting that sodium valproate might exert antileukaemic action by inhibiting HDAC as well as inhibiting PI3K pathway. In conclusion， our data might provide clues to elucidate the molecular and therapeutic potential of VPA in leukaemia treatment， and the connectivity map is a useful tool for exploring the molecular mechanism of drug action.

CDK7 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for lung squamous cell carcinomas with a SOX2 amplification.,Cell Oncol (Dordr), 2019 Aug,30838525,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30838525/,Purpose:Despite the development of molecular targeted therapies， few advances have been made in the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SOX2 amplification is one of the most common genetic alterations in SCC. Here， we investigated the effects of THZ1， a potent cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor that plays a key role in gene transcription， in SCC.Methods:Lung SCC-derived cell viabilities were assessed using a CCK-8 assay. SOX2 expression and RNAPII-CTD phosphorylation levels after THZ1 treatment were determined by Western blotting. The effect of SOX2 suppression using shRNA was assessed by flow cytometry. Gene expression patterns after THZ1 treatment of lung SCC-derived cells were identified using microarray-based mRNA profiling.Results:We found that THZ1 treatment led to suppression of cell growth and apoptotic cell death in SOX2-amplified SCC-derived cells only， whereas the modest growth-inhibitory effect of cisplatin did not differ according to SOX2 amplification status. We also found that THZ1 decreased the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and the expression of several genes. Specifically， we found that the expression of transcription-associated genes， including SOX2， was down-regulated by THZ1 in SOX2-amplified SCC cells. This inhibition of SOX2 expression resulted in suppression of the growth of these cells.Conclusions:From our data， we conclude that THZ1 may effectively control the proliferation and survival of SOX2-amplified SCC cells through a decrease in global transcriptional activity， suggesting that CDK7 inhibition leading to transcription suppression may be a promising therapeutic option for lung SCC with a SOX2 amplification.Keywords:CDK7; SOX2; Squamous cell lung cancer (SCC); THZ1; Transcriptional addiction.

Decidual T Cells Exhibit a Highly Differentiated Phenotype and Demonstrate Potential Fetal Specificity and a Strong Transcriptional Response to IFN.,J Immunol, 2017 Nov 15,28986438,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28986438/,Immune tolerance during human pregnancy is maintained by a range of modifications to the local and systemic maternal immune system. Lymphoid infiltration is seen at the implantation site of the fetal-maternal interface， and decidual NK cells have been demonstrated to facilitate extravillous trophoblast invasion into maternal decidua during the first trimester， optimizing hemochorial placentation. However， although there is considerable T cell infiltration of the maternal decidua， the functional properties of this T cell response remain poorly defined. We investigated the specificity and regulation of CD4+and CD8+T cells obtained from human third trimester decidua and demonstrated that decidual CD4+and CD8+T cells exhibit a highly differentiated effector memory phenotype in comparison with peripheral blood and display increased production of IFN-γ and IL-4. Moreover， decidual T cells proliferated in response to fetal tissue， and depletion of T regulatory cells led to an increase in fetal-specific proliferation. HY-specific T cells were detectable in the decidua of women with male pregnancies and were shown to be highly differentiated. Transcriptional analysis of decidual T cells revealed a unique gene profile characterized by elevated expression of proteins associated with the response to IFN signaling. These data have considerable importance both for the study of healthy placentation and for the investigation of the potential importance of fetal-specific alloreactive immune responses within disorders of pregnancy.

Bosutinib， dasatinib， imatinib， nilotinib， and ponatinib differentially affect the vascular molecular pathways and functionality of human endothelial cells.,Leuk Lymphoma, 2019 Jan,29741440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29741440/,The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)， nilotinib， ponatinib， and dasatinib (but not bosutinib or imatinib)， are associated with vascular adverse events (VAEs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Though the mechanism is inadequately understood， an effect on vascular cells has been suggested. We investigated the effect of imatinib， nilotinib， dasatinib， bosutinib， and ponatinib on tube formation， cell viability， and gene expression of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found a distinct genetic profile in HUVECs treated with dasatinib， ponatinib， and nilotinib compared to bosutinib and imatinib， who resembled untreated samples. However， unique gene expression and molecular pathway alterations were detected between dasatinib， ponatinib， and nilotinib. Angiogenesis/blood vessel-related pathways and HUVEC function (tube formation/viability) were adversely affected by dasatinib， ponatinib， and nilotinib but not by imatinib or bosutinib. These results correspond to the differences in VAE profiles of these TKIs， support a direct effect on vascular cells， and provide direction for future research.Keywords:CML; angiogenesis; endothelial cells; vascular biology.

Antitumor activity and expression profiles of genes induced by sulforaphane in human melanoma cells.,Eur J Nutr, 2018 Oct,28864908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28864908/,Purpose:Human melanoma is a highly aggressive incurable cancer due to intrinsic cellular resistance to apoptosis， reprogramming， proliferation and survival during tumour progression. Sulforaphane (SFN)， an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables， plays a role in carcinogenesis in many cancer types. However， the cytotoxic molecular mechanisms and gene expression profiles promoted by SFN in human melanoma remain unknown.Methods:Three different cell lines were used: two human melanoma A375 and 501MEL and human epidermal melanocytes (HEMa). Cell viability and proliferation， cell cycle analysis， cell migration and invasion and protein expression and phosphorylation status of Akt and p53 upon SFN treatment were determined. RNA-seq of A375 was performed at different time points after SFN treatment.Results:We demonstrated that SFN strongly decreased cell viability and proliferation， induced G2/M cell cycle arrest， promoted apoptosis through the activation of caspases 3， 8， 9 and hampered migration and invasion abilities in the melanoma cell lines. Remarkably， HEMa cells were not affected by SFN treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed regulation of genes involved in response to stress， apoptosis/cell death and metabolic processes. SFN upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic genes， such as p53， BAX， PUMA， FAS and MDM2; promoted cell cycle inhibition and growth arrest by upregulating EGR1， GADD45B， ATF3 and CDKN1A; and simultaneously acted as a potent inhibitor of genotoxicity by launching the stress-inducible protein network (HMOX1， HSPA1A， HSPA6， SOD1).Conclusion:Overall， the data show that SFN cytotoxicity in melanoma derives from complex and concurrent mechanisms during carcinogenesis， which makes it a promising cancer prevention agent.Keywords:Apoptosis; Melanocytes; Melanoma; RNA-Seq; Sulforaphane; Transcriptome.
Deep learning identifies heterogeneous subpopulations in breast cancer cell lines.,bioRxiv [Preprint], 2024 Jul 4,39005432,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39005432/,Motivation:Cells exhibit a wide array of morphological features， enabling computer vision methods to identify and track relevant parameters. Morphological analysis has long been implemented to identify specific cell types and cell responses. Here we asked whether morphological features might also be used to classify transcriptomic subpopulations withinin vitrocancer cell lines. Identifying cell subpopulations furthers our understanding of morphology as a reflection of underlying cell phenotype and could enable a better understanding of how subsets of cells compete and cooperate in disease progression and treatment.Results:We demonstrate that cell morphology can reflect underlying transcriptomic differencesin vitrousing convolutional neural networks. First， we find that changes induced by chemotherapy treatment are highly identifiable in a breast cancer cell line. We then show that the intra cell line subpopulations that comprise breast cancer cell lines under standard growth conditions are also identifiable using cell morphology. We find that cell morphology is influenced by neighborhood effects beyond the cell boundary， and that including image information surrounding the cell can improve model discrimination ability.
Targeting JUN， CEBPB， and HDAC3: A Novel Strategy to Overcome Drug Resistance in Hypoxic Glioblastoma.,Front Oncol, 2019 Feb 1,30775317,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30775317/,Hypoxia is a predominant feature in glioblastoma (GBM) and contributes greatly to its drug resistance. However， the molecular mechanisms which are responsible for the development of the resistant phenotype of GBM under hypoxic conditions remain unclear. To analyze the key pathways promoting therapy resistance in hypoxic GBM， we utilized the U87-MG cell line as a human GBM cell model and the human brain HEB cell line as a non-neoplastic brain cell model. These cell lines were cultured in the presence of 21， 5， and 1% O2for 24 h. We detected the changes in transcriptional profiling and analyzed the biological processes and functional interactions for the genes with different expression levels under different hypoxia conditions. The results indicated that those alterations of U87-MG cells presented specific transcriptional signature in response to diverse hypoxia levels. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the genes related to the DNA replication and cell cycle were suppressed， while the genes involved in tissue and system development to promote cancer development were activated following hypoxia. Moreover， functional interaction analysis suggested that the epigenetic regulator HDAC3 and the transcriptional factors CEBPB and JUN played a central role in organ and system developmental process pathway. Previous studies reported the global alterations caused by activation of HDAC3， CEBPB， and JUN could form the molecular basis of the resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy of hypoxic GBM. In our study， the significant growth inhibitory effect of temozolomide on hypoxic GBM cells could be promoted under downregulation of these genes. The experiment suggested that HDAC3， CEBPB， and JUN were closely involved in the drug-resistance phenotype of hypoxic GBM. In summary， we profiled the hypoxia-dependent changes in the transcriptome of the U87-MG cell line and the human brain cell line HEB to identify the transcriptional signatures of U87-MG cells and elucidate the role of hypoxia in the drug-resistant phenotype of GBM. Furthermore， we identified three key genes and explored their important roles in the drug resistance of hypoxic GBM.Keywords:CEBPB; HDAC3; JUN; drug resistance; glioblastoma; hypoxia.
Diversity through phosphine catalysis identifies octahydro-1，6-naphthyridin-4-ones as activators of endothelium-driven immunity.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2011 Apr 26,21383121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21383121/,The endothelium plays a critical role in promoting inflammation in cardiovascular disease and other chronic inflammatory conditions， and many small-molecule screens have sought to identify agents that prevent endothelial cell activation. Conversely， an augmented immune response can be protective against microbial pathogens and in cancer immunotherapy. Yet， small-molecule screens to identify agents that induce endothelial cell activation have not been reported. In this regard， a bioassay was developed that identifies activated endothelium by its capacity to trigger macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta from primary monocytes. Subsequently， a 642-compound library of 39 distinctive scaffolds generated by a diversity-oriented synthesis based on the nucleophilic phosphine catalysis was screened for small molecules that activated the endothelium. Among the active compounds identified， the major classes were synthesized through the sequence of phosphine-catalyzed annulation， Tebbe reaction， Diels-Alder reaction， and in some cases， hydrolysis. Ninety-six analogs of one particular class of compounds， octahydro-1，6-naphthyridin-4-ones， were efficiently prepared by a solid-phase split-and-pool technique and by solution phase analog synthesis. Structure-function analysis combined with transcriptional profiling of active and inactive octahydro-1，6-naphthyridin-4-one analogs identified inflammatory gene networks induced exclusively by the active compound. The identification of a family of chemical probes that augment innate immunity through endothelial cell activation provides a framework for understanding gene networks involved in endothelial inflammation as well as the development of novel endothelium-driven immunotherapeutic agents.
Antigen-stimulated PBMC transcriptional protective signatures for malaria immunization.,Sci Transl Med, 2020 May 13,32404508,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32404508/,Identifying immune correlates of protection and mechanisms of immunity accelerates and streamlines the development of vaccines. RTS，S/AS01E， the most clinically advanced malaria vaccine， has moderate efficacy in African children. In contrast， immunization with sporozoites under antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (CPS immunization) can provide 100% sterile protection in naïve adults. We used systems biology approaches to identifying correlates of vaccine-induced immunity based on transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals immunized with RTS，S/AS01E or chemoattenuated sporozoites stimulated with parasite antigens in vitro. Specifically， we used samples of individuals from two age cohorts and three African countries participating in an RTS，S/AS01E pediatric phase 3 trial and malaria-naïve individuals participating in a CPS trial. We identified both preimmunization and postimmunization transcriptomic signatures correlating with protection. Signatures were validated in independent children and infants from the RTS，S/AS01E phase 3 trial and individuals from an independent CPS trial with high accuracies (>70%). Transcription modules revealed interferon， NF-κB， Toll-like receptor (TLR)， and monocyte-related signatures associated with protection. Preimmunization signatures suggest that priming the immune system before vaccination could potentially improve vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Last， signatures of protection could be useful to determine efficacy in clinical trials， accelerating vaccine candidate testing. Nevertheless， signatures should be tested more extensively across multiple cohorts and trials to demonstrate their universal predictive capacity.
Investigation of osteosarcoma genomics and its impact on targeted therapy: an international collaboration to conquer human osteosarcoma.,Chin J Cancer, 2014 Dec,25418192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25418192/,Osteosarcoma is a genetically unstable malignancy that most frequently occurs in children and young adults. The lack of progress in managing this devastating disease in the clinic has prompted international researchers to collaborate to profile key genomic alterations that define osteosarcoma. A team of researchers and clinicians from China， Finland， and the United States investigated human osteosarcoma by integrating transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq)， high-density genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)， fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)， reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)， Sanger sequencing， cell culture， and molecular biological approaches. Systematic analysis of genetic/genomic alterations and further functional studies have led to several important findings， including novel rearrangement hotspots， osteosarcoma-specific LRP1-SNRNP25 and KCNMB4-CCND3 fusion genes， VEGF and Wnt signaling pathway alterations， deletion of the WWOX gene， and amplification of the APEX1 and RUNX2 genes. Importantly， these genetic events associate significantly with pathogenesis， prognosis， progression， and therapeutic activity in osteosarcoma， suggesting their potential impact on improved managements of human osteosarcoma. This international initiative provides opportunities for developing new treatment modalities to conquer osteosarcoma.
Nanoparticle-Encapsulated Camptothecin: Epigenetic Modulation in DNA Repair Mechanisms in Colon Cancer Cells.,Molecules, 2021 Sep 6,34500845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34500845/,Molecular crosstalk between the cellular epigenome and genome converge as a synergistic driver of oncogenic transformations. Besides other pathways， epigenetic regulatory circuits exert their effect towards cancer progression through the induction of DNA repair deficiencies. We explored this mechanism using a camptothecin encapsulated in β-cyclodextrin-EDTA-Fe3O4nanoparticles (CPT-CEF)-treated HT29 cells model. We previously demonstrated that CPT-CEF treatment of HT29 cells effectively induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest， stalling cancer progression. A comparative transcriptome analysis of CPT-CEF-treated versus untreated HT29 cells indicated that genes controlling mismatch repair， base excision repair， and homologues recombination were downregulated in these cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that treatment with CPT-CEF alleviated this repression. We observed that CPT-CEF exerts its effect by possibly affecting the DNA repair mechanism through epigenetic modulation involving genes ofHMGB1，APEX1， andPOLE3. Hence， we propose that CPT-CEF could be a DNA repair modulator that harnesses the cell's epigenomic plasticity to amend DNA repair deficiencies in cancer cells.Keywords:DNA repair; colon cancer; epigenetic modulation; nanoparticles; transcriptome analysis.
Biological reprogramming in acquired resistance to endocrine therapy of breast cancer.,Oncogene, 2010 Nov 11,20711236,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20711236/,Endocrine therapies targeting the proliferative effect of 17β-estradiol through estrogen receptor α (ERα) are the most effective systemic treatment of ERα-positive breast cancer. However， most breast tumors initially responsive to these therapies develop resistance through molecular mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. The long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) MCF7 cell model has been proposed to recapitulate acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women. To elucidate this resistance， genomic， transcriptomic and molecular data were integrated into the time course of MCF7-LTED adaptation. Dynamic and widespread genomic changes were observed， including amplification of the ESR1 locus consequently linked to an increase in ERα. Dynamic transcriptomic profiles were also observed that correlated significantly with genomic changes and were predicted to be influenced by transcription factors known to be involved in acquired resistance or cell proliferation (for example， interferon regulatory transcription factor 1 and E2F1， respectively) but， notably， not by canonical ERα transcriptional function. Consistently， at the molecular level， activation of growth factor signaling pathways by EGFR/ERBB/AKT and a switch from phospho-Ser118 (pS118)- to pS167-ERα were observed during MCF7-LTED adaptation. Evaluation of relevant clinical settings identified significant associations between MCF7-LTED and breast tumor transcriptome profiles that characterize ERα-negative status， early response to letrozole and tamoxifen， and recurrence after tamoxifen treatment. In accordance with these profiles， MCF7-LTED cells showed increased sensitivity to inhibition of FGFR-mediated signaling with PD173074. This study provides mechanistic insight into acquired resistance to endocrine therapies of breast cancer and highlights a potential therapeutic strategy.
Combined Treatment with Bojungikgi-tang (Buzhong Yiqi Decoction) and Riluzole Attenuates Cell Death in TDP-43-Expressing Cells.,Chin J Integr Med, 2024 Jul,37695446,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37695446/,Objective:To examine the effect of combined treatment with Bojungikgi-tang (BJIGT， Buzhong Yiqi Decoction) and riluzole (RZ) in transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) stress granule (SG) cells， a amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cell line using transcriptomic and molecular techniques.Methods:TDP-43 SG cells were pretreated with BJIGT (100 µg/mL)， RZ (50 µmol/L)， and combined BJIGT (100 µg/mL)/RZ (50 µmol/L) for 6 h before treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS， 200 µmol/L). Cell viability assay was performed to elucidate cell toxicity in TDP-43 SC cells using a cell-counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay kit. The expression levels of cell death-related proteins， including Bax， caspase 1， cleaved caspase 3 and DJ1 in TDP-43 SG cells were examined by Western blot analysis. The autophagy-related proteins， including pmTOR/mTOR， LC3b， P62， ATG7 and Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (Bag3) were investigated using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays.Results:Cell viability assay and Western blot analysis showed that combined treatment with BJIGT and RZ suppressed LPS-induced cell death and expression of cell death-related proteins， including Bax， caspase 1， and DJ1 (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays showed that combined treatment with BJIGT and RZ reduced LPS-induced formation of TDP-43 aggregates and regulated autophagy-related protein levels， including p62， light chain 3b， Bag3， and ATG7， in TDP-43-expressing cells (P<0.05 or P<0.01).Conclusion:The combined treatment of BJIGT and RZ might reduce inflammation and regulate autophagy dysfunction in TDP-43-induced ALS.Keywords:Bojungikgi-tang; Buzhong Yiqi Decoction; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; autophagy; oxidative stress; transactive response DNA-binding protein 43.
Polyethylene Glycol-Coated Graphene Oxide Loaded with Erlotinib as an Effective Therapeutic Agent for Treating Nasopharyngeal Cancer Cells.,Int J Nanomedicine, 2020 Oct 7,33116488,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33116488/,Introduction:Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer in southern China and Taiwan， and radiation therapy combined with or without chemotherapy is its mainstay treatment. Although it is highly sensitive to radiotherapy， local recurrence and distant metastasis remain difficult unsolved problems. In recent years， graphene oxide (GO) has been found to be a promising novel anticancer drug carrier. Here， we present our designed functionalized GO， polyethylene glycol-coated GO (GO-PEG)， as a drug carrier， which was loaded with erlotinib and showed promising anticancer effects on NPC cells.Methods:The effects of GO-PEG-erlotinib on the proliferation， migration， and invasion of NPC cells were investigated by WST-8 assay， wound healing assay， and invasion assay， respectively. RNA sequencing was conducted and analyzed to determine the molecular mechanisms by which GO-PEG-erlotinib affects NPC cells.Results:Our results showed that GO-PEG-erlotinib reduced NPC cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and also inhibited the migration and invasion of NPC cells. The RNA sequencing revealed several related molecular mechanisms.Conclusion:GO-PEG-erlotinib effectively suppressed NPC cell proliferation， migration， and invasion， likely by several mechanisms. GO-PEG-erlotinib may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating NPC in the future.Keywords:anti-cancer; drug carrier; erlotinib; graphene oxide; nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
The synergistic effect of BCR signaling inhibitors combined with an HDAC inhibitor on cell death in a mantle cell lymphoma cell line.,Apoptosis, 2015 Jul,25835755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25835755/,Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B cell malignancy characterized by aberrant expression of cyclin D1 due to a t(11;14) translocation. MCL is refractory to conventional chemotherapy， and treatment remains challenging. We investigated the efficacy of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat combined with one of several B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors on MCL cell death and the underlying mechanisms， using MCL cell lines. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor PCI-32765 and the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor R406 showed synergistic effects with vorinostat on growth inhibition. Treatment with PCI-32765 or R406 alone induced 27.3 ± 2.1 or 25.1 ± 3.2% apoptosis. When combined with vorinostat， these apoptotic fractions significantly increased to 50.8 ± 4.9 and 63.1 ± 5.0%， respectively. Activation of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were markedly increased. We performed gene expression profiling following treatment with the combination of vorinostat and individual BCR signaling inhibitors using a microarray， and differentially expressed genes were identified. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway was significantly enriched following treatment with the combination of vorinostat and R406. Protein expression analysis confirmed the down-regulation of NF-κB1/p105 and cyclin D1， suggesting inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Taken together， the combination of an HDAC inhibitor and a BCR signaling inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic strategy for MCL.
Association of CpG island methylator phenotype and EREG/AREG methylation and expression in colorectal cancer.,Br J Cancer, 2016 Jun 14,27272216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27272216/,Background:High EREG and AREG expression， and left-sided primary tumours are associated with superior efficacy of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)， but a unifying explanation of these findings is lacking.Methods:RNA-seq， gene expression arrays， and DNA methylation profiling were completed on 179 CRC tumours. Results were validated using independent The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets. An independent cohort of 198 KRAS wild-type metastatic CRC tumours was tested for CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status， and progression-free survival (PFS) with the first anti-EGFR regimen was retrospectively determined.Results:EREG and AREG expression was highly inversely correlated with methylation and was inversely associated with right-sided primary tumour， BRAF mutation， and CIMP-high status. Treatment of CRC cell lines with hypomethylating agents decreased methylation and increased expression of EREG. Inferior PFS with anti-EGFR therapy was associated with CIMP-high status， BRAF mutation， NRAS mutation， and right-sided primary tumour on univariate analysis. Among known BRAF/NRAS wild-type tumours， inferior PFS remained associated with CIMP-high status (median PFS 5.6 vs 9.0 mo， P=0.023).Conclusions:EREG and AREG are strongly regulated by methylation， and their expression is associated with CIMP status and primary tumour site， which may explain the association of primary tumour site and EREG/AREG expression with anti-EGFR therapy efficacy.
Genome-Wide Profiling of the Toxic Effect of Bortezomib on Human Esophageal Carcinoma Epithelial Cells.,Technol Cancer Res Treat, 2019 Jan 1,30961474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30961474/,Objectives:Bortezomib has been widely used to treat multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies. However， not much is known about its effect on solid tumors. The aim of this study was to study the effect of Bortezomib on human esophageal cancer cell lines and investigate the potential target pathways.Methods:Two human esophageal cancer cell lines， TE-1 and KYSE-150， were used in this study. Cell viability， cell cycle distribution， and apoptosis after Bortezomib treatment was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8， flow cytometry， and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining， respectively. The genes targeted by Bortezomib were analyzed at the messenger RNA level by microarray chips and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Results:The proliferation of human esophageal cancer cell lines was inhibited by Bortezomib in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Bortezomib treatment led to G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Microarray chips revealed multiple signaling pathways targeted by Bortezomib， including proteasome， endoplasmic reticulum， Wnt-， and calcium-mediated pathway. The expression patterns of 4 representative genes UBD， CUL3， HDAC6， and GADD45A were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and showed consistency with the microarray assay.Conclusion:Bortezomib could suppress cell viability， cause G2/M arrest， and induce apoptosis in human esophageal cancer cells， with possible targets including UBD， CUL3， HDAC6， and GADD45A.Keywords:G/M arrest; apoptosis; bortezomib; esophageal cancer; microarray.
Landscape of stimulation-responsive chromatin across diverse human immune cells.,Nat Genet, 2019 Oct,31570894,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570894/, hallmark of the immune system is the interplay among specialized cell types transitioning between resting and stimulated states. The gene regulatory landscape of this dynamic system has not been fully characterized in human cells. Here we collected assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing data under resting and stimulated conditions for up to 32 immune cell populations. Stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling， including response elements shared between stimulated B and T cells. Furthermore， several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types， highlighting the importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Allele-specific read mapping identified variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions， allowing us to observe evidence of function for a candidate causal variant that is undetected by existing large-scale studies in resting cells. Our results provide a resource of chromatin dynamics and highlight the need to characterize the effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells.
CD200Rhigh neutrophils with dysfunctional autophagy establish systemic immunosuppression by increasing regulatory T cells.,Cell Mol Immunol, 2024 Apr,38311677,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38311677/,Distinct neutrophil populations arise during certain pathological conditions. The generation of dysfunctional neutrophils during sepsis and their contribution to septicemia-related systemic immune suppression remain unclear. In this study， using an experimental sepsis model that features immunosuppression， we identified a novel population of pathogenic CD200Rhighneutrophils that are generated during the initial stages of sepsis and contribute to systemic immune suppression by enhancing regulatory T (Treg) cells. Compared to their CD200Rlowcounterparts， sepsis-generated CD200Rhighneutrophils exhibit impaired autophagy and dysfunction， with reduced chemotactic migration， superoxide anion production， and TNF-α production. Increased soluble CD200 blocks autophagy and neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow during experimental sepsis， and recombinant CD200 treatment in vitro can induce neutrophil dysfunction similar to that observed in CD200Rhighneutrophils. The administration of an α-CD200R antibody effectively reversed neutrophil dysfunction by enhancing autophagy and protecting against a secondary infection challenge， leading to increased survival. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CD200Rhighneutrophils expressed high levels of Igf1， which elicits the generation of Tregcells， while the administration of an α-CD200R antibody inhibited Tregcell generation in a secondary infection model. Taken together， our findings revealed a novel CD200Rhighneutrophil population that mediates the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced systemic immunosuppression by generating Tregcells.Keywords:Autophagy; CD200R; IGF-1; Neutrophils; Regulatory T cells; Sepsis.
CSB promoter downregulation via histone H3 hypoacetylation is an early determinant of replicative senescence.,Nat Commun, 2019 Dec 6,31811121,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31811121/,Cellular senescence has causative links with ageing and age-related diseases， however， it remains unclear if progeroid factors cause senescence in normal cells. Here， we show that depletion of CSB， a protein mutated in progeroid Cockayne syndrome (CS)， is the earliest known trigger of p21-dependent replicative senescence. CSB depletion promotes overexpression of the HTRA3 protease resulting in mitochondrial impairments， which are causally linked to CS pathological phenotypes. The CSB promoter is downregulated by histone H3 hypoacetylation during DNA damage-response. Mechanistically， CSB binds to the p21 promoter thereby downregulating its transcription and blocking replicative senescence in a p53-independent manner. This activity of CSB is independent of its role in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. HTRA3 accumulation and senescence are partially rescued upon reduction of oxidative/nitrosative stress. These findings establish a CSB/p21 axis that acts as a barrier to replicative senescence， and link a progeroid factor with the process of regular ageing in human.
deltaNp63alpha enhances the oncogenic phenotype of osteosarcoma cells by inducing the expression of GLI2.,BMC Cancer, 2014 Aug 1,25085524,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25085524/,Background:ΔNp63， a splice variant of p63， is overexpressed and exhibits oncogenic activity in many cancers including pancreatic and breast cancer and promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Despite its role in tumorigenesis， mechanistic activity of ΔNp63 mediated oncogenic function in osteosarcoma is poorly understood.Methods:The expression levels of p63 isoforms in osteosarcoma cell lines were identified using quantitative techniques. Expression profiling using microarray， siRNA mediated loss-of-function， and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were employed to identify novel ΔNp63α targets in p63-null osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells that were engineered to express ΔNp63α. The phenotype of SaOS-2-ΔNp63α cells was assessed using wound-healing， colony formation， and proliferation assays.Results:The comparative expression analyses identified ΔNp63α as the predominant p63 isoform expressed by invasive OS cell lines. Phenotypic analyses of SaOS-2-ΔNp63α cells in vitro indicate that ΔNp63α imparted tumorigenic attributes upon tumor cells. Further， we show that in osteosarcoma cells ΔNp63α directly regulated the transcription factor GLI2， which is a component of the hedgehog signaling pathway， and that functional interactions between ΔNp63α and GLI2 confer oncogenic properties upon OS cells.Conclusions:Here， we report that GLI2 is the novel target gene of ΔNp63α and that ΔNp63α-GLI2 crosstalk in osteosarcoma cells is a necessary event in osteosarcoma progression. Defining the exact mechanisms involved in this interaction that mediate the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma promises to identify targets for drug therapy.
Molecular determinants of etoposide resistance in HL60 cells.,Bioinformation, 2022 Oct 31,37654838,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37654838/,Chemotherapy resistance is the main reason for treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the major cause of its mortality. Etoposide is a DNA topoisomerase-II inhibitor that is used either as a single agent or in combination with cytarabine， azacytidine， vinca alkaloids， and anthracyclines for the treatment of relapsed /refractory AML. In this study， we sought to determine and understand the mechanism of etoposide resistance in AML using the HL60 cell line.HL60 cells were treated with incremental doses of etoposide and resistant colonies were isolated by culturing the resistant cells in semi-solid culture media. Three clones were selected for etoposide resistance namely， HL60-EtopR H1A， HL60-EtopR H1B， and HL60-EtopR H1C which demonstrated 4.78， 2.39， and 4.42-fold higher resistance to etoposide compared with the parental cells. To determine molecular differences between the etoposide-resistant HL60-EtopR cells and the parental cells， microarray-based gene expression profiling was performed. We found up regulation of members of the src tyrosine kinase family genes in the etoposide resistant cells. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of Src inhibitors in targeting etoposide resistant cells.Keywords:Acute Myeloid Leukemia; Apoptosis; Cancer; Chemotherapy; Etoposide; Multidrug Resistance.
OCT4-mediated transcription confers oncogenic advantage for a subset of gastric tumors with poor clinical outcome.,Funct Integr Genomics, 2022 Dec,35987846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35987846/,Deregulated transcription programs and signaling pathways are the critical factors involved in the process of carcinogenesis. Signaling pathway-based classification of tumors is expected to pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutics. We investigated the OCT4-mediated transcription program in the gene expression profiles of 939 gastric tumor samples. A set of 84 genes showing positive correlation with the activation pattern of the available OCT4 gene sets were found to consistently express in diffuse， poorly differentiated， and stage-III gastric tumors with poor prognosis. We also developed stable OCT4-silenced gastric cancer cells and the resultant gene expression changes were investigated by genome-wide mRNA profiling. Functional genomic investigation of the genes downregulated in OCT4-silenced cells and the pathways co-activated with OCT4 gene set across gastric tumors revealed the positive association of dysregulated OCT4 with TGF-β， GLI， PRC2/EzH2， Wnt， KRAS， STK33， and YAP signaling pathways in diffuse subtype gastric tumors. Elevated expression of OCT4 gene set was identified to represent the previously described EMT_UP as well as the GENOMICALLY STABLE subtypes of gastric tumors. Integrative genomic screening of the drug sensitivity of gastric cancer cells in correlation with the expression of OCT4 gene set across drug sensitivity databases revealed the inhibitors of tyrosine kinases， HDAC， and HSP90 to have a negative correlation and needs to be investigated for their potential therapeutic features for the subset of OCT4-activated gastric tumors. Thus， the subset of gastric tumors with OCT4 activation， the associated oncogenic signaling pathways， and potential therapeutic candidates were identified for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.Keywords:EMT; Gastric cancer; Genomically stable; OCT4; Targeted therapy.
Comparing genotoxic signatures in cord blood cells from neonates exposed in utero to zidovudine or tenofovir.,AIDS, 2015 Jul 17,25513819,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25513819/,Objectives:Zidovudine and tenofovir are the two main nucleos(t)ide analogs used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In vitro， both drugs bind to and integrate into human DNA and inhibit telomerase. The objective of the present study was to assess the genotoxic effects of either zidovudine or tenofovir-based combination therapies on cord blood cells in newborns exposed in utero.Design:We compared the aneuploid rate and the gene expression profiles in cord blood samples from newborns exposed either to zidovudine or tenofovir-based combination therapies during pregnancy and from unexposed controls (n = 8， 9， and 8， respectively).Methods:The aneuploidy rate was measured on the cord blood T-cell karyotype. Gene expression profiles of cord blood T cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were determined with microarrays， analyzed in a gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed by real-time quantitative PCRs.Results:Aneuploidy was more frequent in the zidovudine-exposed group (26.3%) than in the tenofovir-exposed group (14.2%) or in controls (13.3%; P < 0.05 for both). The transcription of genes involved in DNA repair， telomere maintenance， nucleotide metabolism， DNA/RNA synthesis， and the cell cycle was deregulated in samples from both the zidovudine and the tenofovir-exposed groups.Conclusion:Although tenofovir has a lower clastogenic impact than zidovudine， gene expression profiling showed that both drugs alter the transcription of DNA repair and telomere maintenance genes.
The differential characterization of GPR55 receptor in human peripheral blood reveals a distinctive expression in monocytes and NK cells and a proinflammatory role in these innate cells.,Int Immunol, 2015 Mar,25344934,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25344934/,G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) is activated by endogenous， plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids. Recent studies reported a broad tissue distribution for GPR55 and found prominent roles for this receptor in inflammatory pain， gut and bone physiology， as well as cancer. However， little is known about the expression and function of GPR55 in immune cells. To address this question， we performed a detailed characterization of GPR55 in different human innate and adaptive immune populations using polychromatic flow cytometry and we found that monocytes and NK cells expressed remarkable levels of this receptor compared to several cells of adaptive immunity. GPR55 activation by the specific agonist O-1602 boosted IL-12 and TNF-α production， and decreased endocytic activity， in LPS-activated monocytes. In addition， it increased CD69 activation marker expression， granzyme B and CD107a-dependent cytotoxicity and IFN-γ and TNF-α production in NK cells activated by both IL-2 and IL-12. These over-stimulatory effects of GPR55 were antagonized by its selective antagonist cannabidiol. Altogether， our data thus unveil a proinflammatory role for GPR55 in innate immunity that may be important for the design of new immune therapeutic strategies.Keywords:cannabinoid receptors; immunoregulation; innate immunity.
Overexpression of nucleotide metabolic enzyme DUT in hepatocellular carcinoma potentiates a therapeutic opportunity through targeting its dUTPase activity.,Cancer Lett, 2022 Nov 1,36075487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075487/,Uracil misincorporation during DNA replication is a major cell toxic event， of which cancer cells overcome by activating the dUTPase enzyme. The DUT gene is the only known dUTPase in human. Despite reports on common upregulations in cancers， the role of DUT in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely undetermined. In this study， we investigated the mechanism underlying DUT biology in HCC and tumor susceptibility to drug targeting dUTPase. Overexpression of DUT was found in 42% of HCC tumors and correlated with advanced stage HCC. Knockout of DUT in HCC cell lines showed suppressed proliferation through cell cycle arrest and a spontaneous induction of DNA damage. A protective effect from oxidative stress was also demonstrated in both knockout and overexpression DUT assays. Transcriptome analysis highlighted the NF-κB survival signaling as the downstream effector pathway of DUT in overriding oxidative stress-induced cell death. Interestingly， stably expressed DUT in liver progenitor organoids conferred drug resistance to TKI Sorafenib. Targeting dUTPase activity by TAS-114， could potentiate suppression of HCC growth that synergized with Sorafenib for better treatment sensitivity. In conclusion， upregulated DUT represents a nucleotide metabolic weakness and therapeutic opportunity in HCC.Keywords:DUT; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Targeted cancer therapy; dUTPase.

Antiadhesive natural products against uropathogenic E. coli: What can we learn from cranberry extract?,J Ethnopharmacol, 2020 Jul 15,32311481,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32311481/,Ethnopharmacological relevance:Extracts from Cranberry fruits (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are traditionally used against urinary tract infections， mainly due to antiadhesive activity against uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC)， but the exact mode of action and compounds， responsible for the activity， are unknown.Aim of the study:i. To investigate if cranberry extract acts only by a single component or must be assessed as a multi-active-compound preparation; ii to screen isolated cranberry-related natural products under in vitro conditions to pinpoint natural products with antiadhesive effects against UPEC， followed by in silico calculations (QSAR) to predict potential antiadhesive compounds; iii. investigations by using urine samples from cranberry treated volunteers for evaluation on the bacterial transcriptome and the mannose-binding side of FimH， iv. to investigate if besides Tamm Horsfall Protein induction in the kidney， the extract acts also directly against UPEC.Material and methods:Antiadhesive activity of 105 compounds was determined by flow cytometric adhesion assay (UPEC UTI89 on T24 bladder cells). Urine samples from 16 volunteers treated with cranberry extract (p.o.， 7 days， 900 mg/day) were used for ex vivo testing concerning influence on the bacterial transcriptome (Illumina RNA-seq) and interaction with the mannose binding domain of type-1 fimbriae.Results:i. The antiadhesive effect of cranberry extract cannot be attributed to a single compound or to a single fraction. ii. Unglycosylated flavones and flavonols with bulky substitution of the B ring contribute to the antiadhesive activity. 3'-8″-biflavones and flavolignans (not related to cranberry fruits) were identified as potent antiadhesive compounds against UPEC. iii. QSAR yielded a model with good statistical performance and sufficient internal and external predictive ability. iv. Urine samples from male cranberry-treated volunteers indicated significant interaction with the mannose binding domain of type-1 fimbriae， which correlated with the amount of Tamm-Horsfall Protein in the test samples. v Cranberry extract did not influence the UPEC transcriptome; gene expression of bacterial adhesins (P-， S-fimbrae， curli) was not influenced by the urine samples， while a slight， but non-significant upregulation of type 1 fimbriae was observed.Conclusions:B-ring substituted flavones and flavonols from cranberry contribute to the antiadhesive activity against UPEC by inhibition of the FimH-mediated interaction with the host cell bladder epithelium.Keywords:Adhesion; Cranberry; FimH; Uropathogenic E. coli; Vaccinium macrocarpon.
PARP inhibitors and radiation potentiate liver cell death in vitro. Do hepatocellular carcinomas have an achilles' heel?,Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol, 2021 Sep,33183998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33183998/,Background:A promising avenue for cancer treatment is exacerbating the deregulation of the DNA repair machinery that would normally protect the genome. To address the applicability of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) combined with radiotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) two approaches were used: firstly， the in vitro sensitivity to the PARPi Veliparib and Talazoparib +/- radiation exposure was determined in liver cell lines and the impact of the HBV X protein (HBx) that deregulates cellular DNA damage repair via SMC5/6 degradation was investigated. Secondly， PARP expression profiles and DNA damage levels using the surrogate marker gammaH2AX were assessed in a panel of control liver vs HCC tissues.Methods:Cell cytotoxicity was measured by clonogenic survival or relative cell growth and the DNA damage response using immunological-based techniques in Hep3B， PLC/PRF/5， HepG2- and HepaRG-derived models. Transcriptome changes due to HBx expression vs SMC6 loss were assessed by RNA sequencing in HepaRG-derived models. PARP and PARG transcripts (qPCR) and PARP1， H2AX and gammaH2AX protein levels (RPPA) were compared in control liver vs HBV-， HCV-， alcohol- and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC (tumor/peritumor) tissues.Results:PARPi cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced when combined with X-rays (2Gy) with Talazoparib having a greater impact than Veliparib in most in vitro models. HBx expression significantly lowered survival， probably driven by SMC5/6 loss based on the transcriptome analysis and higher DNA damage levels. PARP1 and PARP2 transcript levels were significantly higher in tumor than peritumor and control tissues. The HBV/HCV/alcohol-associated tumor tissues studied had reduced H2AX but higher gammaH2AX protein levels compared to peritumor and control tissues providing evidence of increased DNA damage during liver disease progression.Conclusions:These proof-of-concept experiments support PARPi alone or combined with radiotherapy for HCC treatment， particularly for HBV-associated tumors， that warrant further investigation.Keywords:DNA damage; Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein; Liver cancer; SMC5/6; Talazoparib; Veliparib.; gammaH2AX.

Discovering novel phenotype-selective neurotrophic factors to treat neurodegenerative diseases.,Prog Brain Res, 2004,14699964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14699964/,ocytes and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) interact functionally to mediate processes as diverse as neuroprotection， neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Moreover， the interaction can be homotypic， implying that astrocyte-derived secreted molecules affect their adjacent neurons optimally vs remote neurons. Astrocytes produce neurotrophic and extracellular matrix molecules that affect neuronal growth， development and survival， synaptic development， stabilization and functioning， and neurogenesis. This new knowledge offers the opportunity of developing astrocyte-derived， secreted proteins as a new class of therapeutics specifically to treat diseases of the CNS. However， primary astrocytes proliferate slowly in vitro， and when induced to immortalize by genetic manipulation， tend to lose their phenotype. These problems have limited the development of astrocytes as sources of potential drug candidates. We have successfully developed a method to induce spontaneous immortalization of astrocytes. Gene expression analysis， karyotyping and activity profiling data show that these spontaneously immortalized type-1 astrocyte cell lines retain the properties of their primary parents. The method is generic， such that cell lines can be prepared from any region of the CNS. To date， a library of 70 cell lines from four regions of the CNS: ventral mesencephalon， striatum， cerebral cortex and hippocampus， has been created. A phenotype-selective neurotrophic factor for dopaminergic neurons has been discovered from one of the cell lines (VMCL1). This mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a 20 kD， glycosylated， human secreted protein. Homologs of this protein have been identified in 16 other species including C. elegans. These new developments offer the opportunity of creating a library of astrocyte-derived molecules， and developing the ones with the best therapeutic indices for clinical use.

Network- and systems-based re-engineering of dendritic cells with non-coding RNAs for cancer immunotherapy.,Theranostics, 2021 Jan 1,33391542,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33391542/,Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that induce and regulate adaptive immunity by presenting antigens to T cells. Due to their coordinative role in adaptive immune responses， DCs have been used as cell-based therapeutic vaccination against cancer. The capacity of DCs to induce a therapeutic immune response can be enhanced by re-wiring of cellular signalling pathways with microRNAs (miRNAs).Methods:Since the activation and maturation of DCs is controlled by an interconnected signalling network， we deploy an approach that combines RNA sequencing data and systems biology methods to delineate miRNA-based strategies that enhance DC-elicited immune responses.Results:Through RNA sequencing of IKKβ-matured DCs that are currently being tested in a clinical trial on therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination， we identified 44 differentially expressed miRNAs. According to a network analysis， most of these miRNAs regulate targets that are linked to immune pathways， such as cytokine and interleukin signalling. We employed a network topology-oriented scoring model to rank the miRNAs， analysed their impact on immunogenic potency of DCs， and identified dozens of promising miRNA candidates， with miR-15a and miR-16 as the top ones. The results of our analysis are presented in a database that constitutes a tool to identify DC-relevant miRNA-gene interactions with therapeutic potential (https://www.synmirapy.net/dc-optimization).Conclusions:Our approach enables the systematic analysis and identification of functional miRNA-gene interactions that can be experimentally tested for improving DC immunogenic potency.Keywords:dendritic cell; microRNAs; network biology; systems biology; therapeutic vaccination in cancer.

The retinoblastoma protein selectively represses E2F1 targets via a TAAC DNA element during cellular senescence.,J Biol Chem, 2012 Oct 26,22955272,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22955272/,The retinoblastoma (Rb) protein mediates heterochromatin formation at the promoters of E2 transcription factor 1 (E2F1) target genes， such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin A2 (CCNA2)， and represses these genes during cellular senescence. However， the selectivity of Rb recruitment is still not well understood. Here， we demonstrate that a senescence-associated gene is a direct target of E2F1 and is also repressed by heterochromatin in senescent cells. In contrast， ARF and p27(KIP1)， which are also E2F1 targets， are not repressed by Rb and heterochromatin formation. By comparing the promoter sequences of these genes， we found a novel TAAC element that is present in the cellular senescence-inhibited gene， proliferating cell nuclear antigen， and CCNA2 promoters but absent from the ARF and p27(KIP1) promoters. This TAAC element associates with Rb and is required for Rb recruitment. We further determined that TAAC element-mediated Rb association requires the E2F1 binding site， but not E2F1 protein. These results provide a novel molecular mechanism for the different expression patterns of E2F1 targets and afford new mechanistic insight regarding the selectivity of Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene repression during cellular senescence.

Identification of genotype-correlated sensitivity to selective kinase inhibitors by using high-throughput tumor cell line profiling.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2007 Dec 11,18077425,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18077425/,Kinase inhibitors constitute an important new class of cancer drugs， whose selective efficacy is largely determined by underlying tumor cell genetics. We established a high-throughput platform to profile 500 cell lines derived from diverse epithelial cancers for sensitivity to 14 kinase inhibitors. Most inhibitors were ineffective against unselected cell lines but exhibited dramatic cell killing of small nonoverlapping subsets. Cells with exquisite sensitivity to EGFR， HER2， MET， or BRAF kinase inhibitors were marked by activating mutations or amplification of the drug target. Although most cell lines recapitulated known tumor-associated genotypes， the screen revealed low-frequency drug-sensitizing genotypes in tumor types not previously associated with drug susceptibility. Furthermore， comparing drugs thought to target the same kinase revealed striking differences， predictive of clinical efficacy. Genetically defined cancer subsets， irrespective of tissue type， predict response to kinase inhibitors， and provide an important preclinical model to guide early clinical applications of novel targeted inhibitors.

Sprouty-2 regulates HIV-specific T cell polyfunctionality.,J Clin Invest, 2014 Jan,24292711,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24292711/,The ability of individual T cells to perform multiple effector functions is crucial for protective immunity against viruses and cancer. This polyfunctionality is frequently lost during chronic infections; however， the molecular mechanisms driving T cell polyfunctionality are poorly understood. We found that human T cells stimulated by a high concentration of antigen lacked polyfunctionality and expressed a transcription profile similar to that of exhausted T cells. One specific pathway implicated by the transcription profile in control of T cell polyfunctionality was the MAPK/ERK pathway. This pathway was altered in response to different antigen concentrations， and polyfunctionality correlated with upregulation of phosphorylated ERK. T cells that were stimulated with a high concentration of antigen upregulated sprouty-2 (SPRY2)， a negative regulator of the MAPK/ERK pathway. The clinical relevance of SPRY2 was confirmed by examining SPRY2 expression in HIV-specific T cells， where high levels of SPRY2 were seen in HIV-specific T cells and inhibition of SPRY2 expression enhanced the HIV-specific polyfunctional response independently of the PD-1 pathway. Our findings indicate that increased SPRY2 expression during chronic viral infection reduces T cell polyfunctionality and identify SPRY2 as a potential target for immunotherapy.

Dynamic methylation of histone H3K18 in differentiating Theileria parasites.,Nat Commun, 2021 May 28,34050145,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34050145/,Lysine methylation on histone tails impacts genome regulation and cell fate determination in many developmental processes. Apicomplexa intracellular parasites cause major diseases and they have developed complex life cycles with fine-tuned differentiation events. Yet， apicomplexa genomes have few transcription factors and little is known about their epigenetic control systems. Tick-borne Theileria apicomplexa species have relatively small， compact genomes and a remarkable ability to transform leucocytes in their bovine hosts. Here we report enriched H3 lysine 18 monomethylation (H3K18me1) on the gene bodies of repressed genes in Theileria macroschizonts. Differentiation to merozoites (merogony) leads to decreased H3K18me1 in parasite nuclei. Pharmacological manipulation of H3K18 acetylation or methylation impacted parasite differentiation and expression of stage-specific genes. Finally， we identify a parasite SET-domain methyltransferase (TaSETup1) that can methylate H3K18 and represses gene expression. Thus， H3K18me1 emerges as an important epigenetic mark which controls gene expression and stage differentiation in Theileria parasites.

Downregulation of long noncoding RNA TP73-AS1 expression confers resistance to temozolomide in human glioblastoma cells.,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids, 2024,37452786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37452786/,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)， the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor， is resistant to conventional radiotherapies and chemotherapies， including temozolomide (TMZ). Overcoming GBM resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent TMZ poses an important therapeutic problem. This study established an association between the long noncoding RNATP73-AS1and TMZ sensitivity regulation in human GBM cells (U87MG). Transcriptomic analysis revealed thatTP73-AS1expression was reduced in TMZ-resistant U87MGRT100cells compared to that in parental U87MG cells. Additionally，TP73-AS1knockdown in parental U87MG cells decreased their sensitivity to TMZ. Overall， these findings suggest thatTP73-AS1functions as a regulator of TMZ sensitivity in GBM cells.Keywords:Drug resistance; TP73-AS1; glioblastoma; long noncoding RNA; temozolomide.
Epigenetic profiling of multidrug-resistant human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells reveals novel hyper- and hypomethylated targets.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2007 Mar,17363502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17363502/,The successful treatment of cancer requires a clear understanding of multiple interacting factors involved in the development of drug resistance. Presently， two hypotheses， genetic and epigenetic， have been proposed to explain mechanisms of acquired cancer drug resistance. In the present study， we examined the alterations in epigenetic mechanisms in the drug-resistant MCF-7 human breast cancer cells induced by doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (cisDDP)， two chemotherapeutic drugs with different modes of action. Despite this difference， both of the drug-resistant cell lines displayed similar pronounced changes in the global epigenetic landscape showing loss of global DNA methylation， loss of histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation， increased phosporylation of histone H3 serine 10， and diminished expression of Suv4-20h2 histone methyltransferase compared with parental MCF-7 cells. In addition to global epigenetic changes， the MCF-7/DOX and MCF-7/cisDDP drug-resistant cells are characterized by extensive alterations in region-specific DNA methylation， as indicated by the appearance of the number of differentially methylated DNA genes. A detailed analysis of hypo- and hypermethylated DNA sequences revealed that the acquisition of drug-resistant phenotype of MCF-7 cells to DOX and cisDDP， in addition to specific alterations induced by a particular drug only， was characterized by three major common mechanisms: dysfunction of genes involved in estrogen metabolism (sulfatase 2 and estrogen receptor alpha)， apoptosis (p73， alpha-tubulin， BCL2-antagonist of cell death， tissue transglutaminase 2 and forkhead box protein K1)， and cell-cell contact (leptin， stromal cell-derived factor receptor 1， activin A receptor E-cadherin) and showed that two opposing hypo- and hypermethylation processes may enhance and complement each other in the disruption of these pathways. These results provided evidence that epigenetic changes are an important feature of cancer cells with acquired drug-resistant phenotype and may be a crucial contributing factor to its development. Finally， deregulation of similar pathways may explain the existence and provide mechanism of cross-resistance of cancer cells to different types of chemotherapeutic agents.
Hypoxia-driven immunosuppression by Treg and type-2 conventional dendritic cells in HCC.,Hepatology, 2022 Nov,35184329,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184329/,Background and aims:Hypoxia is one of the central players in shaping the immune context of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However， the complex interplay between immune cell infiltrates within the hypoxic TME of HCC remains to be elucidated.Approach and results:We analyzed the immune landscapes of hypoxia-low and hypoxia-high tumor regions using cytometry by time of light， immunohistochemistry， and transcriptomic analyses. The mechanisms of immunosuppression in immune subsets of interest were further explored using in vitro hypoxia assays. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and a number of immunosuppressive myeloid subsets， including M2 macrophages and human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DRlo) type 2 conventional dendritic cell (cDC2)， were found to be significantly enriched in hypoxia-high tumor regions. On the other hand， the abundance of active granzyme BhiPD-1loCD8+T cells in hypoxia-low tumor regions implied a relatively active immune landscape compared with hypoxia-high regions. The up-regulation of cancer-associated genes in the tumor tissues and immunosuppressive genes in the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes supported a highly pro-tumorigenic network in hypoxic HCC. Chemokine genes such as CCL20 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 20) and CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5) were associated with recruitment of both Tregs and HLA-DRlocDC2 to hypoxia-high microenvironments. The interaction between Tregs and cDC2 under a hypoxic TME resulted in a loss of antigen-presenting HLA-DR on cDC2.Conclusions:We uncovered the unique immunosuppressive landscapes and identified key immune subsets enriched in hypoxic HCC. In particular， we identified a potential Treg-mediated immunosuppression through interaction with a cDC2 subset in HCC that could be exploited for immunotherapies.
Induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress is associated with the anti-tumor activity of monepantel across cancer types.,Cancer Med, 2023 Jun,37148543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37148543/,Background:Monepantel is an anti-helminthic drug that also has anti-cancer properties. Despite several studies over the years， the molecular target of monepantel in mammalian cells is still unknown， and its mechanism-of-action is not fully understood， though effects on cell cycle， mTOR signalling and autophagy have been implicated.Methods:Viability assays were performed on >20 solid cancer cell cells， and apoptosis assays were performed on a subset of these， including 3D cultures. Genetic deletion of BAX/BAK and ATG were used to establish roles of apoptosis and autophagy in killing activity. RNA-sequencing was performed on four cell lines after monepantel treatment， and differentially regulated genes were confirmed by Western blotting.Results:We showed that monepantel has anti-proliferative activity on a broad range of cancer cell lines. In some， this was associated with induction of apoptosis which was confirmed using a BAX/BAK-deficient cell line. However， proliferation is still inhibited in these cells following monepantel treatment， indicating cell-cycle disruption as the major anti-cancer effect. Previous studies have also indicated autophagic cell death occurs following monepantel treatment. We showed autophagy induction in multiple cell lines; however， deletion of a key autophagy regulator ATG7 had minimal impact on monepantel's anti-proliferative activity， suggesting autophagy is associated with， but not required for its anti-tumour effects. Transcriptomic analysis of four cell lines treated with monepantel revealed downregulation of many genes involved in the cell cycle， and upregulation of genes linked to ATF4-mediated ER stress responses， especially those involved in amino-acid metabolism and protein synthesis.Conclusions:As these outcomes are all associated with mTOR signalling， cell cycle and autophagy， we now provide a likely triggering mechanism for the anti-cancer activity of monepantel.Keywords:ER stress; autophagy; cell cycle; mTOR; monepantel.
Celecoxib Suppresses NF-kappaB p65 (RelA) and TNFalpha Expression Signaling in Glioblastoma.,J Clin Med, 2023 Oct 23,37892820,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37892820/,Background:Glioblastoma (GBM) harbors significant genetic heterogeneity， high infiltrative capacity， and patterns of relapse following many therapies. The expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB p65 (RelA)) and signaling pathways is constitutively activated in GBM through inflammatory stimulation such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)， cell invasion， motility， abnormal physiological stimuli， and inducible chemoresistance. However， the underlying anti-tumor and anti-proliferative mechanisms of NF-κB p65 (RelA) and TNFα are still poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiling of NF-κB p65 (RelA) and TNFα as well as the effectiveness of celecoxib along with temozolomide (TMZ) in reducing the growth of the human GBM cell line SF-767.Methods:genome-wide expression profiling， enrichment analysis， immune infiltration， quantitative expression， and the Microculture Tetrazolium Test (MTT) proliferation assay were performed to appraise the effects of celecoxib and TMZ.Results:demonstrated the upregulation of NF-κB p65 (RelA) and TNFα and celecoxib reduced the viability of the human glioblastoma cell line SF-767， cell proliferation， and NF-κB p65 (RelA) and TNFα expression in a dose-dependent manner. Overall， these findings demonstrate for the first time how celecoxib therapy could mitigate the invasive characteristics of the human GBM cell line SF-767 by inhibiting the NF-κB mediated stimulation of the inflammatory cascade.Conclusion:based on current findings， we propose that celecoxib as a drug candidate in combination with temozolomide might dampen the transcriptional and enzymatic activities associated with the aggressiveness of GBM and reduce the expression of GBM-associated NF-κB p65 (RelA) and TNFα inflammatory genes expression.Keywords:celecoxib; gene expression genes; glioblastoma; survival analysis; temozolomide; tumor necrosis factor.
Pharmacotranscriptomic Analysis Reveals Novel Drugs and Gene Networks Regulating Ferroptosis in Cancer.,Cancers (Basel), 2020 Nov 5,33167414,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33167414/,(1) Background: Ferroptosis is an apoptosis-independent cell death program implicated in many diseases including cancer. Emerging evidence suggests ferroptosis as a promising avenue for cancer therapy， but the paucity of mechanistic understanding of ferroptosis regulation and lack of biomarkers for sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers have significantly hampered the utility of ferroptosis-based therapy. (2) Methods: We performed integrated dataset analysis by correlating the sensitivity of small-molecule compounds (n= 481) against the transcriptomes of solid cancer cell lines (n= 659) to identify drug candidates with the potential to induce ferroptosis. Generalizable gene signatures of ferroptosis sensitivity and resistance are defined by interrogating drug effects of ferroptosis inducers (n= 7) with transcriptomic data of pan-solid cancer cells. (3) Results: We report， for the first time， the comprehensive identification of drug compounds that induce ferroptosis and the delineation of generalizable gene signatures of pro- and anti-ferroptosis in pan-cancer. We further reveal that small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2)-mutant brain tumors show enrichment of pro-ferroptosis gene signature， suggesting a unique vulnerability of SCLC andIDH-mutant tumors to ferroptosis inducers. Finally， we demonstrate that targeting class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) significantly enhances ferroptotic cell death caused by Erastin， an ferroptosis inducer， in lung cancer cells， revealing a previously underappreciated role for HDAC in ferroptosis regulation. (4) Conclusions: Our work reveals novel drug compounds and gene networks that regulate ferroptosis in cancer， which sheds light on the mechanisms of ferroptosis and may facilitate biomarker-guided stratification for ferroptosis-based therapy.Keywords:HDAC; IDH mutation; ferroptosis; ferroptosis-based therapy; gene signature; pharmacotranscriptomics; precision oncology; small-cell lung cancer.
A distinct innate lymphoid cell population regulates tumor-associated T cells.,Nat Med, 2017 Mar,28165478,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28165478/,ntitumor T cells are subject to multiple mechanisms of negative regulation. Recent findings that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) regulate adaptive T cell responses led us to examine the regulatory potential of ILCs in the context of cancer. We identified a unique ILC population that inhibits tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from high-grade serous tumors， defined their suppressive capacity in vitro， and performed a comprehensive analysis of their phenotype. Notably， the presence of this CD56+CD3-population in TIL cultures was associated with reduced T cell numbers， and further functional studies demonstrated that this population suppressed TIL expansion and altered TIL cytokine production. Transcriptome analysis and phenotypic characterization determined that regulatory CD56+CD3-cells exhibit low cytotoxic activity， produce IL-22， and have an expression profile that overlaps with those of natural killer (NK) cells and other ILCs. NKp46 was highly expressed by these cells， and addition of anti-NKp46 antibodies to TIL cultures abrogated the ability of these regulatory ILCs to suppress T cell expansion. Notably， the presence of these regulatory ILCs in TIL cultures corresponded with a striking reduction in the time to disease recurrence. These studies demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized ILC population regulates the activity and expansion of tumor-associated T cells.
Dihydrotanshinone I Enhances Cell Adhesion and Inhibits Cell Migration in Osteosarcoma U-2 OS Cells through CD44 and Chemokine Signaling.,Molecules, 2022 Jun 9,35744840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35744840/,In the screening of novel natural products against cancer using an in vitro cancer cell model， we recently found that tanshinones from a traditional Chinese medicine， the rhizome ofSalvia miltiorrhizaBunge (Danshen)， had potent effects on cell proliferation and migration. Especially for human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells， tanshinones significantly enhanced the cell adherence， implying a possible role in cell adhesion and cell migration inhibition. In this work， therefore， we aimed to provide a new insight into the possible molecule mechanisms of dihydrotanshinone I， which had the strongest effects on cell adhesion among several candidate tanshinones. RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis and several biochemical experiments indicated that there were comprehensive signals involved in dihydrotanshinone I-treated U-2 OS cells， such as cell cycle， DNA replication， thermogenesis， tight junction， oxidative phosphorylation， adherens junction， and focal adhesion. First， dihydrotanshinone I could potently inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by downregulating the expression ofCDK4，CDK2，cyclin D1， and cyclin E1 and upregulating the expression of p21. Second， it could significantly enhance cell adhesion on cell plates and inhibit cell migration， involving the hyaluronan CD44-mediated CXCL8-PI3K/AKT-FOXO1， IL6-STAT3-P53， and EMT signaling pathways. Thus， the increased expression of CD44 and lengthened protrusions around the cell yielded a significant increase in cell adhesion. In summary， these results suggest that dihydrotanshinone I might be an interesting molecular therapy for enhancing human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cell adhesion and inhibiting cell migration and proliferation.Keywords:CD44; Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen); cell adhesion; cell migration; dihydrotanshinone I; osteosarcoma.
Transcriptomic interplay between Acinetobacter baumannii ， human macrophage and polymyxin.,bioRxiv [Preprint], 2024 Jan 23,38328180,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38328180/,Optimization of antibiotic therapy has been hindered by our dearth of understanding on the mechanism of the host-pathogen-drug interactions. Here， we employed dual RNA-sequencing to examine transcriptomic perturbations in response to polymyxin B in a co-culture infection model ofAcinetobacter baumanniiand human macrophages. Our findings revealed that polymyxin B treatment induced significant transcriptomic response in macrophage-interactingA. baumannii， exacerbating bacterial oxidative stress， disrupting metal homeostasis， affecting osmoadaptation， triggering stringent stress response， and influencing pathogenic factors. Moreover， infected macrophages adapt heme catabolism， coagulation cascade， and hypoxia-inducible signaling to confront bacterial invasion. DisruptingrcnB，ompW， andtraR/dksAgenes inA. baumanniiimpairs metal homeostasis， osmotic stress defense and stringent responses， thereby enhancing antibacterial killing by polymyxin. These findings shed light on the global stress adaptations at the network level during host-pathogen-drug interactions， revealing promising therapeutic targets for further investigation.Importance:In the context of the development of bacterial resistance during the course of antibiotic therapy， the role of macrophages in shaping bacterial response to antibiotic killing remains enigmatic. Herein we employed dual RNA-sequencing and anin vitrotripartite model to delve into the unexplored transcriptional networks of theAcinetobacter baumannii-macrophage-polymyxin axis. Our findings uncovered the potential synergy between macrophages and polymyxin B which appear to act in co-operation to disrupt multiple stress tolerance mechanisms inA. baumannii. Notably， we discovered the critical roles of bacterial nickel/cobalt homeostasis (rcnBfamily)， osmotic stress defense (ompWfamily)， and stringent response regulator (traR/dksAC4-type zinc finger) in tolerating the last-line antibiotic polymyxin B. Our findings may lead to potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics against the problematic pathogenA. baumannii.
Marked Global DNA Hypomethylation Is Associated with Constitutive PD-L1 Expression in Melanoma.,iScience, 2018 Jun 29,30240750,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30240750/,Constitutive expression of the immune checkpoint， PD-L1， inhibits anti-tumor immune responses in cancer， although the factors involved in PD-L1 regulation are poorly understood. Here we show that loss of global DNA methylation， particularly in intergenic regions and repeat elements， is associated with constitutive (PD-L1CON)， versus inducible (PD-L1IND)， PD-L1 expression in melanoma cell lines. We further show this is accompanied by transcriptomic up-regulation. De novo epigenetic regulators (e.g.， DNMT3A) are strongly correlated with PD-L1 expression and methylome status. Accordingly， decitabine-mediated inhibition of global methylation in melanoma cells leads to increased PD-L1 expression. Moreover， viral mimicry and immune response genes are highly expressed in lymphocyte-negative plus PD-L1-positive melanomas， versus PD-L1-negative melanomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In summary， using integrated genomic analysis we identified that global DNA methylation influences PD-L1 expression in melanoma， and hence melanoma's ability to evade anti-tumor immune responses. These results have implications for combining epigenetic therapy with immunotherapy.Keywords:Cancer; Genetics; Genomics; Transcriptomics.
Integrative radiogenomic profiling of squamous cell lung cancer.,Cancer Res, 2013 Oct 15,23980093,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23980093/,Radiotherapy is one of the mainstays of anticancer treatment， but the relationship between the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and their genomic characteristics is still not well defined. Here， we report the development of a high-throughput platform for measuring radiation survival in vitro and its validation in comparison with conventional clonogenic radiation survival analysis. We combined results from this high-throughput assay with genomic parameters in cell lines from squamous cell lung carcinoma， which is standardly treated by radiotherapy， to identify parameters that predict radiation sensitivity. We showed that activation of NFE2L2， a frequent event in lung squamous cancers， confers radiation resistance. An expression-based， in silico screen nominated inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as NFE2L2 antagonists. We showed that the selective PI3K inhibitor， NVP-BKM120， both decreased NRF2 protein levels and sensitized NFE2L2 or KEAP1-mutant cells to radiation. We then combined results from this high-throughput assay with single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of gene expression data. The resulting analysis identified pathways implicated in cell survival， genotoxic stress， detoxification， and innate and adaptive immunity as key correlates of radiation sensitivity. The integrative and high-throughput methods shown here for large-scale profiling of radiation survival and genomic features of solid-tumor-derived cell lines should facilitate tumor radiogenomics and the discovery of genotype-selective radiation sensitizers and protective agents.
Managing the sequence-specificity of antisense oligonucleotides in drug discovery.,Nucleic Acids Res, 2017 Mar 17,28426096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28426096/,ll drugs perturb the expression of many genes in the cells that are exposed to them. These gene expression changes can be divided into effects resulting from engaging the intended target and effects resulting from engaging unintended targets. For antisense oligonucleotides， developments in bioinformatics algorithms， and the quality of sequence databases， allow oligonucleotide sequences to be analyzed computationally， in terms of the predictability of their interactions with intended and unintended RNA targets. Applying these tools enables selection of sequence-specific oligonucleotides where no- or only few unintended RNA targets are expected. To evaluate oligonucleotide sequence-specificity experimentally， we recommend a transcriptomics protocol where two or more oligonucleotides targeting the same RNA molecule， but with entirely different sequences， are evaluated together. This helps to clarify which changes in cellular RNA levels result from downstream processes of engaging the intended target， and which are likely to be related to engaging unintended targets. As required for all classes of drugs， the toxic potential of oligonucleotides must be evaluated in cell- and animal models before clinical testing. Since potential adverse effects related to unintended targeting are sequence-dependent and therefore species-specific， in vitro toxicology assays in human cells are especially relevant in oligonucleotide drug discovery.
Atypical phosphatase DUSP11 inhibition promotes nc886 expression and potentiates gemcitabine-mediated cell death through NF-kB modulation.,Cancer Gene Ther, 2024 Sep,39048662,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39048662/,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the deadliest cancers among all solid tumors. First-line treatment relies on gemcitabine (Gem) and despite treatment improvements， refractoriness remains a universal challenge. Attempts to decipher how feedback-loops control signaling pathways towards drug resistance have gained attention in recent years， particularly focused on the role of phosphatases. In this study， a CRISPR/Cas9-based phenotypic screen was performed to identify members from the dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP) family potentially acting on Gem response in PDAC cells. The approach revealed the atypical RNA phosphatase DUSP11 as a potential target， whose inhibition creates vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. DUSP11 genetic inhibition impaired cell survival and promoted apoptosis， synergistically enhancing Gem cytotoxicity. In silico transcriptome analysis of RNA-seq data from PDAC human samples identified NF-ĸB signaling pathway highly correlated with DUSP11 upregulation. Consistently， Gem-induced NF-ĸB phosphorylation was blocked upon DUSP11 inhibition in vitro. Mechanistically， we found that DUSP11 directly impacts nc886 expression and modulates PKR-NF-ĸB signaling cascade after Gem exposure in PDAC cells resulting in resistance to Gem-induced cell death. In conclusion， this study provides new insights on DUSP11 role in RNA biology and Gem response in PDAC cells.
Augmented drug resistance of osteosarcoma cells within decalcified bone matrix scaffold: The role of glutamine metabolism.,Int J Cancer, 2024 May 1,38196144,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38196144/,Due to the lack of a precise in vitro model that can mimic the nature microenvironment in osteosarcoma， the understanding of its resistance to chemical drugs remains limited. Here， we report a novel three-dimensional model of osteosarcoma constructed by seeding tumor cells (MG-63 and MNNG/HOS Cl no. 5) within demineralized bone matrix scaffolds. Demineralized bone matrix scaffolds retain the original components of the natural bone matrix (hydroxyapatite and collagen type I)， and possess good biocompatibility allowing osteosarcoma cells to proliferate and aggregate into clusters within the pores. Growing within the scaffold conferred elevated resistance to doxorubicin on MG-63 and MNNG/HOS Cl no. 5 cell lines as compared to two-dimensional cultures. Transcriptomic analysis showed an increased enrichment for drug resistance genes along with enhanced glutamine metabolism in osteosarcoma cells in demineralized bone matrix scaffolds. Inhibition of glutamine metabolism resulted in a decrease in drug resistance of osteosarcoma， which could be restored by α-ketoglutarate supplementation. Overall， our study suggests that microenvironmental cues in demineralized bone matrix scaffolds can enhance osteosarcoma drug responses and that targeting glutamine metabolism may be a strategy for treating osteosarcoma drug resistance.Keywords:decalcified bone matrix; drug resistance; glutamine metabolism; osteosarcoma.
The diverse pancreatic tumor cell-intrinsic response to IFNγ is determined by epigenetic heterogeneity.,Cancer Lett, 2023 May 28,37023939,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37023939/,IFNγ signaling is mainly mediated through the activation of the canonical JAK-STAT signaling pathway， transcription factors， and epigenetic modifications. The activation of IFNγ signaling pathway may provide a novel option for tumor immunotherapy， but the outcomes remain controversial. In fact， recent studies suggest that the resistance to IFNγ-dependent immunotherapies is commonly derived from the tumor cell-intrinsic heterogeneity， the molecular mechanism of which remains elusive. Therefore， elucidating the tumor cell-intrinsic heterogeneity in response to IFNγ would be beneficial to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here， we first delineated the epigenetic redistribution and transcriptome alteration in response to IFNγ stimulation， and demonstrated that ectopic gain of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac at the promoter region mainly contributed to the enhancement of IFNγ-mediated transcriptional activity of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore， we found that the cellular heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in response to IFNγ was mainly attributed to cell-intrinsic H3K27me3 levels. Enhancement of H3K27me3 by GSK-J4 limited PD-L1hitumor growth by salvaging the intratumoral cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells， which may provide therapeutic strategies to overcome immune escape and resistance to IFNγ-based immunotherapies in pancreatic cancer.Keywords:Cellular heterogeneity; Epigenetic regulation; IFNγ; PD-L1; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
miR-34a is an intracellular and exosomal predictive biomarker for response to docetaxel with clinical relevance to prostate cancer progression.,Prostate, 2014 Sep,25053345,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25053345/,Background:Docetaxel-resistance limits successful treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer. We previously demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (exosomes) may play a role in regulating docetaxel resistance. Here， we investigated intracellular and extracellular (exosomal) miRNAs related to docetaxel resistance.Methods:Following global miRNA profiling of cell line models of docetaxel-resistance and their corresponding exosomes， we investigated the clinical relevance of four selected miRNAs (miR-598， miR-34a， miR-146a， miR-148a) in four publically available clinical cohorts representing both primary and advanced disease in tissue and urine specimens. One of these miRNAs， miR-34a was selected for functional evaluation by miRNA inhibition and over-expression in vitro. We further assessed the panel of miRNAs for their combined clinical relevance as a biomarker signature by examining their common predicted targets.Results:A strong correlation was found between the detection of miRNAs in exosomes and their corresponding cells of origin. Of the miRNAs chosen for further validation and clinical assessment， decreased miR-34a levels showed substantial clinical relevance and so was chosen for further analysis. Manipulating miR-34a in prostate cancer cells confirms that this miRNA regulates BCL-2 and may， in part， regulate response to docetaxel. When combined， these miRNAs are predicted to regulate a range of common mRNA targets， two of which (e.g.， SNCA， SCL7A5) demonstrate a strong relationship with prostate cancer progression and poor prognosis.Conclusions:This study supports the extracellular environment as an important source of minimally invasive predictive biomarkers representing their cellular origin. Using miR-34a as example， we showed that biomarkers identified in this manner may also hold functional relevance.Keywords:BCL-2; biomarkers; docetaxel-resistance; exosomes; miR-34a; microRNA; prostate cancer.
KANK1 regulates paclitaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.,Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol, 2020 Dec,32064933,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32064933/,Paclitaxel (PTX)， a tubulin-binding agent， is widely used and has shown good efficacy in the initial period of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However， the relatively rapid acquisition of resistance to PTX treatments that is observed in virtually all cases significantly limits its utility and remains a substantial challenge to the clinical management of NSCLC. The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes and mechanisms that might mediate acquired paclitaxel resistance. In this work， we established paclitaxel-resistant cells (A549-T) from parental cell lines by step-dose selectionin vitro. Using methylation chip analysis and transcriptome sequencing， 43，426 differentially methylated genes and 2，870 differentially expressed genes are identified. Six genes (KANK1，ALDH3A1，GALNT14，PIK3R3，LRG1，WEE2)， which may be related to paclitaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma， were identified. Among these genes，KANK1exhibited significant differences in methylation and expression between cell lines. SinceKANK1plays an important role in the development of renal cancer and gastric cancer， we hypothesised that it may also play a role in acquired resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Transient transfection of SiKANK1significantly reduced the expression ofKANK1， reducing apoptosis， increasing cell migration， and enhancing the tolerance of A549 cells to paclitaxel.KANK1acts as a tumour suppressor gene， mediating the resistance of lung adenocarcinoma A549 to paclitaxel. The reduction ofKANK1expression can increase the paclitaxel resistance of non-small cell lung cancer and increase the difficulty of clinical treatment.Keywords:KANK1; Lung adenocarcinoma; Molecular target therapy; methylation chip analysis; paclitaxel resistance; transcriptome sequencing.
Cancer Cells Haploinsufficient for ATM Are Sensitized to PARP Inhibitors by MET Inhibition.,Int J Mol Sci, 2022 May 21,35628590,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35628590/,TheMEToncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor. Its activation protects cells from death but also stimulates DNA damage response by triggering excess replicative stress. Transcriptomic classification of cancer cell lines based onMETexpression showed that response to the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib is poorer inMEToverexpressing cell lines. Accordingly， a highMETexpressing lung carcinoma cell line was sensitized to PARPi byMETTK inhibition. This was not linked solely toMEToverexpression: otherMEToverexpressing cell lines were biochemically but not functionally responsive to combined inhibition. Moreover， exogenously inducedMEToverexpression was unable to induce resistance to PARPi. TheMEToverexpressing cell line， responsive to the combined PARP andMETinhibition， carried a heterozygous mutation of the ATM gene and showed an attenuated response of ATM to PARPi. Among the downstream targets of ATM activation， NuMA was phosphorylated only in response to the combined PARP andMETinhibition. Given the role played by NuMA in mitosis， data show that the latter is affected byMETand PARP inhibition in cells with haploinsufficient ATM. This is important as ATM heterozygous mutation is frequently found in human cancer and in lung carcinomas in particular.Keywords:ATM; MET; PARP inhibitor; ovarian cancer; resistance.
Targeting glutamine metabolism and the focal adhesion kinase additively inhibits the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway in spheroid cancer stem-like properties of ovarian clear cell carcinoma in vitro.,Int J Oncol, 2017 Apr,28259988,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28259988/,Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world， which is linked to its resistance to chemotherapy. Strategies to overcome chemoresistance have been keenly investigated. Culturing cancer cells in suspension， which results in formation of spheroids， is a more accurate reflection of clinical cancer behavior in vitro than conventional adherent cultures. By performing RNA-seq analysis， we found that the focal adhesion pathway was essential in spheroids. The phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was increased in spheroids compared to adherent cells， and inhibition of FAK in spheroids resulted in inhibition of the downstream mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in ovarian clear cell carcinomas. This result also suggested that only using a FAK inhibitor might have limitations because the phosphorylation level of FAK could not be reduced to the level in adherent cells， and it appeared that some combination therapies might be necessary. We previously reported that glutamine and glutamate concentrations were higher in spheroids than adherent cells， and we investigated a synergistic effect targeting glutamine metabolism with FAK inhibition on the mTOR pathway. The combination of AOA， a pan-transaminase inhibitor， and PF 573228， a FAK inhibitor， additively inhibited the mTOR pathway in spheroids from ovarian clear cell carcinomas. Our in vitro study proposed a rationale for the positive and negative effects of using FAK inhibitors in ovarian clear cell carcinomas and suggested that targeting glutamine metabolism could overcome the limitation of FAK inhibitors by additively inhibiting the mTOR pathway.
Drug Resistance in Medulloblastoma Is Driven by YB-1， ABCB1 and a Seven-Gene Drug Signature.,Cancers (Basel), 2023 Feb 8,36831428,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36831428/,Therapy resistance represents an unmet challenge in the treatment of medulloblastoma. Accordingly， the identification of targets that mark drug-resistant cell populations， or drive the proliferation of resistant cells， may improve treatment strategies. To address this， we undertook a targeted approach focused on the multi-functional transcription factor YB-1. Genetic knockdown of YB-1 in Group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines diminished cell invasion in 3D in vitro assays and increased sensitivity to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic vincristine and anti-cancer agents panobinostat and JQ1. For vincristine， this occurred in part by YB-1-mediated transcriptional regulation of multi-drug resistance geneABCB1， as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Whole transcriptome sequencing of YB-1 knockdown cells identified a role for YB-1 in the regulation of tumourigenic processes， including lipid metabolism， cell death and survival and MYC and mTOR pathways. Stable cisplatin- and vincristine-tolerant Group 3 and SHH cell lines were generated to identify additional mechanisms driving resistance to standard-of-care medulloblastoma therapy. Next-generation sequencing revealed a vastly different transcriptomic landscape following chronic drug exposure， including a drug-tolerant seven-gene expression signature， common to all sequenced drug-tolerant cell lines， representing therapeutically targetable genes implicated in the acquisition of drug tolerance. Our findings provide significant insight into mechanisms and genes underlying therapy resistance in medulloblastoma.Keywords:ABC transporter; YB-1; cancer cell invasion; drug resistance; medulloblastoma; metastasis; vincristine.
Oleil Hydroxytyrosol (HTOL) Exerts Anti-Myeloma Activity by Antagonizing Key Survival Pathways in Malignant Plasma Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2021 Oct 28,34769070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34769070/,Polyphenols from olive oil are endowed with several biological activities. Chemical modifications have been recently applied to these compounds to improve their therapeutic activity in different pathological settings， including cancer. Herein， we describe the in vitro effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells of oleil hydroxytyrosol (HTOL)， a synthetic fatty ester of natural hydroxytyrosol with oleic acid. HTOL reduced the viability of various human MM cell lines (HMCLs)， even when co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells， triggering ER stress， UPR and apoptosis， while it was not cytotoxic against healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells or B lymphocytes. Whole-transcriptome profiling of HTOL-treated MM cells， coupled with protein expression analyses， indicate that HTOL antagonizes key survival pathways for malignant plasma cells， including the undruggable IRF4-c-MYC oncogenic axis. Accordingly， c-MYC gain- and loss-of-function strategies demonstrate that HTOL anti-tumor activity was， at least in part， due to c-MYC targeting. Taken together， these findings underscore the anti-MM potential of HTOL， providing the molecular framework for further investigation of HTOL-based treatments as novel anti-cancer agents.Keywords:experimental therapeutics; multiple myeloma; natural anti-tumor agents; oleil hydroxytyrosol.
CD40L membrane retention enhances the immunostimulatory effects of CD40 ligation.,Sci Rep, 2020 Jan 15,31941968,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31941968/,In carcinomas， the nature of CD40 ligand shapes the outcome of CD40 ligation. To date， the consequences of membrane-bound CD40L (mCD40L) on its immune-stimulatory function are unknown. Here， we examined the impact of mCD40L versus soluble CD40L (sCD40L) on T24 bladder carcinoma gene expression profiling. Of 410 differentially expressed genes， 286 were upregulated and 124 downregulated by mCD40L versus sCD40L. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed immune-stimulatory function as the most significant enriched biological process affected by upregulated transcripts， while those downregulated were critical for cell growth and division. Furthermore， immature dendritic cells (iDC) responded to mCD40L with enhanced maturation and activation over sCD40L evidenced by higher expression levels of CD83， CD86， HLA-DR and CD54， increased secretion of IL12 and IL10 and higher tumour-antigen (TA) uptake capacity. Furthermore， autologus CD3+ T cells responded to TA-loaded mCD40L-activated DC with increased proliferation and cytotoxic response (CD107a and IFN-γ-producing CD3+ CD8+ T cells) to the tumour-loaded autologous PBMCs compared to sCD40L. Thus， these data indicate that mCD40L enhances the immunostimulatory capacity over sCD40L. Furthermore， the ability of mCD40L to also directly induce cell death in CD40-expressing carcinomas， subsequently releasing tumour-specific antigens into the tumour microenvironment highlights the potential for mCD40L as a multi-faceted anti-cancer immunotherapeutic.
Reciprocal epigenetic remodeling controls testicular cancer hypersensitivity to hypomethylating agents and chemotherapy.,Mol Oncol, 2022 Feb,34482638,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34482638/,Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are aggressive but sensitive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Alternative therapies are needed for tumors refractory to cisplatin with hypomethylating agents providing one possibility. The mechanisms of cisplatin hypersensitivity and resistance in TGCTs remain poorly understood. Recently， it has been shown that TGCTs， even those resistant to cisplatin， are hypersensitive to very low doses of hypomethylating agents including 5-aza deoxy-cytosine (5-aza) and guadecitabine. We undertook a pharmacogenomic approach in order to better understand mechanisms of TGCT hypomethylating agent hypersensitivity by generating a panel of acquired 5-aza-resistant TGCT cells and contrasting these to previously generated acquired isogenic cisplatin-resistant cells from the same parent. Interestingly， there was a reciprocal relationship between cisplatin and 5-aza sensitivity， with cisplatin resistance associated with increased sensitivity to 5-aza and 5-aza resistance associated with increased sensitivity to cisplatin. Unbiased transcriptome analysis revealed 5-aza-resistant cells strongly downregulated polycomb target gene expression， the exact opposite of the finding for cisplatin-resistant cells， which upregulated polycomb target genes. This was associated with a dramatic increase in H3K27me3 and decrease in DNMT3B levels in 5-aza-resistant cells， the exact opposite changes seen in cisplatin-resistant cells. Evidence is presented that reciprocal regulation of polycomb and DNMT3B may be initiated by changes in DNMT3B levels as DNMT3B knockdown alone in parental cells resulted in increased expression of H3K27me3， EZH2， and BMI1， conferred 5-aza resistance and cisplatin sensitization， and mediated genome-wide repression of polycomb target gene expression. Finally， genome-wide analysis revealed that 5-aza-resistant， cisplatin-resistant， and DNMT3B-knockdown cells alter the expression of a common set of polycomb target genes. This study highlights that reciprocal epigenetic changes mediated by DNMT3B and polycomb may be a key driver of the unique cisplatin and 5-aza hypersensitivity of TGCTs and suggests that distinct epigenetic vulnerabilities may exist for pharmacological targeting of TGCTs.Keywords:5-aza deoxycytidine; DNA methylation; H3K27me3; cisplatin; epigenetics; polycomb repressive complex.
Analyzing the Interactions of mRNAs and ncRNAs to Predict Competing Endogenous RNA Networks in Osteosarcoma Chemo-Resistance.,Mol Ther, 2019 Mar 6,30692017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30692017/,Chemo-resistance is a huge obstacle encountered in the osteosarcoma (OS) treatment. Protein-coding mRNAs， as well as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)， including long ncRNA (lncRNA)， circular RNA (circRNA)， and microRNA (miRNA)， have been demonstrated to play an essential role in the regulation of cancer biology. However， the comprehensive expression profile and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network between mRNAs and ncRNAs in the OS chemo-resistance still remain unclear. In the current study， we developed whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) in the three paired multi-drug chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive OS cell lines to comprehensively identify differentially expressed lncRNAs， circRNAs， miRNAs， and mRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed for mRNAs with significantly different expression. Then the ceRNA networks combining lncRNAs， circRNAs， miRNAs， and mRNAs were predicted and constructed on the basis of the authoritative miRanda and TargetScan databases combined with the widely accepted vital drug resistance-related genes and signal transduction pathways. In addition， two constructed ceRNA regulatory pathways， lncRNAMEG3/hsa-miR-200b-3p/AKT2 and hsa_circ_0001258/hsa-miR-744-3p/GSTM2， were randomly selected and validated by real-time qPCR， RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)， RNA pull-down assay， and dual luciferase reporter gene system. Taken together， our findings may provide new evidence for the underlying mechanism of OS chemo-resistance and uncover some novel targets for reversing it.Keywords:ceRNA; chemo-resistance; mRNA; ncRNA; osteosarcoma.

The Inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator Kinases Prevents the Development of Resistance to EGFR-Targeting Drugs.,Cells, 2021 Jan 12,33445730,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33445730/,Drug resistance is the main obstacle to achieving cures with both conventional and targeted anticancer drugs. The emergence of acquired drug resistance is initially mediated by non-genetic transcriptional changes， which occur at a much higher frequency than mutations and may involve population-scale transcriptomic adaptation. CDK8/19 kinases， through association with transcriptional Mediator complex， regulate transcriptional reprogramming by co-operating with different signal-responsive transcription factors. Here we tested if CDK8/19 inhibition could prevent adaptation to drugs acting on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1/HER1). The development of resistance was analyzed following long-term exposure of BT474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells to EGFR-targeting small molecules (gefitinib， erlotinib) and of SW48 colon cancer cells to an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. In all cases， treatment of small cell populations (~105cells) with a single dose of the drug initially led to growth inhibition that was followed by the resumption of proliferation and development of drug resistance in the adapted populations. However， this adaptation was always prevented by the addition of selective CDK8/19 inhibitors， even though such inhibitors alone had only moderate or no effect on cell growth. These results indicate that combining EGFR-targeting drugs with CDK8/19 inhibitors may delay or prevent the development of tumor resistance to therapy.Keywords:CDK19; CDK8; EGFR; cetuximab; drug resistance; erlotinib; gefitinib.
Expression dynamics of periodic transcripts during cancer cell cycle progression and their correlation with anticancer drug sensitivity.,Mil Med Res, 2022 Dec 19,36529792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36529792/,Background:The cell cycle is at the center of cellular activities and is orchestrated by complex regulatory mechanisms， among which transcriptional regulation is one of the most important components. Alternative splicing dramatically expands the regulatory network by producing transcript isoforms of genes to exquisitely control the cell cycle. However， the patterns of transcript isoform expression in the cell cycle are unclear. Therapies targeting cell cycle checkpoints are commonly used as anticancer therapies， but none of them have been designed or evaluated at the alternative splicing transcript level. The utility of these transcripts as markers of cell cycle-related drug sensitivity is still unknown， and studies on the expression patterns of cell cycle-targeting drug-related transcripts are also rare.Methods:To explore alternative splicing patterns during cell cycle progression， we performed sequential transcriptomic assays following cell cycle synchronization in colon cancer HCT116 and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell lines， using flow cytometry and reference cell cycle transcripts to confirm the cell cycle phases of samples， and we developed a new algorithm to describe the periodic patterns of transcripts fluctuating during the cell cycle. Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) drug sensitivity datasets and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) transcript datasets were used to assess the correlation of genes and their transcript isoforms with drug sensitivity. We identified transcripts associated with typical drugs targeting cell cycle by determining correlation coefficients. Cytotoxicity assays were used to confirm the effect of ENST00000257904 against cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. Finally， alternative splicing transcripts associated with mitotic (M) phase arrest were analyzed using an RNA synthesis inhibition assay and transcriptome analysis.Results:We established high-resolution transcriptome datasets of synchronized cell cycle samples from colon cancer HCT116 and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The results of the cell cycle assessment showed that 43，326， 41，578 and 29，244 transcripts were found to be periodically expressed in HeLa， HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells， respectively， among which 1280 transcripts showed this expression pattern in all three cancer cell lines. Drug sensitivity assessments showed that a large number of these transcripts displayed a higher correlation with drug sensitivity than their corresponding genes. Cell cycle-related drug screening showed that the level of the CDK4 transcript ENST00000547281 was more significantly associated with the resistance of cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors than the level of the CDK4 reference transcript ENST00000257904. The transcriptional inhibition assay following M phase arrest further confirmed the M-phase-specific expression of the splicing transcripts. Combined with the cell cycle-related drug screening， the results also showed that a set of periodic transcripts， for example， ENST00000314392 (a dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase polypeptide 2 isoform transcript)， was more associated with drug sensitivity than the levels of their corresponding gene transcripts.Conclusions:In summary， we identified a panel of cell cycle-related periodic transcripts and found that the levels of transcripts of drug target genes showed different values for predicting drug sensitivity， providing novel insights into alternative splicing-related drug development and evaluation.Keywords:Alternative splicing; Cell cycle; Cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor; Dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase polypeptide 2; Drug resistance; Transcriptome.
Evaluating synergistic effects of metformin and simvastatin on ovarian cancer cells.,PLoS One, 2024 Mar 15,38489280,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38489280/,Background:Ovarian Cancer (OC) stands as the most lethal gynecological malignancy， presenting an urgent clinical challenge in the quest to improve response rates. One approach to address this challenge is through drug repurposing， exemplified by the investigation of metabolic-modulating drugs such as Metformin (MTF) and Simvastatin (SIM). This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms contributing to the potential synergistic anti-cancer effects between MTF and SIM on ovarian cancer cells.Methods:We assessed the effects of the combination on the proliferation and viability of two cell lines OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3. IC50 concentrations of MTF and SIM were determined using a proliferation assay， followed by subtoxic concentrations to explore the potential synergistic effects on the viability of both cell lines. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted on OVCAR-3 treated cells， and the findings were validated by assessing the expression levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through real-time PCR in both cell lines SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3.Results:Cytotoxicity analysis guided the selection of treatment concentrations as such MTF 10 mM and SIM 5 μM. The combined treatment of MTF and SIM demonstrated a synergistic inhibition of proliferation and viability in both cell lines. In OVCAR-3， exclusive identification of 507 DEGs was seen in the combination arm. Upregulation of FOXO3， RhoA， and TNFα， along with downregulation of PIK3R1， SKP2， and ATP6V1D levels， was observed in OVCAR-3 treated cells. Real-time PCR validation confirmed the consistency of expression levels for the mentioned DEGs.Conclusion:Our data strongly supports the presence of synergy between MTF and SIM in OC cells. The combination's effect is associated with the dysregulation of genes in the key regulators AMPK and mTOR alongside other interconnected pathways.
Analysis of chemotherapy response programs in ovarian cancers by the next-generation sequencing technologies.,Gynecol Oncol, 2010 May,20181382,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20181382/,Objective:To understand the chemotherapy response program in ovarian cancer cells at deep transcript sequencing levels.Methods:Two next-generation sequencing technologies--MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) and SBS (sequencing by synthesis)--were used to sequence the transcripts of IGROV1 and IGROV1-CP cells， and to sequence the transcripts of a highly chemotherapy responsive and a highly chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer tissue.Results:We identified 3422 signatures (2957 genes) that are significantly different between IGROV1 and IGROV1-CP cells (P<0.001). Gene Ontology (GO) term GO:0001837 (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and GO:0034330 (cell junction assembly and maintenance) are enriched in genes that are over expressed in IGROV1-CP cells while apoptosis-related GO terms are enriched in genes over expressed in IGROV1 cells. We identified 1187 tags (corresponding to 1040 genes) that are differentially expressed between the chemotherapy responsive and the persistently chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer tissues. GO term GO:0050673 (epithelial cell proliferation) and GO:0050678 (regulation of epithelial cell proliferation) are enriched in the genes over expressed in the chemotherapy resistant tissue while the GO:0007229 (integrin-mediated signaling pathway) is enriched in the genes over expressed in the chemotherapy sensitive tissue. An integrative analysis identified 111 common differentially expressed genes including two bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP4 and BMP7)， six solute carrier proteins (SLC10A3， SLC16A3， SLC25A1， SLC35B3， SLC7A5 and SLC7A7)， transcription factor POU5F1 (POU class 5 homeobox 1)， and KLK10 (kallikrein-related peptidase 10). A network analysis revealed a subnetwork with three genes BMP7， NR2F2 and AP2B1 that were consistently over expressed in the chemoresistant tissue or cells compared to the chemosensitive tissue or cells.Conclusion:Our database offers the first comprehensive view of the digital transcriptomes of ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues with different chemotherapy response phenotypes.
Strong activation of p53 by actinomycin D and nutlin-3a overcomes the resistance of cancer cells to the pro-apoptotic activity of the FAS ligand.,Apoptosis, 2024 Oct,39068622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39068622/,The FAS ligand (FASLG) is expressed on lymphocytes， which employ it to activate death receptors on target cells. Cancer cells are generally resistant to apoptosis triggered by FASLG. In this work， we found a way to circumvent this resistance by treatment with actinomycin D (ActD) and nutlin-3a (Nut3a). We selected this drug combination based on our transcriptomic data showing strong activation of proapoptotic genes， including those for receptor-mediated apoptosis， in cells exposed to actinomycin D and nutlin-3a. To test our hypothesis， we pre-exposed cancer cell lines to this drug combination for 45 h and then treated them with recombinant FASLG. This almost instantaneously killed most cells. Actinomycin D and nutlin-3a strongly cooperated in the sensitization because the effect of the drugs acting solo was not as spectacular as the drug combination， which together with FASLG killed more than 99% of cells. Based on the caspase activation pattern (caspase-8， caspase-9， caspase-10)， we conclude that both extrinsic and intrinsic pro-apoptotic pathways were engaged. In engineered p53-deficient cells， this pro-apoptotic effect was completely abrogated. Therefore， the combination of ActD + Nut3a activates p53 in an extraordinary way， which overcomes the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis triggered by FASLG. Interestingly， other combinations of drugs， e.g.， etoposide + nutlin-3a， actinomycin D + RG7112， and actinomycin D + idasanutlin had a similar effect. Moreover， normal human fibroblasts are less sensitive to death induced by ActD + Nut3a + FASLG. Our findings create the opportunity to revive the abandoned attempts of cancer immunotherapy employing the recombinant FAS ligand.Keywords:Apoptosis; Cancer immunotherapy; Death receptor; FASLG; MDM2; p53.

Aberrant change in the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) mediated signaling cascade is one of the decisive steps during the pathogenesis of fluorosis. Up to date， role of fluoride on the epigenetic alterations is not studied. In the present study， global expression profiling of short noncoding RNAs， in particular miRNAs and snoRNAs， was carried out in sodium fluoride (NaF) treated human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells to understand their possible role in the development of fluorosis. qPCR and in silico hybridization revealed that miR-124 and miR-155 can be directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL) genes. Compared to control， C/D box analysis revealed marked elevation in the number of UG dinucleotides and D-box sequences in NaF exposed HOS cells. Herein， we report miR-124 and miR-155 as the new possible players involved in the development of fluorosis. We show that the alterations in UG dinucleotides and D-box sequences of snoRNAs could be due to NaF exposure.

PML-RARa modulates the vascular signature of extracellular vesicles released by acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.,Angiogenesis, 2016 Jan,26374632,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26374632/,Oncogenic transformation is believed to impact the vascular phenotype and microenvironment in cancer， at least in part， through mechanisms involving extracellular vesicles (EVs). We explored these questions in the context of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4) expressing oncogenic fusion protein， PML-RARa and exquisitely sensitive to its clinically used antagonist， the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We report that NB4 cells produce considerable numbers of EVs， which are readily taken up by cultured endothelial cells triggering their increased survival. NB4 EVs contain PML-RARa transcript， but no detectable protein， which is also absent in endothelial cells upon the vesicle uptake， thereby precluding an active intercellular trafficking of this oncogene in this setting. ATRA treatment changes the emission profile of NB4-related EVs resulting in preponderance of smaller vesicles， an effect that occurs in parallel with the onset of cellular differentiation. ATRA also increases IL-8 mRNA and protein content in NB4 cells and their EVs， while decreasing the levels of VEGF and tissue factor (TF). Endothelial cell uptake of NB4-derived EVs renders these cells more TF-positive and procoagulant， and this effect is diminished by pre-treatment of EV donor cells with ATRA. Profiling angiogenesis-related transcripts in intact and ATRA-treated APL cells and their EVs reveals multiple differences attributable to cellular responses and EV molecular packaging. These observations point to the potential significance of changes in the angiogenic signature and activity associated with EVs released from tumor cells subjected to targeted therapy.Keywords:ATRA; Acute promyelocytic leukemia; Angiogenesis; Angiogenic signature; Cancer biomarker; Endothelial cells; Exosomes; Extracellular RNA; Extracellular vesicles; Oncogene; PML–RARa; Targeted agents; Tissue factor.
SBFI26 induces triple-negative breast cancer cells ferroptosis via lipid peroxidation.,J Cell Mol Med, 2024 Apr,38516826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38516826/,SBFI26， an inhibitor of FABP5， has been shown to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of tumour cells. However， the underlying mechanism by which SBFI26 induces ferroptosis in breast cancer cells remains largely unknown. Three breast cancer cell lines were treated with SBFI26 and CCK-8 assessed cytotoxicity. Transcriptome was performed on the Illumina platform and verified by qPCR. Western blot evaluated protein levels. Malondialdehyde (MDA)， total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD)， Fe， glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were measured. SBFI26 induced cell death time- and dose-dependent， with a more significant inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Fer-1， GSH and Vitamin C attenuated the effects but not erastin. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that SBFI26 treatment significantly enriched differentially expressed genes related to ferroptosis. Furthermore， SBFI26 increased intracellular MDA， iron ion， and GSSG levels while decreasing T-SOD， total glutathione (T-GSH)， and GSH levels.SBFI26 dose-dependently up-regulates the expression of HMOX1 and ALOX12 at both gene and protein levels， promoting ferroptosis. Similarly， it significantly increases the expression of SAT1， ALOX5， ALOX15， ALOXE3 and CHAC1 that， promoting ferroptosis while downregulating the NFE2L2 gene and protein that inhibit ferroptosis. SBFI26 leads to cellular accumulation of fatty acids， which triggers excess ferrous ions and subsequent lipid peroxidation for inducing ferroptosis.Keywords:SBFI26; TNBC; ferroptosis; lipid peroxidation; transcriptome.
Calcitriol reduces Newcastle disease virus replication by modulating galectin 3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines.,Arch Virol, 2024 Nov 27,39601906,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39601906/,Calcitriol， or vitamin D (Vit D)， is known for promoting strong bones and its ability to modulate inflammation and support the immune system. It has also been reported to be a potent antiviral agent， but the underlying mechanisms behind the mode of action are still unclear. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and causes infectious diseases in numerous avian species. In the present study， we explored the use of calcitriol as an antiviral agent against NDV infection. Post-treatment with calcitriol (the most active form of Vit D) was found to inhibit NDV replication in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1) in a time-of-addition- and concentration-dependent manner. The titer of NDV in allantoic fluid exhibited a substantial decrease after administration of cholecalciferol (the less active form of Vit D) to a 9-day-old chicken embryo. In addition， the results demonstrated a significant modulation of galectin 3 gene expression after NDV infection. Cytokine profiling of DF-1 cells treated with calcitriol and aloe-emodin， a known modulator of galectin 3， revealed significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The study indicates that calcitriol modulates host proteins， affecting NDV replication. These findings suggest that calcitriol or Vit D has the potential to be developed as an alternative antiviral drug against NDV， warranting further investigation.
C-Phycocyanin Suppresses the In Vitro Proliferation and Migration of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells through Reduction of RIPK1/NF-kappaB Activity.,Mar Drugs, 2019 Jun 18,31216707,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31216707/,Phycocyanin， derived from Spirulina platensis， is a type of natural antineoplastic marine protein. It is known that phycocyanin exerts anticancer effects on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells， but its underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Herein， the antitumor function and regulatory mechanism of phycocyanin were investigated in three NSCLC cell lines for the first time: H358， H1650， and LTEP-a2. Cell phenotype experiments suggested that phycocyanin could suppress the survival rate， proliferation， colony formation， and migration abilities， as well as induce apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Subsequently， transcriptome analysis revealed that receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) was significantly down-regulated by phycocyanin in the LTEP-a2 cell， which was further validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis in two other cell lines. Interestingly， similar to phycocyanin-treated assays， siRNA knockdown of RIPK1 expression also resulted in growth and migration inhibition of NSCLC cells. Moreover， the activity of NF-κB signaling was also suppressed after silencing RIPK1 expression， indicating that phycocyanin exerted anti-proliferative and anti-migratory function through down-regulating RIPK1/NF-κB activity in NSCLC cells. This study proposes a mechanism of action for phycocyanin involving both NSCLC apoptosis and down regulation of NSCLC genes.Keywords:NF-κB; migration; non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); phycocyanin; proliferation; receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1).
The phytoestrogen genistein modulates lysosomal metabolism and transcription factor EB (TFEB) activation.,J Biol Chem, 2014 Jun 13,24770416,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24770416/,Genistein (5，7-dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) has been previously proposed as a potential drug for use in substrate reduction therapy for mucopolysaccharidoses， a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by mutations leading to inefficient degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. It was demonstrated that this isoflavone can cross the blood-brain barrier， making it an especially desirable potential drug for the treatment of neurological symptoms present in most lysosomal storage diseases. So far， no comprehensive genomic analyses have been performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect elicited by genistein. Therefore， the aim of this work was to identify the genistein-modulated gene network regulating GAG biosynthesis and degradation， taking into consideration the entire lysosomal metabolism. Our analyses identified over 60 genes with known roles in lysosomal biogenesis and/or function whose expression was enhanced by genistein. Moreover， 19 genes whose products are involved in both GAG synthesis and degradation pathways were found to be remarkably differentially regulated by genistein treatment. We found a regulatory network linking genistein-mediated control of transcription factor EB (TFEB) gene expression， TFEB nuclear translocation， and activation of TFEB-dependent lysosome biogenesis to lysosomal metabolism. Our data indicate that the molecular mechanism of genistein action involves not only impairment of GAG synthesis but more importantly lysosomal enhancement via TFEB. These findings contribute to explaining the beneficial effects of genistein in lysosomal storage diseases as well as envisage new therapeutic approaches to treat these devastating diseases.Keywords:Flavonoid; Gene Expression; Genistein; Lysosomal Metabolism; Lysosomal Storage Disease; Microarray; Neurodegenerative Disease; Substrate Reduction Therapy; Transcriptomic Network Analysis; Transcriptomics.
A novel piperine derivative HJJ_3_5 inhibits colorectal cancer progression by modulating EMT signaling pathways.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2025 Feb 16,39842333,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39842333/,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a fatal cancer prevalent worldwide， and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key factor in tumor invasion and metastasis. Piperine， a natural alkaloid known for its antitumor properties， faces limitations in clinical use due to its moderate potency. To address this， our team synthesized and validated a new derivative， HJJ_3_5， which has shown potent antitumor activity against CRC cells. We assessed HJJ_3_5's inhibitory effects on the colon cancer cell line HCT116 through MTT， colony formation， and assays for cell migration and invasion. To uncover HJJ_3_5's molecular mechanisms， we utilized transcriptomics， weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)， and machine learning to identify key EMT-related genes. Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the expression changes of these key proteins. Our findings indicate that HJJ_3_5 significantly suppressed the proliferation， migration， and invasion of HCT116 cells in vitro， outperforming piperine. We discovered that HJJ_3_5 downregulated the expression of COL12A1， PJA2， VCAN， MEF2C， DPYD， and DDR2 genes in HCT116 cells， which resulted in a decrease in the EMT regulator SNAI1， thus inhibiting EMT in these cells. In summary， this study presents novel evidence that the piperine derivative HJJ_3_5 inhibits the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells through SNAI1-mediated EMT.Keywords:Colorectal cancer; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT); HJJ_3_5; Machine learning; Metastasis; Piperine derivative; Transcriptomics.
Investigating the antioxidant and anticancer potential of Daucus spp. extracts against human prostate cancer cell line C4-2， and lung cancer cell line A549.,J Ethnopharmacol, 2025 Jan 30,39332616,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39332616/,The study evaluated 297 carrot germplasm lines， focusing on 52 cultivars to explore their therapeutic potential and address challenges related to the accessibility and affordability of nutraceuticals and health promoting foods. The investigation explores the application of DNA barcoding using the ITS region for precise species identification， highlighting genetic diversity among the examined cultivars. Through ITS sequence-based analysis and phylogenetic examination， six diverse Daucus spp. genotypes were differentiated and classified into distinct groups， indicating the presence of vast genetic variation. Evaluation of antioxidant activities using the DPPH radical scavenging assay revealed varying degrees of scavenging ability among genotypes with SKAU-C-15， SKAU-C-17， and SKAU-C-16 exhibiting the highest activity， suggesting their potential for antioxidant-rich products. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) bioautography confirmed the presence of bioactive compounds in carrot extracts responsible for their antioxidant properties. In cell culture studies， specific carrot genotype extracts demonstrated potential anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects on recurrent prostate cancer cell line - C4-2 (SKAU-C-30， SKAU-C-10， and SKAU-C-42) and non-small cell lung cancer cell line - A549 (SKAU-C-18 and SKAU-C-11) cancer cells， as indicated by MTT assay， wound healing assay， and Colony Forming Unit assay. These findings suggest the promising therapeutic potential of carrot genotypes for developing anti-cancer functional foods， nutraceuticals and health supplements.Therefore， the study contributes to the nutrition security， paving the way for advancements in functional foods and health applications， particularly in cancer treatment and prevention.Keywords:Anti-metastatic effect; Anti-proliferative effect; Anticancer compounds and functional foods; Antioxidant activity; DNA barcoding; DPPH assay; Daucus spp.; ITS; MTT assay; TLC.
Role of pyruvate kinase M2 in transcriptional regulation leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2014 Oct 28,25313085,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25313085/,Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is an alternatively spliced variant of the pyruvate kinase gene that is preferentially expressed during embryonic development and in cancer cells. PKM2 alters the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis， resulting in the cancer-specific Warburg effect (also referred to as aerobic glycolysis). Although previous reports suggest that PKM2 functions in nonmetabolic transcriptional regulation， its significance in cancer biology remains elusive. Here we report that stimulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) results in the nuclear translocation of PKM2 in colon cancer cells， which is pivotal in promoting EMT. Immunoprecipitation and LC-electrospray ionized TOF MS analyses revealed that EMT stimulation causes direct interaction of PKM2 in the nucleus with TGF-β-induced factor homeobox 2 (TGIF2)， a transcriptional cofactor repressor of TGF-β signaling. The binding of PKM2 with TGIF2 recruits histone deacetylase 3 to the E-cadherin promoter sequence， with subsequent deacetylation of histone H3 and suppression of E-cadherin transcription. This previously unidentified finding of the molecular interaction of PKM2 in the nucleus sheds light on the significance of PKM2 expression in cancer cells.Keywords:colorectal cancer; epithelial–mesenchymal transition; invasion; pyruvate kinase M2; transforming growth factor-β–induced factor homeobox 2.
Activation of the epidermal growth factor signalling pathway by tissue plasminogen activator in pancreas cancer cells.,Gut, 2007 Sep,17452424,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17452424/,Background:Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the major activator of plasminogen in plasma. This serine protease is overexpressed by exocrine pancreas tumour cells， where it promotes tumour cell proliferation， growth， and invasion. Here we have explored the signalling pathways used by tPA to activate the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.Methods:Transcriptional profiling on cDNA micro arrays was used to analyse the pattern of gene expression in response to tPA compared to the response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Results were confirmed using different biochemical assays in which specific kinase inhibitors or RNA interference were used.Results:Transcriptional profiling showed that tPA modulates the expression of a set of genes commonly regulated by EGF， but distinct from the major set of genes modulated by PDGF. This suggested that tPA and EGF share common signalling pathways， a conclusion supported by further experimental evidence. Firstly， we found that tPA induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of the EGFR. Secondly， specific EGFR kinase inhibitors， but not PDGFR kinase inhibitors， abolished the tPA induced phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 kinases and cell proliferation. The mitogenic activity of tPA was also inhibited by siRNA depletion of EGFR， thus confirming the involvement of this receptor in tPA triggered signalling. Thirdly， we show that the signalling and mitogenic effects of tPA require its proteolytic activity， the activity of the metalloprotease-9 and active hb-EGF.Conclusion:Our results suggest that tPA induces proliferation by triggering a proteolytic cascade that sequentially activates plasmin， metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and hb-EGF. These events are required to activate the EGFR signalling pathway and cell proliferation.
Intrinsic Resistance to MEK Inhibition through BET Protein-Mediated Kinome Reprogramming in NF1-Deficient Ovarian Cancer.,Mol Cancer Res, 2019 Aug,31043489,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31043489/,Mutation or deletion of Neurofibromin 1 (NF1)， an inhibitor of RAS signaling， frequently occurs in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)， supporting therapies that target downstream RAS effectors， such as the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. However， no comprehensive studies have been carried out testing the efficacy of MEK inhibition in NF1-deficient EOC. Here， we performed a detailed characterization of MEK inhibition in NF1-deficient EOC cell lines using kinome profiling and RNA sequencing. Our studies showed MEK inhibitors (MEKi) were ineffective at providing durable growth inhibition in NF1-deficient cells due to kinome reprogramming. MEKi-mediated destabilization of FOSL1 resulted in induced expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and their downstream RAF and PI3K signaling， thus overcoming MEKi therapy. MEKi synthetic enhancement screens identified BRD2 and BRD4 as integral mediators of the MEKi-induced RTK signatures. Inhibition of bromo and extra terminal (BET) proteins using BET bromodomain inhibitors blocked MEKi-induced RTK reprogramming， indicating that BRD2 and BRD4 represent promising therapeutic targets in combination with MEKi to block resistance due to kinome reprogramming in NF1-deficient EOC. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest MEK inhibitors will likely not be effective as single-agent therapies in NF1-deficient EOC due to kinome reprogramming. Cotargeting BET proteins in combination with MEKis to block reprogramming at the transcriptional level may provide an epigenetic strategy to overcome MEKi resistance in NF1-deficient EOC.
Inhibition of SIRT6 in prostate cancer reduces cell viability and increases sensitivity to chemotherapeutics.,Protein Cell, 2013 Sep,23982738,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23982738/,SIRT6 is an important histone modifying protein that regulates DNA repair， telomere maintenance， energy metabolism， and target gene expression. Recently SIRT6 has been identified as a tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in certain cancer types， but not in other cancers. From deposited gene profiling studies we found that SIRT6 was overexpressed in prostate tumors， compared with normal or paratumor prostate tissues. Tissue micro-array studies confirmed the higher levels of SIRT6 in both prostate tumor tissues and prostate cancer cells than in their normal counterparts. Knockdown of SIRT6 in human prostate cancer cells led to sub-G1 phase arrest of cell cycle， increased apoptosis， elevated DNA damage level and decrease in BCL2 gene expression. Moreover， SIRT6-deficiency reduced cell viability and enhanced chemotherapeutics sensitivity. Taken together， this study provides the first evidence of SIRT6 overexpression in human prostate cancer， and SIRT6 regulation could be exploited for prostate cancer therapy.Keywords:SI RT6; overexpression; prostate cancer; therapy.
A co-formulation of interferons alpha2b and gamma distinctively targets cell cycle in the glioblastoma-derived cell line U-87MG.,BMC Cancer, 2023 Aug 29,37644431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37644431/,Background:HeberFERON is a co-formulation of α2b and γ interferons， based on their synergism， which has shown its clinical superiority over individual interferons in basal cell carcinomas. In glioblastoma (GBM)， HeberFERON has displayed promising preclinical and clinical results. This led us to design a microarray experiment aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in the distinctive effect of HeberFERON compared to the individual interferons in U-87MG model.Methods:Transcriptional expression profiling including a control (untreated) and three groups receiving α2b-interferon， γ-interferon and HeberFERON was performed using an Illumina HT-12 microarray platform. Unsupervised methods for gene and sample grouping， identification of differentially expressed genes， functional enrichment and network analysis computational biology methods were applied to identify distinctive transcription patterns of HeberFERON. Validation of most representative genes was performed by qPCR. For the cell cycle analysis of cells treated with HeberFERON for 24 h， 48 and 72 h we used flow cytometry.Results:The three treatments show different behavior based on the gene expression profiles. The enrichment analysis identified several mitotic cell cycle related events， in particular from prometaphase to anaphase， which are exclusively targeted by HeberFERON. The FOXM1 transcription factor network that is involved in several cell cycle phases and is highly expressed in GBMs， is significantly down regulated. Flow cytometry experiments corroborated the action of HeberFERON on the cell cycle in a dose and time dependent manner with a clear cellular arrest as of 24 h post-treatment. Despite the fact that p53 was not down-regulated， several genes involved in its regulatory activity were functionally enriched. Network analysis also revealed a strong relationship of p53 with genes targeted by HeberFERON. We propose a mechanistic model to explain this distinctive action， based on the simultaneous activation of PKR and ATF3， p53 phosphorylation changes， as well as its reduced MDM2 mediated ubiquitination and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. PLK1， AURKB， BIRC5 and CCNB1 genes， all regulated by FOXM1， also play central roles in this model. These and other interactions could explain a G2/M arrest and the effect of HeberFERON on the proliferation of U-87MG.Conclusions:We proposed molecular mechanisms underlying the distinctive behavior of HeberFERON compared to the treatments with the individual interferons in U-87MG model， where cell cycle related events were highly relevant.Keywords:AURKB; Alpha interferon; BIRC5(Survivin); CDC20; Drug combination; FOXM1; Gamma interferon; Glioblastoma; HeberFERON; Mitotic cell cycle; PLK1; STAT1; U-87MG; p53.
Regulatory Crosstalk of Doxorubicin， Estradiol and TNFalpha Combined Treatment in Breast Cancer-derived Cell Lines.,Sci Rep, 2019 Oct 23,31645610,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31645610/,We present a new model of ESR1 network regulation based on analysis of Doxorubicin， Estradiol， and TNFα combination treatment in MCF-7. We used Doxorubicin as a therapeutic agent， TNFα as marker and mediator of an inflammatory microenvironment and 17β-Estradiol (E2) as an agonist of Estrogen Receptors， known predisposing factor for hormone-driven breast cancer， whose pharmacological inhibition reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Based on the results of transcriptomics analysis， we found 71 differentially expressed genes that are specific for the combination treatment with Doxorubicin + Estradiol + TNFα in comparison with single or double treatments. The responsiveness to the triple treatment was examined for seven genes by qPCR， of which six were validated， and then extended to four additional cell lines differing for p53 and/or ER status. The results of differential regulation enrichment analysis highlight the role of the ESR1 network that included 36 of 71 specific differentially expressed genes. We propose that the combined activation of p53 and NF-kB transcription factors significantly influences ligand-dependent， ER-driven transcriptional responses， also of the ESR1 gene itself. These results provide a model of coordinated interaction of TFs to explain the Doxorubicin， E2 and TNFα induced repression mechanisms.
Phenotype-based variation as a biomarker of sensitivity to molecularly targeted therapy in melanoma.,Medchemcomm, 2017 Jan 1,28670440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28670440/,Transcriptomic phenotypes defined for melanoma have been reported to correlate with sensitivity to various drugs. In this study， we aimed to define a minimal signature that could be used to distinguish melanoma sub-typesin vitro， and to determine suitable drugs by which these sub-types can be targeted. By using primary melanoma cell lines， as well as commercially available melanoma cell lines， we find that the evaluation of MLANA and INHBA expression is as capable as one based on a combined analysis performed with genes for stemness， EMT and invasion/proliferation， in identifying melanoma subtypes that differ in their sensitivity to molecularly targeted drugs. Using this approach， we find that 75% of melanoma cell lines can be treated with either the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 or the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG.
Associations between transcriptional changes and protein phenotypes provide insights into immune regulation in corals.,Dev Comp Immunol, 2016 Sep,27109903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27109903/,Disease outbreaks in marine ecosystems have driven worldwide declines of numerous taxa， including corals. Some corals， such as Orbicella faveolata， are particularly susceptible to disease. To explore the mechanisms contributing to susceptibility， colonies of O. faveolata were exposed to immune challenge with lipopolysaccharides. RNA sequencing and protein activity assays were used to characterize the response of corals to immune challenge. Differential expression analyses identified 17 immune-related transcripts that varied in expression post-immune challenge. Network analyses revealed several groups of transcripts correlated to immune protein activity. Several transcripts， which were annotated as positive regulators of immunity were included in these groups， and some were downregulated following immune challenge. Correlations between expression of these transcripts and protein activity results further supported the role of these transcripts in positive regulation of immunity. The observed pattern of gene expression and protein activity may elucidate the processes contributing to the disease susceptibility of species like O. faveolata.Keywords:Corals; Disease; Disease ecology; Innate immunity; Invertebrate immunity; Susceptibility.
Comparative genomic hybridisation arrays: high-throughput tools to determine targeted therapy in breast cancer.,Pathobiology, 2008,18544961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18544961/,Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) is contributing to the molecular characterisation of solid malignancies. This technique provides tremendous opportunities for translational research by facilitating detailed analysis of entire cancer genomes in a single experiment with unprecedented resolution. Apart from providing data to help catalogue the molecular genetic profiles of breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines， aCGH has also proven to be a useful technique for the identification of novel therapeutic targets. However， aCGH alone does not provide all lines of evidence required for the identification of 'amplicon drivers' and 'druggable targets'. This can be more effectively achieved by integrating data from aCGH， expression profiling and RNA interference experiments. In this review， we discuss the techniques available for aCGH analysis and possible approaches for using aCGH as a tool for the identification of novel therapeutic targets.
Expression profiling of palmitate- and oleate-regulated genes provides novel insights into the effects of chronic lipid exposure on pancreatic beta-cell function.,Diabetes, 2002 Apr,11916915,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11916915/,Chronic lipid exposure is implicated in beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. We therefore used oligonucleotide arrays to define global alterations in gene expression in MIN6 cells after 48-h pretreatment with oleate or palmitate. Altogether， 126 genes were altered > or =1.9-fold by palmitate， 62 by oleate， and 46 by both lipids. Importantly， nine of the palmitate-regulated genes are known to be correspondingly changed in models of type 2 diabetes. A tendency toward beta-cell de-differentiation was also apparent with palmitate: pyruvate carboxylase and mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were downregulated， whereas lactate dehydrogenase and fructose 1，6-bisphosphatases were induced. Increases in the latter (also seen with oleate)， along with glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyl transferase， imply upregulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway in palmitate-treated cells. However， palmitate also increased expression of calcyclin and 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP25)， which control distal secretory processes. Consistent with these findings， secretory responses to noncarbohydrate stimuli， especially palmitate itself， were upregulated in palmitate-treated cells (much less so with oleate). Indeed， glucose-stimulated secretion was slightly sensitized by chronic palmitate exposure but inhibited by oleate treatment， whereas both lipids enhanced basal secretion. Oleate and palmitate also induced expression of chemokines (MCP-1 and GRO1 oncogene) and genes of the acute phase response (serum amyloid A3). Increases in transcriptional modulators such as ATF3， CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta)， C/EBPdelta， and c-fos were also seen. The results highlight links between regulated gene expression and phenotypic alterations in palmitate versus oleate-pretreated beta-cells.
The PPARγ-SETD8 axis constitutes an epigenetic， p53-independent checkpoint on p21-mediated cellular senescence.,Aging Cell, 2017 Aug,28514051,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28514051/,Cellular senescence is a permanent proliferative arrest triggered by genome instability or aberrant growth stresses， acting as a protective or even tumor-suppressive mechanism. While several key aspects of gene regulation have been known to program this cessation of cell growth， the involvement of the epigenetic regulation has just emerged but remains largely unresolved. Using a systems approach that is based on targeted gene profiling， we uncovered known and novel chromatin modifiers with putative link to the senescent state of the cells. Among these， we identified SETD8 as a new target as well as a key regulator of the cellular senescence signaling. Knockdown of SETD8 triggered senescence induction in proliferative culture， irrespectively of the p53 status of the cells; ectopic expression of this epigenetic writer alleviated the extent doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence. This repressive effect of SETD8 in senescence was mediated by directly maintaining the silencing mark H4K20me1 at the locus of the senescence switch gene p21. Further in support of this regulatory link， depletion of p21 reversed this SETD8-mediated cellular senescence. Additionally， we found that PPARγ acts upstream and regulates SETD8 expression in proliferating cells. Downregulation of PPARγ coincided with the senescence induction， while its activation inhibited the progression of this process. Viewed together， our findings delineated a new epigenetic pathway through which the PPARγ-SETD8 axis directly silences p21 expression and consequently impinges on its senescence-inducing function. This implies that SETD8 may be part of a cell proliferation checkpoint mechanism and has important implications in antitumor therapeutics.Keywords:H4K20me1; SETD8/KMT5A; cellular senescence; epigenetic; p21; p53.
2，5-Hexanedione Affects Ovarian Granulosa Cells in Swine by Regulating the CDKN1A Gene: A Transcriptome Analysis.,Vet Sci, 2023 Mar 7,36977240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36977240/,N-hexane， a common industrial organic solvent， causes multiple organ damage owing to its metabolite， 2，5-hexanedione (2，5-HD). To identify and evaluate the effects of 2，5-HD on sows' reproductive performance， we used porcine ovarian granulosa cells (pGCs) as a vehicle and carried out cell morphology and transcriptome analyses. 2，5-HD has the potential to inhibit the proliferation of pGCs and induce morphological changes and apoptosis depending on the dose. RNA-seq analyses identified 4817 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)， with 2394 down-regulated and 2423 up-regulated following 2，5-HD exposure treatment. The DEG， cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A)， according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis， was significantly enriched in the p53 signaling pathway. Thus， we evaluated its function in pGC apoptosis in vitro. Then， we knocked down theCDKN1Agene in the pGCs to identify its effects on pGCs. Its knockdown decreased pGC apoptosis， with significantly fewer cells in the G1 phase (p< 0.05) and very significantly more cells in the S phase (p< 0.01). Herein， we revealed novel candidate genes that influence pGCs apoptosis and cell cycle and provided new insights into the role ofCDKN1Ain pGCs during apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.Keywords:2，5-Hexanedione(2，5-HD); CDKN1A; apoptosis; granulosa cells; sow.
The G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor Agonist G-1 Mediates Antitumor Effects by Activating Apoptosis Pathways and Regulating Migration and Invasion in Cervical Cancer Cells.,Cancers (Basel), 2024 Sep 27,39409923,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39409923/,Background/objectives:Estrogens and HPV are necessary for cervical cancer (CC) development. The levels of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) increase as CC progresses， and HPV oncoproteins promote GPER expression. The role of this receptor is controversial due to its anti- and pro-tumor effects. This study aimed to determine the effect of GPER activation， using its agonist G-1， on the transcriptome， cell migration， and invasion in SiHa cells and non-tumorigenic keratinocytes transduced with the HPV16 E6 or E7 oncogenes.Methods:Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify G-1-enriched pathways in SiHa cells. We evaluated cell migration， invasion， and the expression of associated proteins in SiHa， HaCaT-16E6， and HaCaT-16E7 cells using various assays.Results:Transcriptome analysis revealed pathways associated with proliferation/apoptosis (TNF-α signaling， UV radiation response， mitotic spindle formation， G2/M cell cycle， UPR， and IL-6/JAK/STAT)， cellular metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation)， and cell migration (angiogenesis， EMT， and TGF-α signaling) in SiHa cells. Key differentially expressed genes included PTGS2 (pro/antitumor)， FOSL1， TNFRSF9， IL1B， DIO2， and PHLDA1 (antitumor)， along with under-expressed genes with pro-tumor effects that may inhibit proliferation. Additionally， DKK1 overexpression suggested inhibition of cell migration. G-1 increased vimentin expression in SiHa cells and reduced it in HaCaT-16E6 and HaCaT-16E7 cells. However， G-1 did not affect α-SMA expression or cell migration in any of the cell lines but increased invasion in HaCaT-16E7 cells.Conclusions:GPER is a promising prognostic marker due to its ability to activate apoptosis and inhibit proliferation without promoting migration/invasion in CC cells.

Treatment resistance analysis reveals GLUT-1-mediated glucose uptake as a major target of synthetic rocaglates in cancer cells.,Cancer Med, 2021 Oct,34546000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34546000/,Rocaglates are natural compounds that have been extensively studied for their ability to inhibit translation initiation. Rocaglates represent promising drug candidates for tumor treatment due to their growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic cells. In contrast to natural rocaglates， synthetic analogues of rocaglates have been less comprehensively characterized， but were also shown to have similar effects on the process of protein translation. Here， we demonstrate an enhanced growth-inhibitory effect of synthetic rocaglates when combined with glucose anti-metabolite 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in different cancer cell lines. Moreover， we unravel a new aspect in the mechanism of action of synthetic rocaglates involving reduction of glucose uptake mediated by downregulation or abrogation of glucose transporter GLUT-1 expression. Importantly， cells with genetically induced resistance to synthetic rocaglates showed substantially less pronounced treatment effect on glucose metabolism and did not demonstrate GLUT-1 downregulation， pointing at the crucial role of this mechanism for the anti-tumor activity of the synthetic rocaglates. Transcriptome profiling revealed glycolysis as one of the major pathways differentially regulated in sensitive and resistant cells. Analysis of synthetic rocaglate efficacy in a 3D tissue context with a co-culture of tumor and normal cells demonstrated a selective effect on tumor cells and substantiated the mechanistic observations obtained in cancer cell lines. Increased glucose uptake and metabolism is a universal feature across different tumor types. Therefore， targeting this feature by synthetic rocaglates could represent a promising direction for exploitation of rocaglates in novel anti-tumor therapies.Keywords:cancer biology; colorectal cancer; drug design; metabolic studies; molecular biology.

Autophagy regulated by lncRNA HOTAIR contributes to the cisplatin-induced resistance in endometrial cancer cells.,Biotechnol Lett, 2017 Oct,28721581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28721581/,Objectives:To identify whether lncRNAs (long non-coding RNA) participate in the regulation of cisplatin-resistant induced autophagy in endometrial cancer cells.Results:Autophagy activity was significantly boosted in cisplatin-resistant Ishikawa cells， a human endometrial cancer cell line， compared with that in parental Ishikawa cells. After analyzing the overall long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiling， a meaningful lncRNA， HOTAIR， was identified. It was down-regulated simultaneously in cisplatin-resistant Ishikawa cells and parental Ishikawa cells treated with cisplatin. RNA interference of HOTAIR reduced the proliferation of cisplatin-resistant Ishikawa cells and enhanced the autophagy activity of cisplatin-resistant Ishikawa cells with or without cisplatin treatment， in addition， beclin-1， multidrug resistance (MDR)， and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were mediated by lncRNA HOTAIR.Conclusions:It is clear that lncRNAs， specifically HOTAIR， can regulate the cisplatin-resistance ability of human endometrial cancer cells through the regulation of autophagy by influencing Beclin-1， MDR， and P-gp expression.Keywords:Autophagy; Cisplatin-resistance; Endometrial cancer; HOTAIR; Long noncoding RNA.

Tanshinone I reprograms glycolysis metabolism to regulate histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) and inhibits cancer cell growth in ovarian cancer.,Int J Biol Macromol, 2025 Feb,39710022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39710022/,Salvia miltiorrhiza， the anticancer properties of these components are multifaceted， encompassing the inhibition of tumor growth， prevention of the metastatic spread of cancer cells， enhancement of the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy， and the suppression of angiogenesis， which is crucial for tumor growth and survival. In the context of our recent study， we have discovered that tanshinone I， one of the active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza， possesses the ability to inhibit the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells， both in laboratory settings and within living organisms. To further understand the molecular mechanisms behind this effect， we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis. Our findings indicated that tanshinone I exerts its inhibitory action by downregulating the expression of genes associated with glycolysis. Specifically， tanshinone I decreased the expression of glycolysis-related genes such as HK2 (hexokinase 2)， PFK (phosphofructokinase)， ENO2 (enolase 2)， and LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A). Inhibiting lactate production by tanshinone I application reduced the level of histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la)， which reduced the expression of tumor-associated genes， such as TTK， PDGFRβ， YTHDF2 and RUBCNL. In addition， tanshinone I alleviated the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In summary， tanshinone I blocks glycolysis to regulate histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la)， which inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth， revealing the anticancer mechanism of tanshinone I.Keywords:Glycolysis; Lactate; Lactylation; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Tanshinone I; Tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.
MicroRNA-296 is enriched in cancer cells and downregulates p21WAF1 mRNA expression via interaction with its 3' untranslated region.,Nucleic Acids Res, 2011 Oct,21724611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21724611/,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding small RNAs that act as negative regulators of gene expression. To identify miRNAs that may regulate human cell immortalization and carcinogenesis， we performed comparative miRNA array profiling of human normal and SV40-T antigen immortalized cells. We found that miR-296 was upregulated in immortalized cells that also had activation of telomerase. By an independent experiment on genomic analysis of cancer cells we found that chromosome region (20q13.32)， where miR-296 is located， was amplified in 28/36 cell lines， and most of these showed enriched miR-296 expression. Overexpression of miR-296 in human cancer cells， with and without telomerase activity， had no effect on their telomerase function. Instead， it suppressed p53 function that is frequently downregulated during human cell immortalization and carcinogenesis. By monitoring the activity of a luciferase reporter connected to p53 and p21(WAF1) (p21) untranslated regions (UTRs)， we demonstrate that miR-296 interacts with the p21-3'UTR， and the Hu binding site of p21-3'UTR was identified as a potential miR-296 target site. We demonstrate for the first time that miR-296 is frequently upregulated during immortalization of human cells and contributes to carcinogenesis by downregulation of p53-p21(WAF1) pathway.

Revealing the pharmacological effects of Remodelin against osteosarcoma based on network pharmacology， acRIP-seq and experimental validation.,Sci Rep, 2024 Feb 13,38347067,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38347067/,Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone. Remodelin， an inhibitor of the N (4)-Acetylcytidine (ac4C) acetylation modifying enzyme N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10)， has been shown to have therapeutic effects on cancer in several studies， and our previous studies have confirmed the inhibitory effect of Remodelin on OS cells， however， the mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated. We used network pharmacological analysis to quantify the therapeutic targets of Remodelin against OS. acRIP-seq and RNA-seq were performed to investigate the inhibitory activity of Remodelin on acetylation and its effect on the transcriptome after intervening in OS cells U2OS with Remodelin in vitro. Key target genes were deduced based on their pharmacological properties， combined with network pharmacology results and sequencing results. Finally， the deduced target genes were validated with vitro experiments. Network pharmacological analysis showed that 2291 OS-related target genes and 369 Remodelin-related target genes were obtained， and 116 overlapping genes were identified as Remodelin targets for OS treatment. Sequencing results showed that a total of 13，736 statistically significant ac4C modification peaks were detected by acRIP-seq， including 6938 hypoacetylation modifications and 6798 hyperacetylation modifications. A total of 2350 statistically significant mRNAs were detected by RNA-seq， of which 830 were up-regulated and 1520 were down-regulated. Association analyses identified a total of 382 genes that were Hypoacetylated-down， consistent with inhibition of mRNA acetylation and expression by Remodelin. Five genes， CASP3， ESR2， FGFR2， IGF1 and MAPK1， were identified as key therapeutic targets of Remodelin against OS. Finally， in vitro experiments， CCK-8 and qRT-PCR demonstrated that Remodelin indeed inhibited the proliferation of OS cells and reduced the expression of three genes: ESR2， IGF1， and MAPK1. In conclusion， ESR2， IGF1 and MAPK1 were identified as key therapeutic targets of Remodelin against OS. This reveals the target of Remodelin's pharmacological action on OS and provides new ideas for the treatment of OS.
TReP-132 controls cell proliferation by regulating the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1.,Mol Cell Biol, 2005 Jun,15899840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15899840/,The transcriptional regulating protein of 132 kDa (TReP-132) has been identified in steroidogenic tissues， where it acts as a coactivator of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). We show here that TReP-132 plays a role in the control of cell proliferation. In human HeLa cells， TReP-132 knockdown by using small interfering RNA resulted in increased G(1)-->S cell cycle progression. The growth-inhibitory effects of TReP-132 was further shown to be mediated by induction of G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(WAF1) (p21) and p27(KIP1) (p27) expression levels. As a consequence， G(1) cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase activities and pRB phosphorylation were markedly reduced， and cell cycle progression was blocked in the G(1) phase. The stimulatory effect of TReP-132 on p21 and p27 gene transcription involved interaction of TReP-132 with the transcription factor Sp1 at proximal Sp1-binding sites in their promoters. Moreover， in different breast tumor cell lines， endogenous TReP-132 expression was positively related with a lower proliferation rate. In addition， TReP-132 knockdown resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and lowered p21 and p27 mRNA levels in the steroid-responsive and nonresponsive T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines， respectively. Finally， a statistic profiling of human breast tumor samples highlighted that expression of TReP-132 is correlated with p21 and p27 levels and is associated with lower tumor incidence and aggressiveness. Together， these results identify TReP-132 as a basal cell cycle regulatory protein acting， at least in part， by interacting with Sp1 to activate the p21 and p27 gene promoters.

Glucocorticoid promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer via co-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor and TET2.,Int J Cancer, 2025 Apr 15,39661335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39661335/,Glucocorticoids (GCs)， commonly used for anti-inflammatory and cancer treatments， have been linked to the promotion of cancer metastasis. Yet， the molecular mechanisms behind this potential remain poorly understood. Clarifying these mechanisms is crucial for a nuanced understanding and potential refinement of GC therapies in the context of cancer treatment. In HEK293T cells， co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were used with antibodies of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET) family proteins (TET1， TET2， TET3). Drug repositioning was performed through the Connectivity Map database， using common target genes of GR and TET2 in HEK293 and HCT116 cell lines and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cell migration and invasion were tested in CRC cell lines with varying GR expression， that is， HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. Dexamethasone (Dex) treatment resulted in a significant difference in cell migration rates in two CRC cell lines with disparate GR expression levels. Co-IP and ChIP-seq analyses substantiated the interaction between GR and TET family proteins in HEK293T cells. Belinostat， the selected compound， was successfully validated for its potential to counteract the effects of GC-induced invasion in CRC cells in vitro. Transcriptomic analyses of Belinostat-treated HCT116 cells revealed down-regulation of target genes associated with cancer metastasis. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying GC-induced metastasis， introducing newly repositioned compounds that could serve as potential adjuvant therapy to GC treatment. Furthermore， it opens avenues for exploring novel drug candidates for CRC treatment.Keywords:TET2; colorectal cancer; drug repositioning; glucocorticoid receptor.

Classification molecular subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma based on PRMT-related genes.,Front Pharmacol, 2023 Feb 22,36909154,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36909154/,Background:Recent studies highlighted the functional role of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyzing the methylation of protein arginine in malignant progression of various tumors. Stratification the subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is fundamental for exploring effective treatment strategies. Here， we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of PRMTs with bioinformatic tools to identify novel biomarkers for HCC subtypes classification and prognosis prediction， which may be potential ideal targets for therapeutic intervention.Methods:The expression profiling of PRMTs in HCC tissues was evaluated based on the data of TCGA-LIHC cohort， and further validated in HCC TMA cohort and HCC cell lines. HCC was systematically classified based on PRMT family related genes. Subsequently， the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between molecular subtypes were identified， and prognostic risk model were constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analysis to evaluate the prognosis， gene mutation， clinical features， immunophenotype， immunotherapeutic effect and antineoplastic drug sensitivity of HCC.Results:PRMTs expression was markedly altered both in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. Three molecular subtypes with distinct immunophenotype were generated. 11 PRMT-related genes were enrolled to establish prognostic model， which presented with high accuracy in predicting the prognosis of two risk groups in the training， validation， and immunotherapy cohort， respectively. Additionally， the two risk groups showed significant difference in immunotherapeutic efficacy. Further， the sensitivity of 72 anticancer drugs was identified using prognostic risk model.Conclusion:In summary， our findings stratified HCC into three subtypes based on the PRMT-related genes. The prognostic model established in this work provide novel insights into the exploration of related therapeutic approaches in treating HCC.Keywords:PRMT; antineoplastic drug; hepatocellular carcinoma; immunotherapy; molecular subtypes; prognostic molecular tool.

Improvement of the performance of anticancer peptides using a drug repositioning pipeline.,Biotechnol J, 2022 Jan,34657375,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34657375/,The use of anticancer peptides (ACPs) as an alternative/complementary strategy to conventional chemotherapy treatments has been shown to decrease drug resistance and/or severe side effects. However， the efficacy of the positively-charged ACP is inhibited by elevated levels of negatively-charged cell-surface components which trap the peptides and prevent their contact with the cell membrane. Consequently， this decreases ACP-mediated membrane pore formation and cell lysis. Negatively-charged heparan sulphate (HS) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) have been shown to inhibit the cytotoxic effect of ACPs. In this study， we propose a strategy to promote the broad utilization of ACPs. In this context， we developed a drug repositioning pipeline to analyse transcriptomics data generated for four different cancer cell lines (A549， HEPG2， HT29， and MCF7) treated with hundreds of drugs in the LINCS L1000 project. Based on previous studies identifying genes modulating levels of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) HS and CS at the cell surface， our analysis aimed at identifying drugs inhibiting genes correlated with high HS and CS levels. As a result， we identified six chemicals as likely repositionable drugs with the potential to enhance the performance of ACPs. The codes in R and Python programming languages are publicly available in https://github.com/ElyasMo/ACPs_HS_HSPGs_CS. As a conclusion， these six drugs are highlighted as excellent targets for synergistic studies with ACPs aimed at lowering the costs associated with ACP-treatment.Keywords:LINCS L1000; cancer; drug repositioning; heparan sulfate; therapeutic peptides.

HLAProfiler utilizes k-mer profiles to improve HLA calling accuracy for rare and common alleles in RNA-seq data.,Genome Med, 2017 Sep 27,28954626,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28954626/,Background:The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is a genomic region involved in regulating the human immune system by encoding cell membrane major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins that are responsible for self-recognition. Understanding the variation in this region provides important insights into autoimmune disorders， disease susceptibility， oncological immunotherapy， regenerative medicine， transplant rejection， and toxicogenomics. Traditional approaches to HLA typing are low throughput， target only a few genes， are labor intensive and costly， or require specialized protocols. RNA sequencing promises a relatively inexpensive， high-throughput solution for HLA calling across all genes， with the bonus of complete transcriptome information and widespread availability of historical data. Existing tools have been limited in their ability to accurately and comprehensively call HLA genes from RNA-seq data.Results:We created HLAProfiler ( https://github.com/ExpressionAnalysis/HLAProfiler )， a k-mer profile-based method for HLA calling in RNA-seq data which can identify rare and common HLA alleles with > 99% accuracy at two-field precision in both biological and simulated data. For 68% of novel alleles not present in the reference database， HLAProfiler can correctly identify the two-field precision or exact coding sequence， a significant advance over existing algorithms.Conclusions:HLAProfiler allows for accurate HLA calls in RNA-seq data， reliably expanding the utility of these data in HLA-related research and enabling advances across a broad range of disciplines. Additionally， by using the observed data to identify potential novel alleles and update partial alleles， HLAProfiler will facilitate further improvements to the existing database of reference HLA alleles.

RNA-seq and ChIP-seq Identification of Unique and Overlapping Targets of GLI Transcription Factors in Melanoma Cell Lines.,Cancers (Basel), 2022 Sep 19,36139698,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36139698/,Background:Despite significant progress in therapy， melanoma still has a rising incidence worldwide， and novel treatment strategies are needed. Recently， researchers have recognized the involvement of the Hedgehog-GLI (HH-GLI) signaling pathway in melanoma and its consistent crosstalk with the MAPK pathway. In order to further investigate the link between the two pathways and to find new target genes that could be considered for combination therapy， we set out to find transcriptional targets of all three GLI proteins in melanoma.Methods:We performed RNA sequencing on three melanoma cell lines (CHL-1， A375， and MEL224) with overexpressed GLI1， GLI2， and GLI3 and combined them with the results of ChIP-sequencing on endogenous GLI1， GLI2， and GLI3 proteins. After combining these results， 21 targets were selected for validation by qPCR.Results:RNA-seq revealed a total of 808 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for GLI1， 941 DEGs for GLI2， and 58 DEGs for GLI3. ChIP-seq identified 527 genes that contained GLI1 binding sites in their promoters， 1103 for GLI2 and 553 for GLI3. A total of 15 of these targets were validated in the tested cell lines， 6 of which were detected by both RNA-seq and ChIP-seq.Conclusions:Our study provides insight into the unique and overlapping transcriptional output of the GLI proteins in melanoma. We suggest that our findings could provide new potential targets to consider while designing melanoma-targeted therapy.Keywords:GLI targets; HH-GLI pathway; MAPK pathway; melanoma; targeted therapy.
In Silico Integration of Transcriptome and Interactome Predicts an ETP-ALL-Specific Transcriptional Footprint that Decodes its Developmental Propensity.,Front Cell Dev Biol, 2022 May 13,35646901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35646901/,Early T precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) exhibits poor clinical outcomes and high relapse rates following conventional chemotherapeutic protocols. Extensive developmental flexibility of the multipotent ETP-ALL blasts with considerable intra-population heterogeneity in terms of immunophenotype and prognostic parameters might be a target for novel therapeutic interventions. Using a public gene expression dataset (GSE28703) from NCBI GEO DataSets with 12 ETP-ALL and 40 non-ETP-ALL samples， such heterogeneity was found to be reflected in their transcriptome as well. Hub genes were identified from the STRING-derived functional interaction network of genes showing differential expression between ETP-ALL and non-ETP-ALL as well as variable expression across ETP-ALL. Nine genes (KIT，HGF，NT5E，PROM1，CD33，ANPEP，CDH2，IL1B，andCXCL2) among the hubs were further validated as possible diagnostic ETP-ALL markers using another gene expression dataset (GSE78132) with 17 ETP-ALL and 27 non-ETP-ALL samples. Linear dimensionality reduction analysis with the expression levels of the hub genes in ETP-ALL revealed their divergent inclinations towards different hematopoietic lineages， proposing them as novel indicators of lineage specification in the incompletely differentiated ETP-ALL blasts. This further led to the formulation of a personalized lineage score calculation algorithm， which uncovered a considerable B-lineage-bias in a substantial fraction of ETP-ALL subjects from the GSE28703 and GSE78132 cohorts. In addition， STRING-derived physical interactome of the potential biomarkers displayed complete segregation of the B-lineage-skewed markers from other lineage-associated factors， highlighting their distinct functionality and possible druggability in ETP-ALL. A panel of these biomarkers might be useful in pinpointing the dominant lineage specification programmes in the ETP-ALL blasts on a personalized level， urging the development of novel lineage-directed precision therapies as well as repurposing of existing therapies against leukemia of different hematopoietic lineages; which might overcome the drawbacks of conventional chemotherapy.Keywords:ETP-ALL; biomarker; interactome; lineage specification; multipotency; personalized medicine; transcriptome analysis.
MicroRNA-93 activates c-Met/PI3K/Akt pathway activity in hepatocellular carcinoma by directly inhibiting PTEN and CDKN1A.,Oncotarget, 2015 Feb 20,25633810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25633810/,To assess the role of microRNAs (miR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)， we performed comprehensive microRNA expression profiling using HCC cell lines and identified miR-93 as a novel target associated with HCC. We further verified miR-93 expression levels in advanced HCC tumors (n=47) by a direct PCR assay and found that elevated miR-93 expression level is significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Elevated miR-93 expression significantly stimulated in vitro cell proliferation， migration and invasion， and additionally inhibited apoptosis. We confirmed that miR-93 directly bound with the 3' untranslated regions of the tumor-suppressor genes PTEN and CDKN1A， respectively，and inhibited their expression. As a result of this inhibition， the c-Met/PI3K/Akt pathway activity was enhanced. IHC analysis of HCC tumors showed significant correlation between c-Met protein expression levels and miR-93 expression levels. Knockdown of c-Met inhibited the activation of the c-Met/PI3K/Akt pathway regardless of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) treatment， and furthermore reduced the expression of miR-93 in these HCC cells. miR-93 also rendered cells to be more sensitive to sorafenib and tivantinib treatment. We concluded that miR-93 stimulated cell proliferation， migration， and invasion through the oncogenic c-Met/PI3K/Akt pathway and also inhibited apoptosis by directly inhibiting PTEN and CDKN1A expression in human HCC.
Karyotypically abnormal human ESCs are sensitive to HDAC inhibitors and show altered regulation of genes linked to cancers and neurological diseases.,Stem Cell Res, 2013 Nov,23941963,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23941963/,Genomic abnormalities may accumulate in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during in vitro maintenance. Characterization of the mechanisms enabling survival and expansion of abnormal hESCs is important due to consequences of genetic changes for the therapeutic utilization of stem cells. Furthermore， these cells provide an excellent model to study transformation in vitro. We report here that the histone deacetylase proteins， HDAC1 and HDAC2， are increased in karyotypically abnormal hESCs when compared to their normal counterparts. Importantly， similar to many cancer cell lines， we found that HDAC inhibitors repress proliferation of the karyotypically abnormal hESCs， whereas normal cells are more resistant to the treatment. The decreased proliferation correlates with downregulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins， induction of the proliferation inhibitor， cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A)， and altered regulation of tumor suppressor protein Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Through genome-wide transcriptome analysis we have identified genes with altered expression and responsiveness to HDAC inhibition in abnormal cells. Most of these genes are linked to severe developmental and neurological diseases and cancers. Our results highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of genomic stability of hESCs， and provide valuable candidates for targeted and selective growth inhibition of karyotypically abnormal cells.
AKN-028 induces cell cycle arrest， downregulation of Myc associated genes and dose dependent reduction of tyrosine kinase activity in acute myeloid leukemia.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2014 Jan 15,24200998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24200998/,KN-028 is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)， presently undergoing investigation in a phase I/II study. It is a potent inhibitor of the FMS-like kinase 3 (FLT3) but shows in vitro activity in a wide range of AML samples. In the present study， we have characterized the effects of AKN-028 on AML cells in more detail. AKN-028 induced a dose-dependent G0/1 arrest in AML cell line MV4-11. Treatment with AKN-028 caused significantly altered gene expression in all AML cell types tested (430 downregulated， 280 upregulated transcripts). Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of genes associated with the proto-oncogene and cell cycle regulator c-Myc among the downregulated genes in both AKN-028 and midostaurin treated cells. Kinase activity profiling in AML cell lines and primary AML samples showed that tyrosine kinase activity， but not serine/threonine kinase activity， was inhibited by AKN-028 in a dose dependent manner in all samples tested， reaching approximately the same level of kinase activity. Cells sensitive to AKN-028 showed a higher overall tyrosine kinase activity than more resistant ones， whereas serine/threonine kinase activity was similar for all primary AML samples. In summary， AKN-028 induces cell cycle arrest in AML cells， downregulates Myc-associated genes and affect several signaling pathways. AML cells with high global tyrosine kinase activity seem to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of AKN-028 in vitro.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.govNCT01573247.Keywords:AKN-028; Acute myeloid leukemia; Signal transduction; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
Concomitant BCORL1 and BRAF Mutations in Vemurafenib-Resistant Melanoma Cells.,Neoplasia, 2018 May,29605720,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29605720/,BRAF is the most frequently mutated gene in melanoma. Constitutive activation of mutant BRAFV600Eleads to aberrant Ras-independent MAPK signaling and cell transformation. Inhibition of mutant BRAF is a current frontline therapy for such cases， with improved survival compared with chemotherapy. Unfortunately， reactivation of MAPK signaling by several mechanisms has been shown to cause drug resistance and disease recurrence. In this work， we describe the co-occurrence of an in-frame deletion within an amplified BRAFV600Elocus and a missense point mutation of the transcriptional repressor BCORL1 in vemurafenib-resistant A375 melanoma cells. Functional data confirmed that truncated p47BRAFV600Eand mutant BCORL1Q1076Hboth contribute to resistance. Interestingly， either endogenous BCORL1 silencing or ectopic BCORL1Q1076Hexpression mimicked the effects of a CRISPR/Cas9-edited BCORL1Q1076Hlocus， suggesting a complex mixture of loss- and gain-of-function effects caused by the mutation. Transcriptomic data confirmed this hypothesis. Finally， we show that the pan-RAF inhibitor sorafenib is not affected by expression of BRAF deletion variant and effectively synergizes with vemurafenib to block resistant cells， suggesting a possible intervention for this class of mutants.
Immunogenicity of small-cell lung cancer associates with STING pathway activation and is enhanced by ATR and TOP1 inhibition.,Cancer Med, 2023 Feb,35957613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35957613/,Introduction:The activation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway enhances antitumor immunity in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)， while the DNA damage induced by non-cGAMP-based agonists is a potent inducer of STING activity. Here， we investigate the intrinsic expression of STING in cancer cells and evaluate the value of the combination of ATR and TOP1 inhibitors in enhancing antitumor immunity.Methods:STING expression was assessed at mRNA and protein levels in SCLC and normal lung tissues. Transcriptomic subsets of SCLC were identified based on STING-related genes. Distinct mutation and immunogenomic profiles of these subsets were determined. The direct antitumor efficacy and the potential of enhancing antitumor immunity of the strategy using the ATR-TOP1-inhibitor combination were tested in SCLC cell lines.Results:The intrinsic expression of STING was significantly reduced in SCLC compared to normal lung tissues (p < 0.0001). Three STING-related SCLC subtypes were identified in which the STING-high subtype was associated with (1) high immune infiltration， (2) high expression of genes related to MHC and immune checkpoints， and (3) high EMT and ferroptosis score. On the contrary， the STING-low subtype was enriched with pathways related to DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle progression. The association between the DDR pathway activity and the STING-IFN innate immune response was verified by in vitro experiments in which the inhibition of ATR and TOP1 triggered the expression of genes encoding type I IFN signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in a STING-low SCLC cell line.Conclusion:Our study verifies that activation of the STING-IFN response by ATR and TOP1 inhibitors might be a therapeutic strategy to improve the response to immune checkpoint therapy in STING-low SCLC. Furthermore， the combinations of ATR and TOP1 inhibitors can augment tumor inflammation in STING-low SCLC.Keywords:DNA damage response; cGAS-STING pathway; immune infiltration; small-cell lung cancer; type I IFNs.
Inhibition of Ephrin B3-mediated survival signaling contributes to increased cell death response of non-small cell lung carcinoma cells after combined treatment with ionizing radiation and PKC 412.,Cell Death Dis, 2013 Jan 10,23303128,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23303128/,Radiation therapy is frequently used to treat non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). We have previously shown that a combination of ionizing radiation (IR) and the staurosporine analog PKC 412， but not Ro 31-8220， increases cell death in NSCLC cells. To identify genes involved in the enhancement of cell death， a total gene profiling in response to co-administration of (i) PKC 412 with IR， or (ii) Ro 31-8220 with IR was implemented. These combined treatments caused upregulation of 140 and 179 genes and downregulation of 253 and 425 genes， respectively. Certain genes were selected and verified by real-time quantitative PCR and， of these genes， robust suppression of Ephrin B3 expression was suggested as a possible cell death-inducing mechanism of combined treatment with IR and PKC 412. Indeed， silencing of Ephrin B3 using siRNA in NSCLC cells resulted in a major alteration of their morphology with an elongated phenotype， decreased proliferation and increased cell death signaling. Moreover， silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR caused a decrease in IR-mediated G(2)-arrest， induced cellular senescence， inhibited MAPK ERK and p38 phosphorylation， and caused an upregulation of p27(kip1) expression. Finally， silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR sensitized U-1810 cells to IR-induced apoptosis. In conclusion， we identify and describe Ephrin B3 as a putative signaling molecule involved in the response of NSCLC cells to combined treatment with PKC 412 and ionizing radiation.
Global transcriptomic study of circRNAs expression profile in sorafenib resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,J Cancer, 2020 Mar 4,32226514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32226514/,"The anti-angiogenic drugs represented by sorafenib over the years have always been the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)， but the drug resistance has always been a ""bottleneck"" in curative effect. Recently， aberrant expression of circular RNA (circRNA) is considered to play a crucial role in many types of cancers. However， the genome-wide expression pattern of circRNAs in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells remains unknown. Herein， we identified 1717 differentially expressed circRNAs with 559 up-regulated and 1158 down-regulated (fold change > 2，P< 0.05) in sorafenib-resistant (HUH7-S) HCC cells along with 582 differentially expressed circRNAs with 272 up-regulated and 310 down-regulated (fold change > 2，P< 0.05) in sorafenib-resistant (HepG2-S) HCC cells， compared to parental sorafenib-sensitive (HUH7， HepG2) HCC cells by high-throughput sequencing. In addition， GO (Gene Ontology) term enrichment analysis results revealed an enrichment for binding and catalytic activity and for biological regulation of metabolic processes in both the Huh7-S and HepG2-S cell lines compared to parental cell lines. Moreover， KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes were significantly related to pathways in cancer. Among them， hsa_circ_0006294 and hsa_circ_0035944 expression were consistently down-regulated in resistant HCC cells. Taken together， our data demonstrate， using a global transcriptomic network， that the circRNA expression profile is significantly altered in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and that the differentially expressed circRNAs may play important functions in HCC sorafenib resistance and HCC progression.Keywords:circular RNA; global transcriptomic; hepatocellular carcinoma; sorafenib."
Apoptosis-Inducing and Proliferation-Inhibiting Effects of Doramectin on Mz-ChA-1 Human Cholangiocarcinoma Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2024 Dec 15,39769205,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39769205/,Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that emerges in the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. Doramectin (DOR)， a third-generation derivative of avermectins (AVMs)， is renowned for its low toxicity and high efficiency. However， no research has hitherto focused on the anti-cholangiocarcinoma effects of these drugs. In this study， we undertook a preliminary exploration of the mechanism through which DOR inhibits the viability of human cholangiocarcinoma cells (Mz-ChA-1) via transcriptome analysis and molecular validation at the cellular level. The results indicated that DOR could suppress the growth and proliferation of Mz-ChA-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover， it significantly diminished their migration and invasion abilities. Cell cycle analysis disclosed arrest in the G1 phase， accompanied by an increase in p21 expression and a decrease in the levels of the cyclin E1 and CDK2 proteins. Additionally， DOR induced apoptosis via the ROS-triggered mitochondrial pathway. This was attested by an elevation in the BAX/BCL-2 ratio， the activation of caspase 3/7 and the cleavage of PARP1. These mechanistic insights underscore DOR's potential as a therapeutic agent against cholangiocarcinoma.Keywords:Mz-ChA-1; apoptosis; doramectin; proliferation-inhibiting.
Phenotypic and transcriptional profiling in Entamoeba histolytica reveal costs to fitness and adaptive responses associated with metronidazole resistance.,Front Microbiol, 2015 May 5,25999919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25999919/,ntimicrobial chemotherapy is critical in the fight against infectious diseases caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Among the drugs available for the treatment of amebiasis， metronidazole (MTZ) is considered the drug of choice. Recently， in vitro studies have described MTZ resistance and the potential mechanisms involved. Costs to fitness and adaptive responses associated with resistance， however， have not been investigated. In this study we generated an HM-1 derived strain resistant to 12 μM MTZ (MTZR). We examined its phenotypic and transcriptional profile to determine the consequences and mRNA level changes associated with MTZ resistance. Our results indicated increased cell size and granularity， and decreased rates in cell division， adhesion， phagocytosis， cytopathogenicity， and glucose consumption. Transcriptome analysis revealed 142 differentially expressed genes in MTZR. In contrast to other MTZ resistant parasites， MTZR did not down-regulate pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase， but showed increased expression of genes for a hypothetical protein (HP1) and several iron-sulfur flavoproteins， and downregulation of genes for leucine-rich proteins. Fisher's exact test showed 24 significantly enriched GO terms in MTZR， and a 3-way comparison of modulated genes in MTZR against those of MTZR cultured without MTZ and HM-1 cultured with MTZ， showed that 88 genes were specific to MTZR. Overall， our findings suggested that MTZ resistance is associated with specific transcriptional changes and decreased parasite virulence.Keywords:Entamoeba histolytica; drug resistance; metronidazole; transcriptome.
Baicalin attenuates hepatic injury in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis cell model by suppressing inflammasome-dependent GSDMD-mediated cell pyroptosis.,Int Immunopharmacol, 2020 Apr,32028242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32028242/,Baicalin (BA)， a flavone glycoside， is the constituent of Scutellaria baicalensis， a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However， the mechanism of BA on NASH is still not clear. Here， the improving effect of BA on hepatocyte through inhibition of pyroprosis was investigated in vitro. With a cell model of NASH exposing HepG2 cells in free fatty acids (FFA)， we revealed that BA could improve hepatocyte from FFA-induced morphological damage and death. And then through transcriptomes screening， a significant down-regulation of NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3)， gasdermin D (Gsdmd)， andinterleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) expression were found after BA treatment. Further analysis confirmed that BA could decrease the levels of NLRP3 and GSDMD， as well as the release of IL-1β and IL-18， resulting in the reduction of pyroptosis. Moreover， the improving effect of BA could be attenuated by Gsdmd knockdown. In conclusion， BA can reduce pyroptosis of hepatocyte by blocking NLRP3-GSDMD signaling in vitro.Keywords:Baicalin; GSDMD; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; Pyroptosis.
Pre-Clinical Tools for Predicting Drug Efficacy in Treatment of Tuberculosis.,Microorganisms, 2022 Feb 26,35336089,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35336089/,Combination therapy has， to some extent， been successful in limiting the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Drug combinations achieve this advantage by simultaneously acting on different targets and metabolic pathways. Additionally， drug combination therapies are shown to shorten the duration of therapy for tuberculosis. As new drugs are being developed， to overcome the challenge of finding new and effective drug combinations， systems biology commonly uses approaches that analyse mycobacterial cellular processes. These approaches identify the regulatory networks， metabolic pathways， and signaling programs associated withM. tuberculosisinfection and survival. Different preclinical models that assess anti-tuberculosis drug activity are available， but the combination of models that is most predictive of clinical treatment efficacy remains unclear. In this structured literature review， we appraise the options to accelerate the TB drug development pipeline through the evaluation of preclinical testing assays of drug combinations.Keywords:MDR-TB; drug activity; drug combinations; drug efficacy; high order combinations; in vitro preclinical modelling; synergism; transcriptomics; tuberculosis.
A Comprehensive RNA Study to Identify circRNA and miRNA Biomarkers for Docetaxel Resistance in Breast Cancer.,Front Oncol, 2021 May 14,34055636,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34055636/,To investigate the relationship between non-coding RNAs [especially circular RNAs (circRNAs)] and docetaxel resistance in breast cancer， and to find potential predictive biomarkers for taxane-containing therapies， we have performed transcriptome and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing for two established docetaxel-resistant breast cancer (DRBC) cell lines and their docetaxel-sensitive parental cell lines. Our analyses revealed differences between circRNA signatures in the docetaxel-resistant and -sensitive breast cancer cells， and discovered circRNAs generated by multidrug-resistance genes in taxane-resistant cancer cells. In DRBC cells， circABCB1 was identified and validated as a circRNA that is strongly up-regulated， whereas circEPHA3.1 and circEPHA3.2 are strongly down-regulated. Furthermore， we investigated the potential functions of these circRNAs by bioinformatics analysis， and miRNA analysis was performed to uncover potential interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs. Our data showed that circABCB1， circEPHA3.1 and circEPHA3.2 may sponge up eight significantly differentially expressed miRNAs that are associated with chemotherapy and contribute to docetaxel resistanceviathe PI3K-Akt and AGE-RAGE signaling pathways. We also integrated differential expression data of mRNA， long non-coding RNA， circRNA， and miRNA to gain a global profile of multi-level RNA changes in DRBC cells， and compared them with changes in DNA copy numbers in the same cell lines. We found that Chromosome 7 q21.12-q21.2 was a common region dominated by multi-level RNA overexpression and DNA amplification， indicating that overexpression of the RNA molecules transcribed from this region may result from DNA amplification during stepwise exposure to docetaxel. These findings may help to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying docetaxel resistance in breast cancer.Keywords:RNA sequencing; breast cancer; circRNA; docetaxel resistance; miRNA.
Small molecule inhibition of group I p21-activated kinases in breast cancer induces apoptosis and potentiates the activity of microtubule stabilizing agents.,Breast Cancer Res, 2015 Apr 23,25902869,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25902869/,Introduction:Breast cancer， the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among women， is a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease. Extensive genetic and epigenetic profiling of breast tumors has recently revealed novel putative driver genes， including p21-activated kinase (PAK)1. PAK1 is a serine/threonine kinase downstream of small GTP-binding proteins， Rac1 and Cdc42， and is an integral component of growth factor signaling networks and cellular functions fundamental to tumorigenesis.Methods:PAK1 dysregulation (copy number gain， mRNA and protein expression) was evaluated in two cohorts of breast cancer tissues (n=980 and 1，108). A novel small molecule inhibitor， FRAX1036， and RNA interference were used to examine PAK1 loss of function and combination with docetaxel in vitro. Mechanism of action for the therapeutic combination， both cellular and molecular， was assessed via time-lapse microscopy and immunoblotting.Results:We demonstrate that focal genomic amplification and overexpression of PAK1 are associated with poor clinical outcome in the luminal subtype of breast cancer (P=1.29×10(-4) and P=0.015， respectively). Given the role for PAK1 in regulating cytoskeletal organization， we hypothesized that combination of PAK1 inhibition with taxane treatment could be combined to further interfere with microtubule dynamics and cell survival. Consistent with this， administration of docetaxel with either a novel small molecule inhibitor of group I PAKs， FRAX1036， or PAK1 small interfering RNA oligonucleotides dramatically altered signaling to cytoskeletal-associated proteins， such as stathmin， and induced microtubule disorganization and cellular apoptosis. Live-cell imaging revealed that the duration of mitotic arrest mediated by docetaxel was significantly reduced in the presence of FRAX1036， and this was associated with increased kinetics of apoptosis.Conclusions:Taken together， these findings further support PAK1 as a potential target in breast cancer and suggest combination with taxanes as a viable strategy to increase anti-tumor efficacy.
Overcoming enzalutamide resistance in metastatic prostate cancer by targeting sphingosine kinase.,EBioMedicine, 2021 Oct,34656931,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34656931/,Background:Intrinsic resistance to androgen receptor signalling inhibitors (ARSI) occurs in 20-30% of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Ceramide metabolism may have a role in ARSI resistance. Our study's aim is to investigate the association of the ceramide-sphingosine-1-phosphate (ceramide-S1P) signalling axis with ARSI resistance in mCRPC.Methods:Lipidomic analysis (∼700 lipids) was performed on plasma collected from 132 men with mCRPC， before commencing enzalutamide or abiraterone. AR gene aberrations in 77 of these men were identified by deep sequencing of circulating tumour DNA. Associations between circulating lipids， radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined by Cox regression. Inhibition of ceramide-S1P signalling with sphingosine kinase (SPHK) inhibitors (PF-543 and ABC294640) on enzalutamide efficacy was investigated with in vitro assays， and transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses of prostate cancer (PC) cell lines (LNCaP， C42B， 22Rv1).Findings:Men with elevated circulating ceramide levels had shorter rPFS (HR=2·3， 95% CI=1·5-3·6， p = 0·0004) and shorter OS (HR=2·3， 95% CI=1·4-36， p = 0·0005). The combined presence of an AR aberration with elevated ceramide levels conferred a worse prognosis than the presence of only one or none of these characteristics (median rPFS time = 3·9 vs 8·3 vs 17·7 months; median OS time = 8·9 vs 19·8 vs 34·4 months). SPHK inhibitors enhanced enzalutamide efficacy in PC cell lines. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses indicated that enzalutamide combined with SPHK inhibition enhanced PC cell death by SREBP-induced lipotoxicity.Interpretation:Ceramide-S1P signalling promotes ARSI resistance， which can be reversed with SPHK inhibitors.Funding:None.Keywords:Ceramide; Enzalutamide; Metastatic prostate cancer; Sphingosine kinase.
Microtubule acetylation and PERK activation facilitate eribulin-induced mitochondrial calcium accumulation and cell death.,Cell Mol Life Sci, 2024 Dec 31,39741209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39741209/,Over the past few decades， microtubules have been targeted by various anticancer drugs， including paclitaxel and eribulin. Despite their promising effects， the development of drug resistance remains a challenge. We aimed to define a novel cell death mechanism that targets microtubules using eribulin and to assess its potential in overcoming eribulin resistance. Notably， treating non-resistant breast cancer cells with eribulin led to increased microtubule acetylation around the nucleus and cell death. Conversely， eribulin-resistant (EriR) cells did not exhibit a similar increase in acetylation， even at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Interestingly， silencing the ATAT1 gene， which encodes the α-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (the enzyme responsible for microtubule acetylation)， induces eribulin resistance， mirroring the phenotype of EriR cells. Moreover， eribulin-induced acetylation of microtubules facilitates the transport of Ca2+from the ER to the mitochondria， releasing cytochrome c and subsequent cell death. Transcriptome analysis of EriR cells revealed a significant downregulation of ER stress-induced apoptotic signals， particularly the activity of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)， within the unfolded protein response signaling system. Pharmacological induction of microtubule acetylation through a histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor combined with the activation of PERK signaling using the PERK activator CCT020312 in EriR cells enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+accumulation and subsequent cell death. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which eribulin-induced microtubule acetylation and increased PERK activity lead to Ca2+overload from the ER to the mitochondria， ultimately triggering cell death. This study offers new insights into strategies for overcoming resistance to microtubule-targeting agents.Keywords:Calcium transfer; Drug resistance; ER-mitochondria contact; Eribulin; Microtubule acetylation; PERK signaling.
The regulation of hsacirc_004413 promotes proliferation and drug resistance of gastric cancer cells by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-145-5p.,PeerJ, 2022 Apr 7,35415017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35415017/,Background:Whether circRAN， which acts as a microRNA sponge， plays a role in 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) resistant gastric cancer has not been reported. In this study， a 5-Fu resistant cell line with an IC50 of 16.59 µM was constructed.Methods:Using comparative analysis of circRNA in the transcriptomics of resistant and sensitive strains， 31 differentially expressed circRNAs were detected， and the microRNA interacting with them was predicted.Results:Hsacirc_004413 was selected for verification in drug resistant and sensitive cells. By interfering with hsacirc_004413 using antisense RNA， the sensitivity of drug resistant cells to 5-Fu was significantly promoted， and the apoptosis and necrosis of the cells were significantly increased. In sensitive cells， inhibition by inhibitors enhanced the resistance of cells to 5-Fu. We hypothesize that hsacirc_004413 makes gastric cancer cells resistant to 5-Fu mainly through adsorption of miR-145-5p.Keywords:5-Fu; CircRAN; Drug resistance; Gastric carcinoma cells.
Ciprofol suppresses proliferation， invasion and migration of human pancreatic cancer cells.,Pak J Pharm Sci, 2024 Mar,38767100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38767100/,Pancreatic cancer (PC) is heterogeneous cancer having a high death rate and poor prognosis. The perioperative variables， such as anesthetics， may affect the cancer progression. Ciprofol is an intravenous anesthetic widely used recently. We aimed to explore the influence of ciprofol on PC and investigate its possible pathway. The proliferation， migration and invasion roles and apoptosis of ciprofol in human PC cells were examined using methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide， trans well and flow cytometery analysis. Then the putative targeted genes were examined using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. When differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found， a protein-protein interaction network and pathway analyses were made. Moreover， MMP1 gene expression was confirmed in PC cells using quantitative real-time PCR. PANC-1 cells of PC were significantly suppressed with ciprofol in a dose-dependent and time-dependent way， and 20µg/mL ciprofol significantly suppressed tumor cell aggressiveness. Additionally， the RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that ciprofol controls the expression of 929 DEGs. 5 of 20 hub genes with increased connection were selected. Survival analysis demonstrated that MMP1 may be involved in the carcinogenesis and establishment of PC， reflecting the possible roles associated with ciprofol. Moreover， one target miRNA (hsa-miR-330-5p) of MMP1 was identified.
Effect of 5-fluorouracil on mRNA expression of drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter genes in human hepatoma cell lines.,Biomed Res, 2021,34380920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34380920/,Fluoropyrimidines such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are well known to have drug-drug interactions with anticoagulant medications such as warfarin. This study investigated the mRNA expression of pharmacokinetic (PK)-related genes in response to 5-FU using the hepatocarcinoma cell lines after examining relevant gene expression via RNA sequencing. We used HepaRG cells for 5-FU treatment analysis because these cells displayed PK-related gene expression. 5-FU exposure significantly reduced cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) mRNA expression. Additionally， the mRNA expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 (also known as pregnane X receptor)， a nuclear receptor transcription factor that promotes the expression of many CYP genes， was also decreased in HepaRG cells following 5-FU treatment. The mRNA expressions of the CYP2B6 and ATP-binding cassette transporter genes were decreased after 5-FU treatment. This study revealed that 5-FU treatment reduced PK-related gene expression in HepaRG cells. These findings should be useful for further drug-drug interaction research.
Sorafenib inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition through an epigenetic-based mechanism in human lung epithelial cells.,PLoS One, 2013 May 31,23741434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23741434/,The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been well recognized for many decades as an essential early step in the progression of primary tumors towards metastases. Widespread epigenetic reprogramming of DNA and histone modifications tightly regulates gene expression and cellular activity during carcinogenesis， and epigenetic therapy has been developed to design efficient strategies for cancer treatment. As the first oral agent approved for the clinical treatment of cancer， sorafenib has significant inhibitory effects on tumor growth and EMT. However， a detailed understanding of the underlying epigenetic mechanism remains elusive. In this manuscript， we performed a ChIP-seq assay to evaluate the activity of sorafenib on the genome-wide profiling of histone modifications. We demonstrate that sorafenib largely reverses the changes in histone modifications that occur during EMT in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Sorafenib also significantly reduces the coordinated epigenetic switching of critical EMT-associated genes in accordance with their expression levels. Furthermore， we show that sorafenib potentiates histone acetylation by regulating the expression levels of histone-modifying enzymes. Collectively， these findings provide the first evidence that sorafenib inhibits the EMT process through an epigenetic mechanism， which holds enormous promise for identifying novel epigenetic candidate diagnostic markers and drug targets for the treatment of human malignancies.
Overexpression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and genomic gain of the NQO1 locus modulates breast cancer cell sensitivity to quinones.,Life Sci, 2016 Jan 15,26687450,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26687450/,ims:Alterations in the expression of antioxidant enzymes are associated with changes in cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs (menadione and β-lapachone). Mechanisms of acquisition of resistance to pro-oxidant drugs were investigated using a model of oxidative stress-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Resox cells).Main methods:FISH experiments were performed in tumor biopsy and breast cancer cells to characterize the pattern of the NQO1 gene. SNP-arrays were conducted to detect chromosomal imbalances. Finally， the importance of NQO1 overexpression in the putative acquisition of either drug resistance or an increased sensitivity to quinones by cancer cells was investigated by immunoblotting and cytotoxicity assays.Key findings:Genomic gain of the chromosomal band 16q22 was detected in Resox cells compared to parental breast cancer MCF-7 cells and normal human mammary epithelial 250MK cells. This genomic gain was associated with amplification of the NQO1 gene in one tumor biopsy as well as in breast cancer cell lines. Using different breast cell models， we found that NQO1 overexpression was a main determinant for a potential chemotherapy resistance or an increased sensitivity to quinone-bearing compounds.Significance:Because NQO1 is frequently modified in tumors at genomic and transcriptomic levels， the impact of NQO1 modulation on breast cancer cell sensitivity places NQO1 as a potential link between cancer redox alterations and resistance to chemotherapy. Thus， the NQO1 gene copy number and NQO1 activity should be considered when quinone-bearing molecules are being utilized as potential drugs against breast tumors.Keywords:Breast cancer cells; Genomic gain; Menadione; NQO1; Redox alterations; β-Lapachone.
Cisplatin-mediated down-regulation of miR-145 contributes to up-regulation of PD-L1 via the c-Myc transcription factor in cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells.,Clin Exp Immunol, 2020 Apr,31821542,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31821542/,Immune tolerance is one of the leading causes of chemotherapy resistance in carcinoma cases. Studies have shown that programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)， an inhibitory molecule expressed by cancer cells， plays a significant role in immune tolerance through the induction of T cell dysfunction. The results of our RNA sequencing in previous studies revealed that microRNA-145 (miR-145)， which is known to be down-regulated by cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells， also represses gene PD-L1 expression. However， the mechanism by which miR-145 contributes to regulate PD-L1 expression in cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer is yet to be fully understood. Here， we show that cisplatin-mediated miR-145 down-regulation increased PD-L1 expression via targeting the c-Myc transcription factor， thereby inducing T cell apoptosis in vitro. We also report that expression of miR-145 is negatively correlated with PD-L1 expression in human ovarian cancer tissues， malignant grades and the recurrent risks of ovarian cancer after chemotherapy. In summary， our findings suggest that the miR-145/c-Myc/PD-L1 axis contributes to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer and support that miR-145 might act as an adjuvant therapeutic target in chemotherapy of ovarian cancer.Keywords:PD-L1; c-Myc; cisplatin resistance; microRNA-145; ovarian cancer.

CEACAM6 promotes cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma and is regulated by microRNA-146a and microRNA-26a.,Thorac Cancer, 2020 Sep,32648688,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32648688/,Background:Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is a glycophosphoinositol-anchored glycoprotein which mediates cell-cell interactions. Here， we aimed to explore the specific functions and regulatory mechanisms of CEACAM6 on cisplatin (DDP) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).Methods:RNA sequencing was performed in the DDP-resistant A549/DDP cell line and parental A549 cell line; miRNA expression profiling of the two cell lines was analyzed using GEO data (GSE43249). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were used to investigate the biological function of CEACAM6 in vitro. The expression status and prognostic value of CEACAM6 in LUAD were verified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.Results:CEACAM6 was first screened to be one of the most significantly upregulated genes in the DDP-resistant A549/DDP cell line compared to the parental A549 cell line. Combined with computational prediction of candidate miRNAs that target CEACAM6， miR-146a and miR-26a were selected and verified by qPCR and luciferase reporter assay. The knockdown of CEACAM6 expression in A549/DDP cells inhibited cell proliferation， invasion and migration， decreased the IC50values of DDP， and caused a significant downregulation of N-cadherin， vimentin， Sox2， Oct4 and GTP-RhoA and upregulation of E-cadherin; while CEACAM6 overexpression in A549 cells resulted in the opposite effects. Of note， both miR-146a and miR-26a could counteract the biological effects of CEACAM6.

Zotarolimus alleviates post-trabeculectomy fibrosis via dual functions of anti-inflammation and regulating AMPK/mTOR axis.,Int Immunopharmacol, 2024 Dec 5,39303539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39303539/,Objective:Postoperative scar formation is the primary cause of uncontrolled intraocular pressure following trabeculectomy failure. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of zotarolimus as an adjuvant anti-scarring agent in the experimental trabeculectomy.Methods:We performed differential gene and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis on rabbit follicular transcriptome sequencing data (GSE156781). New Zealand white Rabbits were randomly assigned into three groups: Surgery only， Surgery with mitomycin-C treatment， Surgery with zotarolimus treatment. Rabbits were euthanized 3 days or 28 days post-trabeculectomy. Pathological sections were analyzed using immunohistochemistry， immunofluorescence， and Masson staining. In vitro， primary human tenon's capsule fibroblasts (HTFs) were stimulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and treated with either mitomycin-C or zotarolimus. Cell proliferation and migration were evaluated using cell counting kit-8， cell cycle， and scratch assays. Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected with the JC-1 probe， and reactive oxygen species were detected using the DCFH-DA probe. RNA and protein expressions were quantified using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence.Results:Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed the involvement of complex immune factors and metabolic disorders in trabeculectomy outcomes. Zotarolimus effectively inhibited fibrosis， reduced proinflammatory factor release and immune cell infiltration， and improved the surgical outcomes of trabeculectomy. In TGF-β1-induced HTFs， zotarolimus reduced fibrosis， proliferation， and migration without cytotoxicity via the dual regulation of the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 and AMPK/AKT/mTOR pathways.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that zotarolimus mitigates fibrosis by reducing immune infiltration and correcting metabolic imbalances， offering a potential treatment for improving trabeculectomy surgical outcomes.Keywords:Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK); Anti-fibrosis; Glaucoma; Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); Trabeculectomy; Zotarolimus.

Toll-like receptor 7 agonist GS-9620 induces prolonged inhibition of HBV via a type I interferon-dependent mechanism.,J Hepatol, 2018 May,29247725,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29247725/,Background & aims:GS-9620， an oral agonist of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)， is in clinical development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). GS-9620 was previously shown to induce prolonged suppression of serum viral DNA and antigens in the woodchuck and chimpanzee models of CHB. Herein， we investigated the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the antiviral response to GS-9620 using in vitro models of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Methods:Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and differentiated HepaRG (dHepaRG) cells were infected with HBV and treated with GS-9620， conditioned media from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with GS-9620 (GS-9620 conditioned media [GS-9620-CM])， or other innate immune stimuli. The antiviral and transcriptional response to these agents was determined.Results:GS-9620 had no antiviral activity in HBV-infected PHH， consistent with low level TLR7 mRNA expression in human hepatocytes. In contrast， GS-9620-CM induced prolonged reduction of HBV DNA， RNA， and antigen levels in PHH and dHepaRG cells via a type I interferon (IFN)-dependent mechanism. GS-9620-CM did not reduce covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels in either cell type. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that GS-9620-CM strongly induced various HBV restriction factors - although not APOBEC3A or the Smc5/6 complex - and indicated that established HBV infection does not modulate innate immune sensing or signaling in cryopreserved PHH. GS-9620-CM also induced expression of immunoproteasome subunits and enhanced presentation of an immunodominant viral peptide in HBV-infected PHH.Conclusions:Type I IFN induced by GS-9620 durably suppressed HBV in human hepatocytes without reducing cccDNA levels. Moreover， HBV antigen presentation was enhanced， suggesting additional components of the TLR7-induced immune response played a role in the antiviral response to GS-9620 in animal models of CHB.Lay summary:GS-9620 is a drug currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. GS-9620 has previously been shown to suppress HBV in various animal models， but the underlying antiviral mechanisms were not completely understood. In this study， we determined that GS-9620 does not directly activate antiviral pathways in human liver cells， but can induce prolonged suppression of HBV via induction of an antiviral cytokine called interferon. However， interferon did not destroy the HBV genome， suggesting that other parts of the immune response (e.g. activation of immune cells that kill infected cells) also play an important role in the antiviral response to GS-9620.Keywords:APOBEC; GS-9620; Hepatitis B virus; Immunoproteasome; Interferon-alpha; Interferon-stimulated gene; MHC; Smc5/6; TLR7; cccDNA.

Impact on Glioblastoma U87 Cell Gene Expression of a Carborane Cluster-Bearing Amino Acid: Implications for Carborane Toxicity in Mammalian Cells.,ACS Chem Neurosci, 2019 Mar 20,30475580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30475580/,Carboranes have been extensively investigated as potential drugs for the treatment of malignant human brain tumors by boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This noninvasive treatment modality utilizes compounds containing the nonradioactive isotope10B which has a high propensity to capture slow neutrons. In response， it emits high energy α-particles that kill the cell. We have successfully synthesized a boron delivery agent by installing a boron-rich m-carborane within the amino acid cysteine. Rapid uptake of this compound into U87 glioblastoma cells within 5 min of exposure was observed， and fluorescence microscopy studies showed that it was retained intracellularly after 48 h. In the absence of thermal neutrons， a cytostatic effect in U87 cells was observed at exposures ranging from 1 μM to 1 mM relative to the control， while no change was observed at 1-0.01 μM. Microarray studies unveiled a wide range of unique changes in the gene expression profile of the U87 cells， particularly for the genes associated with cell cycle， which were observed to be greatly suppressed after treatment with the compound. These results were validated by qPCR studies. Although the compound was designed for BNCT， its distinctive impacts on gene regulation reveal that it and other carborane-containing cluster molecules may exert unique heretofore unknown effects on the transcriptome， even in the absence of applied radiation.Keywords:Carborane; apoptosis; boron delivery; cell cycle; cytostatic; unnatural amino acid.
NXPH4 can be used as a biomarker for pan-cancer and promotes colon cancer progression.,Aging (Albany NY), 2024 Apr 12,38613793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38613793/,NXPH4 promotes cancer proliferation and invasion. However， its specific role and mechanism in cancer remain unclear. Transcriptome and clinical data for pan-cancer were derived from the TCGA database. K-M survival curve and univariate Cox were used for prognostic analysis. CIBERSORT and TIMER algorithms were employed to calculate immune cell infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed for investigating the function of NXPH4. Western blot verified differential expression of NXPH4 in colon cancer. Functional assays (CCK-8， plate clonogenicity assay， wound healing assay， and Transwell assay) confirmed the impact of NXPH4 on proliferation， invasion， and migration of colon cancer cells. Dysregulation of NXPH4 in pan-cancer suggests its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for certain cancers， including colon and liver cancer. High expression of NXPH4 in pan-cancer might be associated with the increase in copy number and hypomethylation. NXPH4 expression in pan-cancer is substantially linked to immune cell infiltration in the immune microenvironment. NXPH4 expression is associated with the susceptibility to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Western blot further confirmed the higher expression of NXPH4 in colon cancer. Knockdown of NXPH4 significantly suppresses proliferation， invasion， and migration of colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and HCT116， as validated by functional assays.Keywords:NXPH4; bioinformatics; biomarker; colon cancer; pan-cancer.

Glucose transporter‑1 inhibition overcomes imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells.,Oncol Rep, 2022 Jan,34738628,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34738628/,Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is the primary agent of choice used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). However， drug resistance to imatinib poses a major obstacle to treatment efficacy. In addition， the relationship between imatinib resistance and glycolysis is poorly understood. Glucose transporter (GLUT)‑1 is a key component of glycolysis. The present study aimed to assess the potential relationship between components in the glycolytic pathway and the acquisition of imatinib resistance by GIST cells， with particular focus on GLUT‑1. An imatinib‑resistant GIST cell line was established through the gradual and continuous imatinib treatment of the parental human GIST cell line GIST‑T1. The expression of glycolysis‑related molecules (GLUT‑1， hexokinase 2， pyruvate kinase M2 and lactate dehydrogenase) was assessed in parental and imatinib‑resistant cells by western blotting， reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and glucose and lactate measurement kits. In addition， clinical information and transcriptomic data obtained from the gene expression omnibus database (GSE15966) were used to confirm thein vitroresults. The potential effects of GLUT‑1 inhibition on the expression of proteins in the glycolysis (GLUT‑1， hexokinase 2， pyruvate kinase M2 and lactate dehydrogenase) and apoptosis pathways (Bcl‑2， cleaved PARP， caspase-3 and caspase-9) in imatinib‑resistant cells were then investigated following gene silencing and treatment using the GLUT‑1 inhibitor WZB117 by western blotting. For gene silencing， the mature siRNAs forSLC2A1were used for cell transfection. Annexin V‑FITC/PI double‑staining followed by flow cytometry was used to measure apoptosis whereas three‑dimensional culture experiments were used to create three‑dimensional spheroid cells where cell viability and spheroid diameter were measured. Although imatinib treatment downregulated GLUT‑1 expression and other glycolysis pathway components hexokinase 2， pyruvate kinase M2， and lactate dehydrogenase in parental GIST‑T1 cells even at low concentrations. By contrast， expression of these glycolysis pathway components in imatinib‑resistant cells were increased by imatinib treatment. WZB117 administration significantly downregulated AKT phosphorylation and Bcl‑2 expression in imatinib‑resistant cells， whereas the combined administration of imatinib and WZB117 conferred synergistic growth inhibition effects in apoptosis assay. WZB117 was found to exert additional inhibitory effects by inducing apoptosis in imatinib‑resistant cells. Therefore， the present study suggests that GLUT‑1 is involved in the acquisition of imatinib resistance by GIST cells， which can be overcome by combined treatment with WZB117 and imatinib.Keywords:WZB117; Warburg effect; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; glucose transporter‑1; imatinib.

Elevated phosphorylation of EGFR in NSCLC due to mutations in PTPRH.,PLoS Genet, 2022 Sep 2,36054194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36054194/,The role of EGFR in lung cancer is well described with numerous activating mutations that result in phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target EGFR. While the role of the EGFR kinase in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is appreciated， control of EGFR signaling pathways through dephosphorylation by phosphatases is not as clear. Through whole genome sequencing we have uncovered conserved V483M Ptprh mutations in PyMT induced tumors. Profiling the downstream events of Ptprh mutant tumors revealed AKT activation， suggesting a key target of PTPRH was EGFR tyrosine 1197. Given the role of EGFR in lung cancer， we explored TCGA data which revealed that a subset of PTPRH mutant tumors shared gene expression profiles with EGFR mutant tumors， but that EGFR mutations and PTPRH mutations were mutually exclusive. Generation of a PTPRH knockout NSCLC cell line resulted in Y1197 phosphorylation of EGFR， and a rescue with expression of wild type PTPRH returned EGFR phosphorylation to parental line values while rescue with catalytically dead PTPRH did not. A dose response curve illustrated that two human NSCLC lines with naturally occurring PTPRH mutations responded to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. Osimertinib treatment of these tumors resulted in a reduction of tumor volume relative to vehicle controls. PTPRH mutation resulted in nuclear pEGFR as seen in immunohistochemistry， suggesting that there may also be a role for EGFR as a transcriptional co-factor. Together these data suggest mutations in PTPRH in NSCLC is inhibitory to PTPRH function， resulting in aberrant EGFR activity and ultimately may result in clinically actionable alterations using existing therapies.

Acyl-CoA synthetase-4 is implicated in drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines involving the regulation of energy-dependent transporter expression.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2019 Jan,30414939,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414939/,yl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) is an enzyme implicated in estrogen receptor α (ERα) negative regulation and hormone therapy resistance in breast cancer. In addition， ACSL4 has been associated to certain types of hormone resistance in prostate cancer. Chemotherapeutic treatment of disseminated breast cancer is usually faced with therapy resistance associated to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter expression， which detect and eject anti-cancer drugs from cells. In this context， the aim of the present work was to study the role of ACSL4 in anti-cancer drug resistance and the involvement of ABC transporters in the underlying mechanisms. To this end， we used MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 and MDA-MB-231 mock cells， which overexpress ACSL4， and control line MCF-7 Tet-Off empty vector， MDA-MB-231 shRNA ACSL4 and MDA-MB-231 wild type cells. Assays were conducted on cell viability (MTT)， cell proliferation (BrdU)， drug efflux (flow cytometry)， ACSL4-responsive drug resistance ABC transporter genes (RNA-Seq)， transporter mRNA expression， protein levels and signaling pathway participation (real-time PCR and Western blot). Higher survival rates upon chemotherapeutic treatment were obtained in MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 and MDA-MB-231 mock cells， an effect counteracted by doxycycline- or shRNA-induced ACSL4 inhibition， respectively. A synergic effect of ACSL4 inhibitor triacsin C and chemotherapeutic drugs was observed on the inhibition of MDA-MB-231 wild type cell proliferation. MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 cells showed greater doxorubicin， Hoechst 33342 and calcein AM efflux. In contrast， MDA-MB-231 shRNA ACSL4 cells evidenced inhibition of chemotherapeutic drug efflux. ABCG2， ABCC4， and ABCC8 were identified as ACSL4-responsive drug resistance genes whose expression was increased in MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 cells but inhibited in MDA-MB-231 shRNA ACSL4 cells. Further cell survival assays in the presence of Ko 143 and Ceefourin 1， inhibitors of ABCG2 and ABCC4， respectively， upon chemotherapeutic treatment showed greater participation of ABCG2 in anti-cancer drug resistance in cells overexpressing ACSL4. In addition， ACSL4 inhibition and chemotherapeutic treatment combined with rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition synergically inhibited proliferation and reduced ABCG2 expression in cells overexpressing ACSL4. In sum， ACSL4 may be regarded as a novel therapeutic target regulating the expression of transporters involved in anticancer drug resistance through the mTOR pathway to restore drug sensitivity in tumors with poor prognosis for disease-free and overall survival.Keywords:ABC transporter; ACSL4; Breast cancer; Chemotherapeutic drug resistance; mTOR pathway.
Androcin 18-1， a novel scorpion-venom peptide， shows a potent antitumor activity against human U87 cells via inducing mitochondrial dysfunction.,Insect Biochem Mol Biol, 2024 Jul,38759703,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38759703/,Scorpion venom is a potent natural source for antitumor drug development due to the multiple action modes of anticancer components. Although the sequence of Androcin 18-1 has been identified from the transcriptome profile of the scorpion venom Androctonus bicolor， its bioactivity remains unclear. In this study， we described the antitumor mechanism whereby Androcin 18-1 inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis by inducing cell membrane disruption， ROS accumulation， and mitochondrial dysfunction in human U87 glioblastoma cells. Moreover， Androcin 18-1 could suppress cell migration via the mechanisms associated with cytoskeleton disorganization and MMPs/TIMPs expression regulation. The discovery of this work highlights the potential application of Androcin 18-1 in drug development for glioblastoma treatment.Keywords:Androcin 18−1; Anticancer peptide; Membranolysis; Mitochondrial dysfunction.
The safety and efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil， a novel anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy， in HIV-infected adults: a randomized， double-blind， placebo-controlled trial.,J Infect Dis, 1997 Dec,9395363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9395363/,defovir dipivoxil is a novel nucleotide analogue with several promising in vitro anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) characteristics. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy， a randomized， double-blind， placebo-controlled study was initiated involving 72 subjects with moderately advanced HIV disease. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive adefovir dipivoxil or placebo as a once-daily oral dose for 6 weeks， followed by 6 weeks of open-label adefovir dipivoxil. Two dose levels were studied (125 mg and 250 mg). Adefovir dipivoxil was determined to be safe and well-tolerated when administered for 12 weeks. At week 6， changes in absolute CD4 T cell levels and HIV-1 RNA levels were significantly greater with adefovir dipivoxil than with placebo. These effects were sustained through 12 weeks of treatment. As determined by standard RNA sequencing techniques， only 1 of the 24 subjects who received adefovir dipivoxil (125 mg/day) developed any genotypic change from baseline.
Rapid， cell-based toxicity screen of potentially therapeutic post-transcriptional gene silencing agents.,Exp Eye Res, 2011 May,21256844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256844/,Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) agents such as antisense， ribozymes and RNA interference (RNAi) have great potential as therapeutics for a variety of eye diseases including retinal and macular degenerations， glaucoma， corneal degenerations， inflammatory and viral conditions. Despite their great potential and over thirty years of academic and corporate research only a single PTGS agent is currently approved for human therapy for a single disease. Substantial challenges exist to achieving both efficacious and safe PTGS agents. Efficacy， as measured in specific target mRNA and protein knockdown， depends upon a number of complex factors including the identification of rare regions of target mRNA accessibility， cellular co-localization of the PTGS agent in sufficient concentration with the target mRNA， and stability of the PTGS agent in the target cells in which it is delivered or expressed. Safety is commonly measured by lack of cytotoxicity or other deleterious cellular responses in cells in which the PTGS agent is delivered or expressed. To relieve major bottlenecks in RNA drug discovery novel， efficient， inexpensive， and rapid tools are needed to facilitate lead identification of the most efficacious PTGS agent， rational optimization of efficacy of the lead agent， and lead agent safety determinations. We have developed a technological platform using cell culture expression systems that permits lead identification and efficacy optimization of PTGS agents against arbitrary disease target mRNAs under relatively high throughput conditions. Here， we extend the technology platform to include PTGS safety determinations in cultured human cells that are expected to represent the common cellular housekeeping microenvironment. We developed a high throughput screening (HTS) cytotoxicity assay in 96-well plate format based around the SYTOX Green dye which is excluded from healthy viable cells and becomes substantially fluorescent only after entering cells and binding to nuclear DNA. In this format we can test a number of PTGS agents for cellular toxicity relative to control elements. We also developed an HTS 96-well plate assay that allows us to assess the impact of any given PTGS agent on stimulating a variety of common cellular stress signaling pathways (e.g. CRE， SRE， AP-1， NFκB， Myc， and NFAT) that could indicate possible deleterious effects of PTGS agents either dependent or independent of base pairing complementarity with target mRNAs. To this end we exploited the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) Pathway Profiling System where the expression of the secreted reporter protein is coupled to transcriptional activation of a variety of promoter elements involved in common cell signaling pathways. We found that a variety of lead hammerhead ribozyme (hhRz) and short hairpin (shRNA) expression constructs did not exert cytotoxicity in human cells when driven by highly active RNA Pol-III promoters. We also found that most of the cell signaling pathways tested (CRE， SRE， Myc， and NFAT) did not significantly couple through upregulation to expression of the set of PTGS agents tested. AP-1 and NFκB upregulation both appear to couple to the expression of some PTGS agents which likely reflect the known properties of these pathways to be stimulated by abundant small structured RNAs.
Acidic/Alkaline Stress Mediates Responses to Azole Drugs and Oxidative Stress in Aspergillus fumigatus.,Microbiol Spectr, 2022 Feb 23,35196814,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35196814/, human host exploits stresses such as acidic/alkaline pH， antifungal drugs， and reactive oxygen species to kill microbial pathogens such as the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. However， A. fumigatus is resistant to these stressesin vitro. Therefore， what accounts for the potent antifungal activity of the human host? In this observation， we show that simultaneous exposure to acidic pH and oxidative stresses is much more potent than the individual stresses themselves and that this combinatorial stress kills A. fumigatus synergisticallyin vitro. Interestingly， A. fumigatus is resistant to the combination of alkaline pH and oxidative stress. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that acidic/alkaline pH stress can mediate oxidative stress responses in A. fumigatus by regulating the expression of catalase-encoding genes. We further show that A. fumigatus is sensitive to the combination of acidic/alkaline stress and azole drug stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the sensitivity of A. fumigatus to azole drugs under acidic/alkaline conditions may be related to changes in genetic stability， sphingolipid metabolism， lipid metabolism， and amino acid metabolism. Collectively， our findings suggest that combinatorial stress represents a powerful fungicidal mechanism employed by hosts against pathogens， which suggests novel approaches to potentiate antifungal therapy.IMPORTANCEThe human host combats fungal infections via phagocytic cells that recognize and kill fungal pathogens. Immune cells combat Aspergillus fumigatus infections with a potent mixture of chemicals， including reactive oxygen species， acidic/alkaline stress， and antifungal drugs. However， A. fumigatus is relatively resistant to these stressesin vitro. In this observation， we show that it is the combination of acidic/alkaline pH and oxidative or azole stress that kills A. fumigatus so effectively， and we define the molecular mechanisms that underlie this potency. Our findings suggest that combinatorial stress is a powerful fungicidal mechanism employed by hosts， which suggests novel approaches to potentiate antifungal therapy. This study provides a platform for future studies that will address the combinatorial impacts of various environmental stresses on A. fumigatus and other pathogenic microbes.Keywords:Aspergillus fumigatus; acidic/alkaline; azole drugs; oxidative stress.
Role of uL3 in the Crosstalk between Nucleolar Stress and Autophagy in Colon Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2020 Mar 20,32244996,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32244996/,The nucleolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis and has been recently described as important sensor for a variety of cellular stressors. In the last two decades， it has been largely demonstrated that many chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting early or late rRNA processing steps with consequent alteration of ribosome biogenesis and activation of nucleolar stress response. The overall result is cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death of cancer cells. Our previously data demonstrated that ribosomal protein uL3 is a key sensor of nucleolar stress activated by common chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells lacking p53. We have also demonstrated that uL3 status is associated to chemoresistance; down-regulation of uL3 makes some chemotherapeutic drugs ineffective. Here， we demonstrate that in colon cancer cells， the uL3 status affects rRNA synthesis and processing with consequent activation of uL3-mediated nucleolar stress pathway. Transcriptome analysis of HCT 116p53-/-cells expressing uL3 and of a cell sub line stably depleted of uL3 treated with Actinomycin D suggests a new extra-ribosomal role of uL3 in the regulation of autophagic process. By using confocal microscopy and Western blotting experiments， we demonstrated that uL3 acts as inhibitory factor of autophagic process; the absence of uL3 is associated to increase of autophagic flux and to chemoresistance. Furthermore， experiments conducted in presence of chloroquine， a known inhibitor of autophagy， indicate a role of uL3 in chloroquine-mediated inhibition of autophagy. On the basis of these results and our previous findings， we hypothesize that the absence of uL3 in cancer cells might inhibit cancer cell response to drug treatment through the activation of cytoprotective autophagy. The restoration of uL3 could enhance the activity of many drugs thanks to its pro-apoptotic and anti-autophagic activity.Keywords:autophagy; cancer; chemotherapy; nucleolar stress; nucleolus; p53; ribosomal proteins; uL3.
Therapeutic Targeting of KDM1A/LSD1 in Ewing Sarcoma with SP-2509 Engages the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2018 Sep,29997151,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29997151/,Multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimes remain the cornerstone treatment for Ewing sarcoma， the second most common bone malignancy diagnosed in pediatric and young adolescent populations. We have reached a therapeutic ceiling with conventional cytotoxic agents， highlighting the need to adopt novel approaches that specifically target the drivers of Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis. As KDM1A/lysine-specificdemethylase 1 (LSD1) is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and tumors， with elevated expression levels associated with worse overall survival (P= 0.033)， this study has examined biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of cytotoxicity to targetedKDM1Ainhibition using SP-2509 (reversibleKDM1Ainhibitor). We report， that innate resistance to SP-2509 was not observed in our Ewing sarcoma cell line cohort (n= 17; IC50range， 81 -1，593 nmol/L)， in contrast resistance to the next-generationKDM1Airreversible inhibitor GSK-LSD1 was observed across multiple cell lines (IC50> 300 μmol/L). AlthoughTP53/STAG2/CDKN2Astatus and basal KDM1A mRNA and protein levels did not correlate with SP-2509 response， induction of KDM1B following SP-2509 treatment was strongly associated with SP-2509 hypersensitivity. We show that the transcriptional profile driven by SP-2509 strongly mirrorsKDM1Agenetic depletion. Mechanistically， RNA-seq analysis revealed that SP-2509 imparts robust apoptosis through engagement of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. In addition，ETS1/HIST1H2BMwere specifically induced/repressed， respectively following SP-2509 treatment only in our hypersensitive cell lines. Together， our findings provide key insights into the mechanisms of SP-2509 cytotoxicity as well as biomarkers that can be used to predictKDM1Ainhibitor sensitivity in Ewing sarcoma.Mol Cancer Ther; 17(9); 1902-16. ©2018 AACR.
Predicting individual-specific cardiotoxicity responses induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,Front Pharmacol, 2023 Apr 10,37101545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37101545/,Introduction:Tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (TKIs) are highly effective cancer drugs， yet many TKIs are associated with various forms of cardiotoxicity. The mechanisms underlying these drug-induced adverse events remain poorly understood. We studied mechanisms of TKI-induced cardiotoxicity by integrating several complementary approaches， including comprehensive transcriptomics， mechanistic mathematical modeling， and physiological assays in cultured human cardiac myocytes.Methods:Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two healthy donors were differentiated into cardiac myocytes (iPSC-CMs)， and cells were treated with a panel of 26 FDA-approved TKIs. Drug-induced changes in gene expression were quantified using mRNA-seq， changes in gene expression were integrated into a mechanistic mathematical model of electrophysiology and contraction， and simulation results were used to predict physiological outcomes.Results:Experimental recordings of action potentials， intracellular calcium， and contraction in iPSC-CMs demonstrated that modeling predictions were accurate， with 81% of modeling predictions across the two cell lines confirmed experimentally. Surprisingly， simulations of how TKI-treated iPSC-CMs would respond to an additional arrhythmogenic insult， namely， hypokalemia， predicted dramatic differences between cell lines in how drugs affected arrhythmia susceptibility， and these predictions were confirmed experimentally. Computational analysis revealed that differences between cell lines in the upregulation or downregulation of particular ion channels could explain how TKI-treated cells responded differently to hypokalemia.Discussion:Overall， the study identifies transcriptional mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicity caused by TKIs， and illustrates a novel approach for integrating transcriptomics with mechanistic mathematical models to generate experimentally testable， individual-specific predictions of adverse event risk.Keywords:IPSC-CM cardiomyocytes; cardiotoxicity; kinase inhibitor; mRNA sequencing; mRNASeq; mathematical model.
Development of Bovine Gastric Organoids as a Novel In Vitro Model to Study Host-Parasite Interactions in Gastrointestinal Nematode Infections.,Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2022 Jun 30,35846775,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35846775/,Gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) parasites are a major cause of production losses in grazing cattle， primarily through reduced growth rates in young animals. Control of these parasites relies heavily on anthelmintic drugs; however， with growing reports of resistance to currently available anthelmintics， alternative methods of control are required. A major hurdle in this work has been the lack of physiologically relevantin vitroinfection models that has made studying precise interactions between the host and the GINs difficult. Such mechanistic insights into the infection process will be valuable for the development of novel targets for drugs， vaccines， or other interventions. Here we created bovine gastric epithelial organoids from abomasal gastric tissue and studied their application asin vitromodels for understanding host invasion by GIN parasites. Transcriptomic analysis of gastric organoids across multiple passages and the corresponding abomasal tissue showed conserved expression of tissue-specific genes across samples， demonstrating that the organoids are representative of bovine gastric tissue from which they were derived. We also show that self-renewing and self-organising three-dimensional organoids can also be serially passaged， cryopreserved， and resuscitated. UsingOstertagia ostertagi， the most pathogenic gastric parasite in cattle in temperate regions， we show that cattle gastric organoids are biologically relevant models for studying GIN invasion in the bovine abomasum. Within 24 h of exposure， exsheathed larvae rapidly and repeatedly infiltrated the lumen of the organoids. Prior to invasion by the parasites， the abomasal organoids rapidly expanded， developing a 'ballooning' phenotype. Ballooning of the organoids could also be induced in response to exposure to parasite excretory/secretory products. In summary， we demonstrate the power of using abomasal organoids as a physiologically relevantin vitromodel system to study interactions ofO. ostertagiand other GIN with bovine gastrointestinal epithelium.Keywords:Ostertagia ostertagi; gastrointestinal; host-pathogen interactions; nematodes; three-dimensional (3D) organoids; tissue remodelling.
Integrated ceRNAs regulating relationship and bioinformatics analysis to study the molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of puerarin on bladder cancer cell.,J Asian Nat Prod Res, 2025 Mar,39133645,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39133645/,Based on previous experiments， we demonstrated puerarin inhibited the proliferation of BC T24 cells.

Chromatin accessibility analysis reveals that TFAP2A promotes angiogenesis in acquired resistance to anlotinib in lung cancer cells.,Acta Pharmacol Sin, 2020 Oct,32415222,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32415222/,nlotinib， a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor， is effective as a third-line treatment against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However， acquired resistance occurs during its administration. To understand the molecular mechanisms of anlotinib resistance， we characterized chromatin accessibility in both the parental and anlotinib-resistant lung cancer cell line NCI-H1975 through ATAC-seq. Compared with the parental cells， we identified 2666 genomic regions with greater accessibility in anlotinib-resistant cells， in which angiogenesis-related processes and the motifs of 21 transcription factors were enriched. Among these transcription factors， TFAP2A was upregulated. TFAP2A knockdown robustly diminished tumor-induced angiogenesis and partially rescued the anti-angiogenic activity of anlotinib. Furthermore， transcriptome analysis indicated that 2280 genes were downregulated in anlotinib-resistant cells with TFAP2A knocked down， among which the PDGFR， TGF-β， and VEGFR signaling pathways were enriched. Meanwhile， we demonstrated that TFAP2A binds to accessible sites within BMP4 and HSPG2. Collectively， this study suggests that TFAP2A accelerates anlotinib resistance by promoting tumor-induced angiogenesis.Keywords:ATAC-seq; TFAP2A; acquired resistance; anlotinib; non-small cell lung cancer.
Progesterone administration for luteal phase deficiency in human reproduction: an old or new issue?,J Ovarian Res, 2015 Nov 19,26585269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26585269/,Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) is described as a condition of insufficient progesterone exposure to maintain a regular secretory endometrium and allow for normal embryo implantation and growth. Recently， scientific focus is turning to understand the physiology of implantation， in particular the several molecular markers of endometrial competence， through the recent transcriptomic approaches and microarray technology. In spite of the wide availability of clinical and instrumental methods for assessing endometrial competence， reproducible and reliable diagnostic tests for LPD are currently lacking， so no type-IA evidence has been proposed by the main scientific societies for assessing endometrial competence in infertile couples. Nevertheless， LPD is a very common condition that may occur during a series of clinical conditions， and during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and hyperstimulation (COH) programs. In many cases， the correct approach to treat LPD is the identification and correction of any underlying condition while， in case of no underlying dysfunction， the treatment becomes empiric. To date， no direct data is available regarding the efficacy of luteal phase support for improving fertility in spontaneous cycles or in non-gonadotropin induced ovulatory cycles. On the contrary， in gonadotropin in vitro fertilization (IVF) and non-IVF cycles， LPD is always present and progesterone exerts a significant positive effect on reproductive outcomes. The scientific debate still remains open regarding progesterone administration protocols， specially on routes of administration， dose and timing and the potential association with other drugs， and further research is still needed.
The Molecular Context of Vulnerability for CDK9 Suppression in Triple Wild-Type Melanoma.,J Invest Dermatol, 2021 Aug,33745909,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33745909/,pproximately half of melanoma tumors lack a druggable target and are unresponsive to current targeted therapeutics. One proposed approach for treating these therapeutically orphaned tumors is by targeting transcriptional dependencies (oncogene starvation)， whereby survival factors are depleted through inhibition of transcriptional regulators. A drug screen identified a CDK9 inhibitor (SNS-032) to have therapeutic selectivity against wild-type (wt) BRAFwt/NRASwtmelanomas compared with BRAFmut/NRASmutmutated melanomas. We then used two strategies to inhibit CDK9 in vitro-a CDK9 degrader (TS-032) and a selective CDK9 kinase inhibitor (NVP-2). At 500 nM， both TS-032 and NVP-2 demonstrated greater suppression of BRAFwt/NRASwt/NF1wtcutaneous and uveal melanomas than mutant melanomas. RNA sequencing analysis of eight melanoma lines with NVP-2 treatment demonstrated that the context of this vulnerability appears to converge on a cell cycle network that includes many transcriptional regulators， such as the E2F family members. The Cancer Genome Atlas human melanoma tumor data further supported a potential oncogenic role for E2F1 and E2F2 in BRAFwt/NRASwt/NF1wttumors and a direct link to CDK9. Our results suggest that transcriptional blockade through selective targeting of CDK9 is an effective method of suppressing therapeutically orphaned BRAF/NRAS/NF1 wt melanomas.
Linc-ROR promotes the progression of breast cancer and decreases the sensitivity to rapamycin through miR-194-3p targeting MECP2.,Mol Oncol, 2020 Sep,32335998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32335998/,linc-ROR is reported to be a potential biomarker of breast cancer， but the detailed mechanism of linc-ROR-mediated breast cancer regulation has not been fully studied. We aimed to explore how linc-ROR affects proliferation， metastasis， and drug sensitivity in breast cancer. Cell lines in which linc-ROR was overexpressed or knocked down were constructed， and the cell proliferation， colony formation， cell migration， and invasion abilities of these lines were explored. A CCK-8 assay was performed to determine the sensitivity of the breast cancer cells to rapamycin. Next-generation sequencing was conducted to explore the detailed regulatory mechanism of linc-ROR; differentially expressed RNAs in the linc-ROR-overexpressing cell line compared with the negative control were screened out， and their target genes were chosen to perform Gene Ontology analysis， Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis， protein-protein interaction network analysis， and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network analysis. The ceRNA mechanism of linc-ROR for miR-194-3p， which targets MECP2， was determined through dual-luciferase reporter assay， RT-qPCR， western blot， and rescue experiments. Finally， we found that linc-ROR was upregulated in breast tumor tissues. linc-ROR promoted the cell proliferation， colony formation， cell migration， and invasion of breast cancer and decreased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to rapamycin. The overexpression of linc-ROR triggered changes in the whole transcriptome of breast cancer cells， and a total of 85 lncRNAs， 414 microRNAs， 490 mRNAs， and 92 circRNAs were differentially expressed in the linc-ROR-overexpressing cell line compared with the negative control. Through a series of bioinformatic analyses， the 'linc-ROR/miR-194-3p/MECP2' ceRNA regulatory axis was confirmed to be involved in the linc-ROR-mediated progression and drug sensitivity of breast cancer. In conclusion， linc-ROR serves as an onco-lncRNA in breast cancer and promotes the survival of breast cancer cells during rapamycin treatment by functioning as a ceRNA sponge for miR-194-3p， which targets MECP2.Keywords:breast cancer; ceRNA; linc-ROR; next-generation sequencing; rapamycin.
Polygonum barbatum extract reduces colorectal cancer cell proliferation， migration， invasion， and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via YAP and β-catenin pathway regulation.,Sci Rep, 2023 Oct 26,37884620,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37884620/,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide with novel therapeutic developmental challenges. Polygonum barbatum has anticancer potential， but its mechanism(s) are unclear. This study investigates the inhibitory effect of P. barbatum on human CRC cells. Polygonum barbatum extract (PBE) and quercetin standard HPLC fingerprints were determined using analytical RP-HPLC and evaluations were completed using the human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 (KRASG13Dmutation) and HT-29 (BRAF mutation) cells. Post-PBE treatment， cell viability， colony formation， migration， invasion， and apoptosis， as well as changes in the whole-transcriptome of cells were analyzed. PBE significantly reduced CRC cell growth， migration， and invasion， and the genes responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization， cell motility， and cell growth were suppressed by PBE. The differentially expressed genes revealed that PBE treatment exerted a significant effect on the ECM interaction and focal adhesion pathways. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers， N-cadherin， vimentin， SLUG， and SNAIL， were shown to be regulated by PBE. These effects were associated with blockade of the Yes-associated protein and the GSK3β/β-catenin axis. PBE exerts a significant inhibitory effect on CRC cells and may be applicable in clinical trials.
Titanium Tackles the Endoplasmic Reticulum: A First Genomic Study on a Titanium Anticancer Metallodrug.,iScience, 2020 Jul 24,32585595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32585595/,PhenolaTi is an advanced non-toxic anticancer chemotherapy; this inert bis(phenolato)bis(alkoxo) Ti(IV) complex demonstrates the intriguing combination of high and wide efficacy with no detected toxicity in animals. Here we unravel the cellular pathways involved in its mechanism of action by a first genome study on Ti(IV)-treated cells， using an attuned RNA sequencing-based available technology. First， phenolaTi induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in MCF7 cells. Second， the transcriptome of the treated cells was analyzed， identifying alterations in pathways relating to protein translation， DNA damage， and mitochondrial eruption. Unlike for common metallodrugs， electrophoresis assay showed no inhibition of DNA polymerase activity. Reduced in vitro cytotoxicity with added endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor supported the ER as a putative cellular target. Altogether， this paper reveals a distinct ER-related mechanism by the Ti(IV) anticancer coordination complex， paving the way for wider applicability of related techniques in mechanistic analyses of metallodrugs.Keywords:Biochemistry; Cancer; Genomics; Organometallic Chemistry.
A pyridinesulfonamide derivative FD268 suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis via inhibiting PI3K pathway in acute myeloid leukemia.,PLoS One, 2022 Nov 22,36413544,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36413544/,erration of PI3K signaling pathway has been confirmed to be associated with several hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FD268， a pyridinesulfonamide derivative characterized by the conjugation of 7-azaindole group， is a newly identified PI3K inhibitor showing high potent enzyme activity at nanomole concentration. In this study， we demonstrated that FD268 dose-dependently inhibits survival of AML cells with the efficacy superior to that of PI-103 (pan-PI3K inhibitor) and CAL-101 (selective PI3Kδ inhibitor) in the tested HL-60， MOLM-16， Mv-4-11， EOL-1 and KG-1 cell lines. Further mechanistic studies focused on HL-60 revealed that FD268 significantly inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway， promotes the activation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad and downregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1， thus suppressing the cell proliferation and inducing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. The bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome sequencing data also indicated a potential involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These studies indicated that FD268 possesses high potent activity toward AML cells via inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway， which sheds some light on the pyridinesulfonamide scaffold for further optimization and investigation.
γ-tocotrienol regulates gastric cancer by targeting notch signaling pathway.,Hereditas, 2023 Apr 13,37055846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37055846/,Background:Gastric cancer is a common cause of death from cancer and an important global health care issue. Consequently， there is an urgent need to find new drugs and therapeutic targets for the treatment of gastric cancer. Recent studies have shown that tocotrienols (T3) have significant anticancer ability in cancer cell lines. Our previous study found that γ-tocotrienol (γ-T3) induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. We further explored the possible mechanisms of γ-T3 therapy for gastric cancer.Methods:In this study， we treated gastric cancer cells with γ-T3， collect and deposit the cells. γ-T3-treated gastric cancer cells group and untreated group were subjected to RNA-seq assay， and analysis of sequencing results.Results:Consistent with our previous findings， the results suggest that γ-T3 can inhibit mitochondrial complexes and oxidative phosphorylation. Analysis reveals that γ-T3 has altered mRNA and ncRNA in gastric cancer cells. Significantly altered signaling pathways after γ-T3 treatment were enriched for human papillomavirus infection (HPV) pathway and notch signaling pathway. The same significantly down-regulated genes notch1 and notch2 were present in both pathways in γ-T3-treated gastric cancer cells compared to controls.Conclusions:It is indicated that γ-T3 may cure gastric cancer by inhibiting the notch signaling pathway. To provide a new and powerful basis for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer.Keywords:Gastric cancer; Mitochondria; Notch signaling pathway; Oxidative phosphorylation; γ-tocotrienol.
Synergizing Anti-Cancer Drug Combinations With Dual-View Hypergraph Representation Fusion.,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform, 2024 Dec 5,40030495,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40030495/,Drug combination therapy plays a vital role in disease treatment， including cancer， as it contributes to treatment efficacy and can alleviate the effect of drug resistance. Although clinical trials and screening may provide valuable information about synergistic drug combinations， they suffer from challenging combinatorial space. Multiple methods are proposed to address those issues. However， they still fail in making full use of global and local triplet context relationships of known synergistic combinations. To this end， a deep learning model which leverages dual view hypergraph representation fusion for synergistic drug combinations identification is proposed， namely DVHSyn. It first extracts the transcriptome features of cancer cell lines and molecular structures of drugs. Subsequently， by modeling the synergistic effect on a hypergraph， DVHSyn simultaneously learns the local and global context of the sample triplets via a hypergraph view and its expanded heterogeneous graph view. Finally， the learned representations of the above two branches are fused selectively to predict synergistic drug combinations. Experiment results demonstrate that DVHSyn surpasses six other competing methods. One case study also reflects that DVHSyn has the potential to predict novel synergistic drug combinations. Overall， our method is effective in identifying synergistic drug combinations and provides new insights for novel drug development.
Targeting LEF1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition reverses lenvatinib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Invest New Drugs, 2024 Apr,38372948,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38372948/,quired resistance is a significant hindrance to clinical application of lenvatinib in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Further in-depth investigation of resistance mechanisms can help to develop additional therapeutic strategies to overcome or delay resistance. In our study， two lenvatinib-resistant (LR) HCC cell lines were established by treatment with gradient increasing concentration of lenvatinib， named Hep3B-LR and HepG2-LR. Interestingly， continuous lenvatinib treatment reinforced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)， cell migration， and cell invasion. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) enrichment analysis of RNA-sequencing from Hep3B-LR and corresponding parental cells revealed that activation of Wnt signaling pathway was involved in this adaptive process. Active β-catenin and its downstream target lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) were significantly elevated in LR HCC cells， which promoted lenvatinib resistance through mediating EMT-related genes. Data analysis based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) databases suggests that LEF1， as a key regulator of EMT， was a novel molecular target linked to lenvatinib resistance and poor prognosis in HCC. Using a small-molecule specific inhibitor ICG001 and knocking down LEF1 showed that targeting LEF1 restored the sensitivity of LR HCC cells to lenvatinib. Our results uncover upregulation of LEF1 confers lenvatinib resistance by facilitating EMT， cell migration， and invasion of LR HCC cells， indicating that LEF1 is a novel therapeutic target for overcoming acquired lenvatinib resistance.Keywords:Cell migration and cell invasion; EMT; LEF1; Lenvatinib resistance.
Meclofenamate causes loss of cellular tethering and decoupling of functional networks in glioblastoma.,Neuro Oncol, 2021 Nov 2,33864086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33864086/,Background:Glioblastoma cells assemble to a syncytial communicating network based on tumor microtubes (TMs) as ultra-long membrane protrusions. The relationship between network architecture and transcriptional profile remains poorly investigated. Drugs that interfere with this syncytial connectivity such as meclofenamate (MFA) may be highly attractive for glioblastoma therapy.Methods:In a human neocortical slice model using glioblastoma cell populations of different transcriptional signatures， three-dimensional tumor networks were reconstructed， and TM-based intercellular connectivity was mapped on the basis of two-photon imaging data. MFA was used to modulate morphological and functional connectivity; downstream effects of MFA treatment were investigated by RNA sequencing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.Results:TM-based network morphology strongly differed between the transcriptional cellular subtypes of glioblastoma and was dependent on axon guidance molecule expression. MFA revealed both a functional and morphological demolishment of glioblastoma network architectures which was reflected by a reduction of TM-mediated intercellular cytosolic traffic as well as a breakdown of TM length. RNA sequencing confirmed a downregulation of NCAM and axon guidance molecule signaling upon MFA treatment. Loss of glioblastoma communicating networks was accompanied by a failure in the upregulation of genes that are required for DNA repair in response to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment and culminated in profound treatment response to TMZ-mediated toxicity.Conclusion:The capacity of TM formation reflects transcriptional cellular heterogeneity. MFA effectively demolishes functional and morphological TM-based syncytial network architectures. These findings might pave the way to a clinical implementation of MFA as a TM-targeted therapeutic approach.Keywords:glioblastoma; intercellular network architecture; meclofenamate; tumor microtubes.
Bromodomains and Extra-Terminal (BET) Inhibitor JQ1 Suppresses Proliferation of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia by Inhibiting c-Myc-Mediated Glycolysis.,Med Sci Monit, 2020 Apr 8,32266878,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32266878/,BACKGROUND Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a common blood cancer which induces high mortality in children. Bromodomains and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors， such as JQ1 and ARV-825， are promising cancer therapeutic agents that can be used by targeting c-Myc. A recent work reported that JQ1 effectively attenuates ALL in vitro by suppressing cell proliferation and accelerating apoptosis. The purpose of this research was to probe into the potential mechanism of how JQ1 inhibits ALL cell proliferation in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell viability of ALL cells were measured by CTG after treatment by JQ1. Cell cycle analysis was done by EdU and PI staining. Cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V/PI staining. Glycolysis was detected using Seahorse and LC-MS kits. The expression of glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes was assessed by RNA-seq， qRT-PCR， and Western blot. RESULTS JQ1 suppressed cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle and inducing the apoptosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia cells. JQ1 inhibited cell proliferation of B-ALL cells by restraining glycolysis. Conversely， the cell cycle block of B-ALL cells induced by JQ1 was partially abolished after pretreatment with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG)， an inhibitor of glycolysis. Furthermore， JQ1 restrained the glycolysis of B-ALL cell lines by remarkably downregulating the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis， such as hexokinase 2， phosphofructokinase， and lactate dehydrogenase A. Moreover， the cell cycle arrest was reversed in B-ALL cells with overexpressed c-Myc treated by JQ1， which is involved in the enhancement of glycolysis. CONCLUSIONS The BET inhibitor JQ1 suppresses the proliferation of ALL by inhibiting c-Myc-mediated glycolysis， thus providing a new strategy for the treatment of ALL.

EZH2 inhibition enhances the activity of Carboplatin in aggressive-variant prostate cancer cell lines.,Epigenomics, 2025 Feb,39878501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39878501/,Background:Aggressive Variant Prostate Cancers (AVPCs) are incurable malignancies. Platinum-based chemotherapies are used for the palliative treatment of AVPC. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) promotes prostate cancer progressionviahistone H3 Lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3).EZH2encodes the catalytic subunit of PRC2. A recently developed nucleosome capture technology (Nu.QⓇ).measures H3K27me3 levels in biological fluids. EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) are being tested in clinical trials. We hypothesize that epigenetic reprogrammingviaEZH2i improves the efficacy of Carboplatin in AVPC and that EZH2i activity can be measured via both cellular- and cell-free nucleosomal H3K27me3 (cf-H3K27me3) levels.Methods:We studied the expression of PRC2 genes in clinical prostate cancer cohorts (bioinformatics). We determined the effect of EZH2i on cellular- and cf-H3K27me3 levels. We measured dose-dependent effects of Carboplatin with/without EZH2i on AVPC cell viability (IC50). We used RNA-Seq to study how EZH2i modulates gene expression in AVPC cells.Results:PRC2 genes were significantly up-regulated in AVPCvsother prostate cancer types. EZH2i reduced both cellular and cf-H3K27me3 levels. EZH2i significantly reduced Carboplatin IC50. EZH2i reduced the expression of DNA repair genes and increased the expression of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic factors.Conclusions:EZH2i plus Carboplatin is a promising combination treatment for AVPC.Keywords:Carboplatin; EZH2; Tazemetostat; aggressive variant prostate cancer; epigenetics; neuroendocrine prostate cancer; personalized epigenetic therapies.

Convergence of hypoxia and TGFβ pathways on cell cycle regulation in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.,PLoS One, 2014 Mar 31,24686421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24686421/,"lthough it has been shown that HIF1 and 2 fulfill essential roles within the hematopoietic system and in the regulation of HSC fate， little is currently known about the specific mechanisms that are involved. We identified transcriptome changes induced by hypoxia， constitutively active HIF1(P402/564) and HIF2(P405/531) in human cord blood CD34+ cells. Thus， we were able to identify common hypoxia-HIF1-HIF2 gene signatures， but we also identified specific target genes that were exclusively regulated by HIF1， HIF2 or hypoxia. Geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that， besides known pathways associated with ""hypoxia-induced signaling""， also significant enrichment for the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) pathway was observed within the hypoxia/HIF1/HIF2 transcriptomes. One of the most significantly upregulated genes in both gene sets was the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1C (p57kip2). Combined hypoxia treatment or HIF overexpression together with TGFβ stimulation resulted in enhanced expression of CDKN1C and enhanced cell cycle arrest within the CD34+/CD38- stem cell compartment. Interestingly， we observed that CD34+ cells cultured under hypoxic conditions secreted high levels of latent TGFβ， suggesting an auto- or paracrine role of TGFβ in the regulation of quiescence of these cells. However， knockdown of SMAD4 could not rescue the hypoxia induced cell cycle arrest， arguing against direct effects of hypoxia-induced secreted TGFβ. Finally， the Gα-coupled receptor GTPase RGS1 was identified as a HIF-dependent hypoxia target that dampens SDF1-induced migration and signal transduction in human CD34+ stem/progenitor cells."
ATF6-Mediated Signaling Contributes to PARP Inhibitor Resistance in Ovarian Cancer.,Mol Cancer Res, 2023 Jan 3,36149636,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36149636/,High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the deadliest ovarian cancer histotype due in-part to the lack of therapeutic options for chemotherapy-resistant disease. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) represent a targeted treatment. However， PARPi resistance is becoming a significant clinical challenge. There is an urgent need to overcome resistance mechanisms to extend disease-free intervals. We established isogeneic PARPi-sensitive and -resistant HGSOC cell lines. In three PARPi-resistant models， there is a significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity and DNA repair capacity. Using RNA-sequencing and an shRNA screen， we identified activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) as a mediator of AP-1 activity， DNA damage response， and PARPi resistance. In publicly available datasets， ATF6 expression is elevated in HGSOC and portends a poorer recurrence-free survival. In a cohort of primary HGSOC tumors， higher ATF6 expression significantly correlated to PARPi resistance. In PARPi-resistant cell lines and a PDX model， inhibition of a known ATF6 regulator， p38， attenuated AP-1 activity and RAD51 foci formation， enhanced DNA damage， significantly inhibited tumor burden， and reduced accumulation of nuclear ATF6.Implications:This study highlights that a novel p38-ATF6-mediated AP-1 signaling axis contributes to PARPi resistance and provides a clinical rationale for combining PARPi and AP-1 signaling inhibitors.

Adropin Stimulates Proliferation and Inhibits Adrenocortical Steroidogenesis in the Human Adrenal Carcinoma (HAC15) Cell Line.,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne), 2020 Oct 8,33133015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33133015/,dropin is a multifunctional peptide hormone encoded by theENHO(energy homeostasis associated) gene. It plays a role in mechanisms related to increased adiposity， insulin resistance， as well as glucose， and lipid metabolism. The low adropin levels are strongly associated with obesity independent insulin resistance. On the other hand， overexpression or exogenous administration of adropin improves glucose homeostasis. The multidirectional， adropin-related effects associated with the regulation of metabolism in humans also appear to be attributable to the effects of this peptide on the activity of various elements of the endocrine system including adrenal cortex. Therefore， the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of adropin on proliferation and secretory activity in the human HAC15 adrenal carcinoma cell line. In this study， we obtained several highly interesting findings. First， GPR19， the main candidate sensitizer of adrenocortical cells to adropin， was expressed in HAC15 cells. Moreover， GPR19 expression was relatively stable and not regulated by ACTH， forskolin， or adropin itself. Our findings also suggest that adropin has the capacity to decrease expression levels of steroidogenic genes such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) andCYP11A1， which then led to a statistically significant inhibition in cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis and secretion. Based on whole transcriptome study and research involving transforming growth factor (TGF)-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor we demonstrated that attenuation of steroidogenesis caused by adropin is mediated by the TGF-β signaling pathway likely to act through transactivation mechanism. We found that HAC15 cells treated with adropin presented significantly higher proliferation levels than untreated cells. Using specific intracellular inhibitors， we showed that adropin stimulate proliferation via ERK1/2 and AKT dependent signaling pathways. We have also demonstrated that expression of GPR19 is elevated in adrenocortical carcinoma in relation to normal adrenal glands. High level of GPR19 expression in adrenocortical carcinoma may constitute a negative prognostic factor of disease progression.Keywords:GPR19; HAC15; TGF-beta; adrenal; adropin.
Effect of herbal polyphenols on atherogenic transcriptome.,Mol Cell Biochem, 2005 Oct,16180103,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16180103/,The ancient Indian system of medicine supports the antiatherogenic properties of some herbs. The crosstalk amongst the genes coding for LDLR， LXRalpha， PPARs (alpha，gamma)， CD-36 and c-myc may be important in atherogenesis because these genes control lipid metabolism， cytokine production and cellular activity within the arterial wall. Hence， we attempted for the first time to explore whether or not the polyphenols extracted from medicinal herbs had any effect on the transcription of these genes. Normal human mononuclear cells were cultured in the presence of polyphenols (and their HPLC purified sub-fractions) extracted from Green tea (Camellia sinensis)， Neem (Azadirachta indica) and Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum). Transcriptional expression of these genes was measured by using RT-PCR and SCION IMAGE analysis software. These polyphenolic extracts were found to have the inherent capacity to inhibit the transcriptional expression of genes having direct involvement in atherogenic process. On the basis of these results， we propose for the first time that HPLC purified polyphenolic fraction IV of Tulsi may have a profound antiatherogenic effect.

c-Jun/AP-1 overexpression reprograms ERα signaling related to tamoxifen response in ERα-positive breast cancer.,Oncogene, 2018 May,29467493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29467493/, critical mechanism that has been proposed for transcription regulation by estrogen receptor α (ER) is the tethering of ER to DNA via other transcription factors， such as AP-1. However， genome-wide assessment of the overlap in chromatin binding repertoires of these two transcription factors has not been reported. Here， we show that the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun interacts with ER and that c-Jun chromatin binding shows extensive overlap with ER binding at the global level. Further， we show that c-Jun overexpression reprograms ER chromatin binding and modulates ER-mediated gene regulation. Our data are consistent with a mechanism where estrogen/ER-dependent crosstalk with AP-1 at the transcriptional level is mediated through the tethering of ER to DNA bound AP-1. Additionally， in our system c-Jun overexpression causes reduced sensitivity to tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer cells. Integrated cistrome， transcriptome， and clinical data reveal TGFBI as a candidate gene which may confer tamoxifen resistance by ER and AP-1 crosstalk. Further， we show that TGFBI expression is elevated in breast cancer compared to normal breast. Together， our data provide a novel genome-wide footprint of ER and AP-1 crosstalk and suggest AP-1 and TGFBI signaling as potential therapeutic targets in AP-1-overexpressing ER-positive breast tumors.
RhoB regulates prostate cancer cell proliferation and docetaxel sensitivity via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.,BMC Cancer, 2025 Feb 26,40011853,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40011853/,Docetaxel is a widely used first-line treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). RhoB， a member of the Rho GTPase family， plays a major role in prostate cancer metastasis by modulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. It is crucial in regulating cytoskeletal reassembly， cell migration， focal adhesion (FA) dynamics. To investigate RhoB's function in prostate cancer， CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique was utilized to knock out the RhoB gene in prostate cancer cells. Successful gene editing was confirmed by using T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assays and Sanger sequencing. Knocking out RhoB enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased the IC50 value of docetaxel in RhoB-knockout PC-3 cells. This suggests increased sensitivity to docetaxel. Furthermore， RhoB knockout prompted the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells， effects that were reversed upon RhoB overexpression. Interestingly， RhoB status did not significantly influence the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells. RNA sequencing of PC-3 cells with either overexpressed or knock-out RhoB revealed that RhoB regulates pathways involved in FA， ECM receptor interaction， and PI3K-AKT signaling. These pathways directly influence the EMT process， cell migration， and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Notably， RhoB overexpression activated PI3K-AKT signaling when PC-3 cells were treated with low concentration of DTXL (50 nM， 72 h). This activation reduced DTXL's cytotoxicity， suggesting may confer chemoresistance via PI3K-AKT pathway activation.Keywords:CRISPR/Cas9; Docetaxel; Prostate cancer; RNA-Seq; RhoB.

Expression of CD44 is regulated by ELF3 in 5-FU treated colorectal cancer cells.,Gene, 2024 Jan 20,37832805,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37832805/,The development of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was usually thought to be inevitable as a result of continuing exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within CRC tissues was recently suggested to play importance roles for this process. In this study， in order to mimic a dose schedule used in clinic (continuous infusion)， low dose of fluorouracil (IC10of 5-FU) was used to treat CRC cells. Our results showed that the expression of CD44， including some other CSCs markers were all increased after 5-FU treatment. The stemness properties of survived CRC cells were also observed to be enhanced. RNA-seq analysis revealed that ELF3， one of the members of ETS (E26 transformation-specific) transcription activator family， was increased along with CD44 after 5-FU treatment of CRC cells. Results from dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that the transcription of CD44 could be activated by ELF3 in CRC cells. The induced CD44 expression in 5-FU treated CRC cells could also be decreased after the expression of ELF3 was inhibited. Moreover， it could be observed that the expression of ELF3 is significantly higher in CD44+CRC cells. Taken together， our results suggested that CD44 expression might be regulated by ELF3 and could be induced after 5-FU treatment of CRC cells. Inhibition of ELF3 might be a promising treatment method when it was used in combination with chemotherapeutics to overcome chemoresistance formation during CRC treatment in clinic.Keywords:5-fluorouracil; CD44; Chemotherapy; Colorectal cancer; ELF3.

All-trans retinoic acid induces reprogramming of canine dedifferentiated cells into neuron-like cells.,PLoS One, 2020 Mar 31,32231396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32231396/,The specification of cell identity depends on the exposure of cells to sequences of bioactive ligands. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) affects neuronal development in the early stage， and it is involved in neuronal lineage reprogramming. We previously established a fibroblast-like dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) derived from highly homogeneous mature adipocytes， which are more suitable for the study of cellular reprogramming. Canine cognitive dysfunction is similar to human cognitive dysfunction， suggesting that dogs could be a pathological and pharmacological model for human neuronal diseases. However， the effect of ATRA on neuronal reprogramming in dogs has remained unclear. Therefore， in this study， we investigated the effect of ATRA on the neuronal reprogramming of canine DFATs. ATRA induced the expression of neuronal marker mRNA/protein. The neuron-like cells showed Ca2+ influx with depolarization (50 mM KCl; 84.75 ± 4.05%) and Na+ channel activation (50 μM veratridine; 96.02 ± 2.02%). Optical imaging of presynaptic terminal activity and detection of neurotransmitter release showed that the neuron-like cells exhibited the GABAergic neuronal property. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis shows that the transcriptome profile of canine DFATs is effectively reprogrammed towards that of cortical interneuron lineage. Collectively， ATRA can produce functional GABAergic cortical interneuron-like cells from canine DFATs， exhibiting neuronal function with > 80% efficiency. We further demonstrated the contribution of JNK3 to ATRA-induced neuronal reprogramming in canine DFATs. In conclusion， the neuron-like cells from canine DFATs could be a powerful tool for translational research in cell transplantation therapy， in vitro disease modeling， and drug screening for neuronal diseases.
Deciphering the transcriptional alterations in high grade serous ovarian cancer upon catalytic inactivation of protein kinase D.,Int J Biol Macromol, 2025 Mar 6,40057070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40057070/,Objectives:To study the transcription alterations in high grade serous ovarian cancer upon catalytic inactivation of protein kinase D (PKD).Methods:PKD was catalytically inactivated in HGSOC cells OVCAR8 and SKOV3 by two highly selective， small molecule inhibitors CRT0066101， kb-NB142-70 and RNASeq analysis was performed to identify genes being differentially expressed upon this treatment. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis of the significantly differentially expressed transcripts were performed to identify the enriched biological process， molecular functions， and pathways.Results:Comparative analysis identified 264 differentially expressed genes common among two PKD-inactivated HGSOC cell lines. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed significantly enriched and functionally relevant physiological/biological processes including cell division， regulation of cell cycle and protein transport and chromatin organization. Molecular functions enriched in both cell lines after PKD inactivation were protein binding， ATP binding， protein kinase binding， transcription corepressor activity， chromatin binding， mRNA binding， ubiquitin protein ligase binding， microtubule binding and transcription factor binding. Among many， pathway analysis identified genes regulating cell proliferation， cell cycle and extracellular matrix remodelling - three paramount cellular processes that are dysregulated in HGSOC cells treated with PKD inhibitors.Conclusion:Collectively， our results show that PKD and its downstream targets positively drive several tumorigenesis-associated cellular/physiological functions and could be therapeutically targeted against a lethal pathology like HOSOC.Keywords:Epithelial ovarian cancer; Protein kinase D; RNASeq; Transcriptome.
Prognostic Value and the Immune Microenvironment-associated Role of SMAD4 in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,Anticancer Res, 2023 Dec,38030175,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38030175/,Background/aim:SMAD4 is a well-known cancer suppressor gene that regulates cell proliferation， differentiation， autoimmunity， pluripotency， and immune responses in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). We herein investigated a novel involvement of SMAD4 within the PAAD microenvironment.Materials and methods:Transcriptome data， derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression Using TIMER 2.0， CIBERSORT， and ImmuCellAI， were used to identify the immune cell infiltration pattern of PAAD. We then knocked-down SMAD4 in the PANC-1 cell line and acquired RNA-seq data through the Illumina microarray technology. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was utilized along with Gene Ontology enrichment analyses， and protein-protein interaction network analysis to screen for genes that were differentially expressed. We constructed a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network and analyzed SMAD4 copy number variation (CNV) data.Results:In PAAD， decreased levels of SMAD4 expression were found to be connected to an unfavorable prognosis. There was a significantly higher infiltration level of DC cells， CD8+ T cells， TgD， Tc， and Tex cells and a lower level of B cells and Th2 in the SMAD4-high group. The expression of SMAD4 and immune cell infiltration including CD8+ T cells， myeloid dendritic cells， neutrophils， and macrophages are significantly positively correlated. DEGs were found enriched in the hypoxia response pathway. The six hypoxia-related genes exhibited a significant correlation with immune cell infiltration and survival rates. SMAD4 CNV levels were associated with MSI， stemness， infiltration of immune cells， and survival rates.Conclusion:A statistically significant correlation was found between SMAD4 expression and immune cell infiltration. SMAD4 could mediate hypoxia response in pancreatic cancer. The CNV levels of SMAD4 were associated with prognosis. SMAD4 has potential as a prognostic biomarker and provides a new orientation for the immunotherapy of PAAD.Keywords:SMAD4; hypoxia; microenvironment; pancreatic cancer.
Live-cell imaging of human liver fibrosis using hepatic micro-organoids.,JCI Insight, 2024 Dec 10,39656528,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39656528/,Due to the limitations of available in vitro systems and animal models， we lack a detailed understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of and have minimal treatment options for liver fibrosis. Therefore， we engineered a live-cell imaging system that assessed fibrosis in a human multilineage hepatic organoid in a microwell (i.e.， microHOs). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TGFB converted mesenchymal cells in microHOs into myofibroblast-like cells resembling those in fibrotic human liver tissue. When pro-fibrotic intracellular signaling pathways were examined， the antifibrotic effect of receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors was limited to the fibrosis induced by the corresponding growth factor， which indicates their antifibrotic efficacy would be limited to fibrotic diseases solely mediated by that growth factor. Based upon transcriptomic and transcription factor activation analyses in microHOs， glycogen synthase kinase 3β and p38 MAPK inhibitors were identified as potential new broad-spectrum therapies for liver fibrosis. Other new therapies could subsequently be identified using the microHO system.Keywords:Fibrosis; Hepatology.
Antibacterial and anticancer activity of two NK-lysin-derived peptides from the Antarctic teleost Trematomus bernacchii.,Fish Shellfish Immunol, 2023 Nov,37734650,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37734650/,The NK-lysin antimicrobial peptide， first identified in mammals， possesses both antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. Homologue peptides isolated from different fish species have been examined for their functional characteristics in the last few years. In this study， a NK-lysin transcript was identified in silico from the head kidney transcriptome of the Antarctic teleost Trematomus bernacchii. The corresponding amino acid sequence， slightly longer than NK-lysins of other fish species， contains six cysteine residues that in mammalian counterparts form three disulphide bridges. Real time-PCR analysis indicated its predominant expression in T. bernacchii immune-related organs and tissues， with greatest mRNA abundance detected in gills and spleen. Instead of focusing on the full T. bernacchii derived NK-lysin mature molecule， we selected a 27 amino acid residue peptide (named NKL-WT)， corresponding to the potent antibiotic NK-2 sequence found in human NK-lysin. Moreover， we designed a mutant peptide (named NKL-MUT) in which two alanine residues substitute the two cysteines found in the NKL-WT. The two peptides were obtained by solid phase organic synthesis to investigate their functional features. NKL-WT and NKL-MUT displayed antibacterial activity against the human pathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecalis and the ESKAPE pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii， respectively. Moreover， at the determined Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration values against these pathogens， both peptides showed high selectivity as they did not exhibit any haemolytic activity on erythrocytes or cytotoxic activity against mammalian primary cell lines. Finally， the NKL-MUT selectively triggers the killing of the melanoma cell line B16F10 by means of a pro-apoptotic pathway at a concentration range in which no effects were found in normal mammalian cell lines. In conclusion， the two peptides could be considered as promising candidates in the fight against antibiotic resistance and tumour proliferative action， and also be used as innovative adjuvants， either to decrease chemotherapy side effects or to enhance anticancer drug activity.Keywords:Acinetobacter baumannii; Antimicrobial peptides; Enterococcus faecalis; Melanoma cells; NK-lysin; Trematomus bernacchii.
A network-based phenotype mapping approach to identify genes that modulate drug response phenotypes.,Sci Rep, 2016 Nov 14,27841317,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27841317/,To better address the problem of drug resistance during cancer chemotherapy and explore the possibility of manipulating drug response phenotypes， we developed a network-based phenotype mapping approach (P-Map) to identify gene candidates that upon perturbed can alter sensitivity to drugs. We used basal transcriptomics data from a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) to infer drug response networks (DRNs) that are responsible for conferring response phenotypes for anthracycline and taxane， two common anticancer agents use in clinics. We further tested selected gene candidates that interact with phenotypic differentially expressed genes (PDEGs)， which are up-regulated genes in LCL for a given class of drug response phenotype in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Our results indicate that it is possible to manipulate a drug response phenotype， from resistant to sensitive or vice versa， by perturbing gene candidates in DRNs and suggest plausible mechanisms regulating directionality of drug response sensitivity. More important， the current work highlights a new way to formulate systems-based therapeutic design: supplementing therapeutics that aim to target disease culprits with phenotypic modulators capable of altering DRN properties with the goal to re-sensitize resistant phenotypes.
3-[[(3S)-1，2，3，4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-Carbonyl]Amino]Propanoic Acid (THICAPA) Is Protective Against Abeta42-Induced Toxicity In Vitro and in an Alzheimer's Disease Drosophila.,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci, 2023 Oct 28,37453137,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37453137/,lzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia globally. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) extracellular senile plaques in the brain is one of the hallmark mechanisms found in AD. Aβ42 is the most damaging and aggressively aggregating Aβ isomer produced in the brain. Although Aβ42 has been extensively researched as a crucial peptide connected to the development of the characteristic amyloid fibrils in AD， the specifics of its pathophysiology are still unknown. Therefore， the main objective was to identify novel compounds that could potentially mitigate the negative effects of Aβ42. 3-[[(3S)-1，2，3，4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carbonyl]amino]propanoic acid (THICAPA) was identified as a ligand for Aβ42 and for reducing fibrillary Aβ42 aggregation. THICAPA also improved cell viability when administered to PC12 neuronal cells that were exposed to Aβ42. Additionally， this compound diminished Aβ42 toxicity in the current AD Drosophila model by rescuing the rough eye phenotype， prolonging the life span， and enhancing motor functions. Through next-generation RNA-sequencing， immune response pathways were downregulated in response to THICAPA treatment. Thus， this study suggests THICAPA as a possible disease-modifying treatment for AD.Keywords:Drosophila melanogaster; Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ42; RNA-sequencing; THICAPA.
Raf/ERK drives the proliferative and invasive phenotype of BMPR2-silenced pulmonary artery endothelial cells.,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, 2016 Jan 15,26589479,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26589479/, proliferative endothelial cell phenotype， inflammation， and pulmonary vascular remodeling are prominent features of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2) loss-of-function is the most common cause of heritable PAH and has been closely linked to the formation of pathological plexiform lesions. Although some BMPR2 mutations leave ligand-dependent responses intact， the disruption of ligand-independent， noncanonical functions are universal among PAH-associated BMPR2 genotypes， but incompletely understood. This study examined the noncanonical signaling consequences of BMPR2 silencing in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells to identify potential therapeutic targets. BMPR2 siRNA silencing resulted in a proliferative， promigratory pulmonary artery endothelial cell phenotype and disruption of cytoskeletal architecture. Expression profiling closely reflected these phenotypic changes. Gene set enrichment and promoter analyses， as well as the differential expression of pathway components identified Ras/Raf/ERK signaling as an important consequence of BMPR2 silencing. Raf family members and ERK1/2 were constitutively activated after BMPR2 knockdown. Two Raf inhibitors， sorafenib and AZ628， and low-dose nintedanib， a triple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor upstream from Ras， reversed the abnormal proliferation and hypermotility of BMPR2 deficiency. Inhibition of dysregulated Ras/Raf/ERK signaling may be useful in reversing vascular remodeling in PAH.Keywords:BMPR2; endothelial cell dysfunction; nintedanib; pulmonary arterial hypertension.
FOX transcription factor family in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer, 2020 Aug,32437734,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32437734/,The pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multistep process， involving the progressive accumulation of molecular alterations and transcriptomic alterations. The Forkhead-box (FOX) transcription factor family is characterized by its unique DNA binding domain (FKH or winged-helix domain). Human FOX family consists of about 17 subfamilies， at least 43 members. Some of them are liver-enriched transcription factors， suggesting that they may play a crucial role in the development or/and functions of the liver. Dysregulation of FOX transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC because they can activate or suppress the expression of various tumor-related molecules， and pinpoint different molecular and cellular events. Here we summarized， analyzed and discussed the status and the functions of the human FOX family of transcription factors in HCC， aiming to help the further development of them as potential therapeutic targets or/and diagnostic/prognostic markers for HCC.Keywords:Forkhead-box; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver-enriched; Transcription factors.
Curcuma Longa Induces the Transcription Factor FOXP3 to Downregulate Human Chemokine CCR5 Expression and Inhibit HIV-1 Infection.,Am J Chin Med, 2023,37314412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37314412/,HIV mutations occur frequently despite the substantial success of combination antiretroviral therapy， which significantly impairs HIV progression. Failure to develop specific vaccines， the occurrence of drug-resistant strains， and the high incidence of adverse effects due to combination antiviral therapy regimens call for novel and safer antivirals. Natural products are an important source of new anti-infective agents. For instance， curcumin inhibits HIV and inflammation in cell culture assays. Curcumin， the principal constituent of the dried rhizomes ofCurcuma longaL. (turmeric)， is known as a strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with different pharmacological effects. This work aims to assess curcumin's inhibitory effects on HIVin vitroand to explore the underpinning mechanism， focusing on CCR5 and the transcription factor forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3). First， curcumin and the RT inhibitor zidovudine (AZT) were evaluated for their inhibitory properties. HIV-1 pseudovirus infectivity was determined by green fluorescence and luciferase activity measurements in HEK293T cells. AZT was used as a positive control that inhibited HIV-1 pseudoviruses dose-dependently， with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Then， a molecular docking analysis was carried out to assess the binding affinities of curcumin for CCR5 and HIV-1 RNase H/RT. The anti-HIV activity assay showed that curcumin inhibited HIV-1 infection， and the molecular docking analysis revealed equilibrium dissociation constants of [Formula: see text]9.8[Formula: see text]kcal/mol and [Formula: see text]9.3[Formula: see text]kcal/mol between curcumin and CCR5 and HIV-1 RNase H/RT， respectively. To examine curcumin's anti-HIV effect and its mechanismin vitro， cell cytotoxicity， transcriptome sequencing， and CCR5 and FOXP3 amounts were assessed at different concentrations of curcumin. In addition， human CCR5 promoter deletion constructs and the FOXP3 expression plasmid pRP-FOXP3 (with an EGFP tag) were generated. Whether FOXP3 DNA binding to the CCR5 promoter was blunted by curcumin was examined using transfection assays employing truncated CCR5 gene promoter constructs， a luciferase reporter assay， and a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore， micromolar concentrations of curcumin inactivated the nuclear transcription factor FOXP3， which resulted in decreased expression of CCR5 in Jurkat cells. Moreover， curcumin inhibited PI3K-AKT activation and its downstream target FOXP3. These findings provide mechanistic evidence encouraging further assessment of curcumin as a dietary agent used to reduce the virulence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Curcumin-mediated FOXP3 degradation was also reflected in its functions， namely， CCR5 promoter transactivation and HIV-1 virion production. Furthermore， curcumin inhibition of CCR5 and HIV-1 might constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for reducing HIV progression.Keywords:CCR5; Curcuma longa L.; FOXP3; HIV-1; Inhibition; Regulation.
Identification of SLC3A2 as a Potential Therapeutic Target of Osteoarthritis Involved in Ferroptosis by Integrating Bioinformatics， Clinical Factors and Experiments.,Cells, 2022 Oct 30,36359826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36359826/,Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of arthritis that causes joint pain and limited mobility. In recent years， some studies have shown that the pathological process of OA chondrocytes is related to ferroptosis. Our study aims to identify and validate differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) in OA chondrocytes and to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms. RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by four methods: limma-voom， edgeR， DESeq2， and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA)， protein-protein interactions (PPI)， and cytoHubba of Cytoscape were applied to identify hub genes. Clinical OA cartilage specimens were collected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis， western blotting (WB)， histological staining， transmission electron microscopy (TEM)， and transfection. Sankey diagram was used to visualize the relationships between the expression level of SLC3A2 in the damaged area and clinical factors. Based on bioinformatics analysis， clinical factors， and experiment validation， SLC3A2 was identified as a hub gene. It was down-regulated in OA cartilage compared to normal cartilage (p <0.05). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that SLC3A2 was associated with ferroptosis-related functions. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SLC3A2 in the OA cartilage-damaged area was closely related to BMI， obesity grade， and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Furthermore， in vitro experiments validated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. In summary， we demonstrated that SLC3A2 inhibited ferroptosis and suppressed cartilage degeneration in OA. These findings provide a new idea for the study of the pathogenesis of OA， thus providing new means for the clinical diagnosis and targeted therapy of OA.Keywords:GEO; cartilage; ferroptosis; osteoarthritis.
Dihydromyricetin Inhibited Migration and Invasion by Reducing S100A4 Expression through ERK1/2/beta-Catenin Pathway in Human Cervical Cancer Cell Lines.,Int J Mol Sci, 2022 Dec 1,36499426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36499426/,Cervical cancer has a poor prognosis and is the fourth most common cancer among women. Dihydromyricetin (DHM)， a flavonoid compound， exhibits several pharmacological activities， including anticancer effects; however， the effects of DHM on cervical cancer have received insufficient research attention. This study examined the antitumor activity and underlying mechanisms of DHM on human cervical cancer. Our results indicated that DHM inhibits migration and invasion in HeLa and SiHa cell lines. Mechanistically， RNA sequencing analysis revealed that DHM suppressed S100A4 mRNA expression in HeLa cells. Moreover， DHM inhibited the protein expressions of β-catenin and GSK3β through the regulated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway. By using the ERK1/2 activator， T-BHQ， reverted β-catenin and S100A4 protein expression and cell migration， which were reduced in response to DHM. In conclusion， our study indicated that DHM inhibited cell migration by reducing the S100A4 expression through the ERK1/2/β-catenin pathway in human cervical cancer cell lines.Keywords:DHM; S100A4; cervical cancer; metastasis; β-catenin.
Targeted inhibition of MASTL kinase activity induces apoptosis in breast cancer.,Life Sci, 2023 Dec 1,37931742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37931742/,Microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like (MASTL) (or Greatwall kinase (GWL)) is an important cell cycle regulating kinase that regulates the G2-M transition. Uncontrolled MASTL activity is implicated in breast cancer progression. To date， very few inhibitors have been reported against this protein. Here， structure-based computational modeling indicates that the natural product flavopiridol (FLV) binds strongly to MASTL and these results are validated using molecular dynamics simulation studies. An in vitro kinase assay reveals an EC50(effective concentration) value of FLV to be 82.1 nM and a better IC50compared to the positive reference compound， staurosporine. FLV is found to inhibit MASTL kinase activity， arresting the cell growth in the G1 phase and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Consistent with these results differential gene expression obtained using RNA sequencing studies， and validated by RT PCR and immunoblot analysis， indicate that MASTL inhibition induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic-related genes. Furthermore， metastasis- and inflammation-related genes are downregulated. Thus， the deregulation of MASTL signaling pathways on targeted inhibition of its kinase activity is revealed. This study lays a strong foundation for investigating FLV as a lead compound in breast cancer therapeutics.Keywords:Breast cancer; Flavopiridol; In silico; In vitro; Kinase assay; MASTL.
Anoikis-related PLCB4 is linked to immunotherapy response in osteosarcoma.,Discov Oncol, 2025 Feb 22,39987366,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39987366/,Osteosarcoma， the most common primary bone malignancy， poses significant management challenges due to its aggressiveness and metastatic potential. This study investigates the role of anoikis-related genes， particularly phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4)， as a prognostic biomarker in osteosarcoma. We analyzed transcriptome data from the TARGET and GSE21257 cohorts using bioinformatics tools， identifying 15 significant genes， with PLCB4 as a key marker linked to decreased survival. Our findings indicate a negative correlation between PLCB4 and immune microenvironment scores and checkpoint molecules， suggesting its impact on immunotherapy responses. Drug sensitivity analyses revealed that high PLCB4 expression correlates with lower IC50 values for several chemotherapeutic agents. In vitro experiments showed that silencing PLCB4 inhibited cell proliferation and reduced PD-L1 expression. This study underscores the critical role of PLCB4 in osteosarcoma progression and its potential as a therapeutic target， offering insights into the molecular mechanisms of osteosarcoma biology and improving prognostic accuracy and treatment strategies.
SIRT2 Contributes to the Resistance of Melanoma Cells to the Multikinase Inhibitor Dasatinib.,Cancers (Basel), 2019 May 14,31091806,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31091806/,Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer and can only be cured if detected early. Unfortunately， later stages of the disease do not guarantee success due to the rapid rate of melanoma cell metastasis and their high resistance to applied therapies. The search for new molecular targets and targeted therapy may represent the future in the development of effective methods for combating this cancer. SIRT2 is a promising target; thus， we downregulatedSIRT2expression in melanoma cells in vertical growth and metastatic phases and demonstrated that sirtuin acts as regulator of the basic functions of melanoma cells. A detailed transcriptomic analysis showed that SIRT2 regulates the expression of multiple genes encoding the tyrosine kinase pathways that are molecular targets of dasatinib. Indeed， cells with lowSIRT2expression were more susceptible to dasatinib， as demonstrated by multiple techniques， e.g.， neutral red uptake， 3/7 caspase activity， colony formation assay， and in vitro scratch assay. Furthermore， these cells showed an altered phosphorylation profile for proteins playing roles in the response to dasatinib. Thus， our research indicates new， previously unknown SIRT2 functions in the regulation of gene expression， which is of key clinical significance.Keywords:melanoma， SIRT2， sirtuins， tyrosine kinase， resistance.
CBX2 shapes chromatin accessibility promoting AML via p38 MAPK signaling pathway.,Mol Cancer, 2022 Jun 9,35681235,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35681235/,Background:The dynamic epigenome and proteins specialized in the interpretation of epigenetic marks critically contribute to leukemic pathogenesis but also offer alternative therapeutic avenues. Targeting newly discovered chromatin readers involved in leukemogenesis may thus provide new anticancer strategies. Accumulating evidence suggests that the PRC1 complex member CBX2 is overexpressed in solid tumors and promotes cancer cell survival. However， its role in leukemia is still unclear.Methods:We exploited reverse genetic approaches to investigate the role of CBX2 in human leukemic cell lines and ex vivo samples. We also analyzed phenotypic effects following CBX2 silencing using cellular and molecular assays and related functional mechanisms by ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. We then performed bioinformatic analysis of ChIP-seq data to explore the influence of histone modifications in CBX2-mediated open chromatin sites. Lastly， we used molecular assays to determine the contribution of CBX2-regulated pathways to leukemic phenotype.Results:We found CBX2 overexpressed in leukemia both in vitro and ex vivo samples compared to CD34+cells. Decreased CBX2 RNA levels prompted a robust reduction in cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Similarly， sensitivity to CBX2 silencing was observed in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples. CBX2 suppression increased genome-wide chromatin accessibility followed by alteration of leukemic cell transcriptional programs， resulting in enrichment of cell death pathways and downregulation of survival genes. Intriguingly， CBX2 silencing induced epigenetic reprogramming at p38 MAPK-associated regulatory sites with consequent deregulation of gene expression.Conclusions:Our results identify CBX2 as a crucial player in leukemia progression and highlight a potential druggable CBX2-p38 MAPK network in AML.Keywords:CBX2; Cancer; Chromatin readers; Epigenetics; Leukemia; PcG.
Imperatorin inhibits LPS-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages activation by decreased NF-κB p65 phosphorylation.,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol, 2023 Oct,36995149,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36995149/,Background:Imperatorin (IMP) is a secondary metabolite of plants and is the most abundant in Angelica dahurica. Previous studies showed that IMP exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in RAW264.7 cell line. Here， we aim to investigate the roles and mechanisms of IMP in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)， in view of the difference between primary macrophages and cell lines.Methods:BMDMs were stimulated with LPS for the inflammation model. Flow cytometry was performed with BMDMs treated with different doses of IMP (0-20mg/L) within staining Annexin V-APC for 5 min. The cytokines and inflammatory mediators were detected by RT-PCR or ELISA. RNA-seq was performed in IMP-treated BMDMs or control， stimulated with LPS for 6h. Western blotting is carried out to determine the phosphorylation of p65， ERK1/2， JNK1， p38， and Akt.Results:Our results showed that IMP inhibited IL-12p40， IL-6， TNF-α and IL-1β in LPS-stimulated BMDMs. RNA-seq analysis suggested that IMP inhibits Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (KEGG)， TNF signaling pathway (KEGG)， NF-κB signaling pathway (KEGG)， Inflammatory Response (GO). In addition， IMP inhibitedmyd88，tpl2，cxcl1，ptgs2(COX-2) expression in mRNA level. Finally， we found decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in IMP-treated BMDMs， after stimulated with LPS.Conclusion:IMP inhibits IL-12p40， IL-6， TNF-α， and IL-1β expression in LPS-stimulated BMDMs. IMP inhibits macrophage activation， which maybe resulted in decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore， IMP may protect against the progress of inflammatory-related diseases.Keywords:Imperatorin; LPS; NF-κB; activation; bone marrow-derived macrophages.
Ursodeoxycholic Acid Inhibits Glioblastoma Progression via Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Related Apoptosis and Synergizes with the Proteasome Inhibitor Bortezomib.,ACS Chem Neurosci, 2020 May 6,32239921,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32239921/,Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has demonstrated cancer suppressive potential in several tumors. Here， we investigated the antitumor potential and biochemical mechanism of UDCA on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)， the deadliest form of brain cancer with a median survival of 15 months. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 and colony forming assays. Expression profiles were obtained using RNA sequencing， and PCR and Western blot were used to validate changes in related markers at the RNA and protein levels. Flow cytometry was used to examine cell cycle， apoptosis， mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)， and reactive oxygen species (ROS). UDCA inhibited GBM cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry demonstrated that cells were arrested in the G1 phase and underwent apoptosis. The RNA sequencing results showed UDCA treatment in part targeted gene expression related to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). UDCA indeed led to decreased MMP， overproduction of ROS， and ER stress. Three critical ER stress sensors ATF6， IRE1α， and PERK were increased in the acute phase. Additionally， combining UDCA with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) achieved a synergistic effect through enhancing the PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathway and protracting ER stress. UDCA inhibited GBM progression， and the combination with BTZ achieved a synergistic effect via protracted ER stress. Thus， UDCA， alone or with combination of BTZ， shows promise as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of GBM.Keywords:ER stress; Ursodeoxycholic acid; bortezomib; glioblastoma; synergism.
Betulinic Acid Exerts Cytotoxic Activity Against Multidrug-Resistant Tumor Cells via Targeting Autocrine Motility Factor Receptor (AMFR).,Front Pharmacol, 2018 May 15,29867487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29867487/,Betulinic acid (BetA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the outer bark of white-barked birch trees and many other medicinal plants. Here， we studied betulinic acid's cytotoxic activity against drug-resistant tumor cell lines. P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) and BCRP (ABCG2) are known ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters that mediating MDR. ABCB5 is a close relative to ABCB1， which also mediates MDR. Constitutive activation of the EGF receptor is tightly linked to the development of chemotherapeutic resistance. BetA inhibited P-gp， BCRP， ABCB5 and mutation activated EGFR overexpressing cells with similar efficacy as their drug-sensitive parental counterparts. Furthermore， the mRNA expressions of ABCB1， BCRP， ABCB5 and EGFR were not related to the 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) for BetA in a panel of 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)， USA. In addition to well-established MDR mechanisms， we attempted to identify other molecular mechanisms that play a role in mediating BetA's cytotoxic activity. For this reason， we performed COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses of the transcriptome-wide microarray-based mRNA expression of the NCI cell lines panel. Various genes significantly correlating to BetA's activity were involved in different biological processes， e.g.， cell cycle regulation， microtubule formation， signal transduction， transcriptional regulation， chromatin remodeling， cell adhesion， tumor suppression， ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Immunoblotting andin silicoanalyses revealed that the inhibition of AMFR activity might be one of the mechanisms for BetA to overcome MDR phenotypes. In conclusion， BetA may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of refractory tumors.Keywords:autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR); bioinformatics; cancer; drug resistance; microarray; pharmacogenomics; phytotherapy; triterpene.
Disease modifying osteoarthritis drug discovery using a temporal phenotypic reporter in 3D aggregates of primary human chondrocytes.,J Orthop Res, 2025 Mar,39628068,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39628068/,Our aim was to develop a novel approach to identify disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis (OA)， focusing on stimulating type II collagen anabolism in chondrocytes. As ELISA or western blot are destructive， laborious and time consuming， primary human chondrocytes expressing Gaussia luciferase under the control of the type II collagen promoter were developed and used. We cultured them in 3D cartilage aggregates under physioxia， to temporally screen a natural product library over 3-weeks. Hit compounds were analyzed for their potential targets in silico， first by structure， then by RNA-Seq. Two hit compounds were then further analyzed using biochemical assays， dose-response curves， and histological analyses to confirm their effects on type II collagen expression and chondrogenesis. Aromoline shows promise as a potential disease modifying compound， demonstrating an increase in type II collagen expression within cartilage sourced from chondrocytes of three distinct donors. Aromoline is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid that has been studied for its antiproliferative， anti-inflammatory， and antimicrobial properties， and we are the first to explore its effects on chondrocytes and chondrogenesis. In silico analysis revealed the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) as a potential target， confirmed by type II collagen upregulation after aromoline treatment and with DRD4-specific agonist ABT-724. This novel approach combining in silico and in vitro methods provides a platform for drug discovery in a challenging and under-researched area. In conclusion， a novel drug (aromoline) and target receptor (DRD4) were identified as stimulating type II collagen， with the future goal of treating or preventing OA.Keywords:3D cartilage culture; disease modifying drug; dopamine receptor D4; phenotypic drug screening; primary human chondrocytes.
Structure-function relationships of the disease-linked A218T oxytocin receptor variant.,Mol Psychiatry, 2022 Feb,34980886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980886/,Various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene have been associated with behavioral traits， autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other diseases. The non-synonymous SNP rs4686302 results in the OXTR variant A218T and has been linked to core characteristics of ASD， trait empathy and preterm birth. However， the molecular and intracellular mechanisms underlying those associations are still elusive. Here， we uncovered the molecular and intracellular consequences of this mutation that may affect the psychological or behavioral outcome of oxytocin (OXT)-treatment regimens in clinical studies， and provide a mechanistic explanation for an altered receptor function. We created two monoclonal HEK293 cell lines， stably expressing either the wild-type or A218T OXTR. We detected an increased OXTR protein stability， accompanied by a shift in Ca2+dynamics and reduced MAPK pathway activation in the A218T cells. Combined whole-genome and RNA sequencing analyses in OXT-treated cells revealed 7823 differentially regulated genes in A218T compared to wild-type cells， including 429 genes being associated with ASD. Furthermore， computational modeling provided a molecular basis for the observed change in OXTR stability suggesting that the OXTR mutation affects downstream events by altering receptor activation and signaling， in agreement with our in vitro results. In summary， our study provides the cellular mechanism that links the OXTR rs4686302 SNP with genetic dysregulations associated with aspects of ASD.
Resistance to BET Inhibitor Leads to Alternative Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,Cell Rep, 2018 Feb 27,29490263,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29490263/,BRD4 plays a major role in the transcription networks orchestrated by androgen receptor (AR) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Several BET inhibitors (BETi) that displace BRD4 from chromatin are being evaluated in clinical trials for CRPC. Here， we describe mechanisms of acquired resistance to BETi that are amenable to targeted therapies in CRPC. BETi-resistant CRPC cells displayed cross-resistance to a variety of BETi in the absence of gatekeeper mutations， exhibited reduced chromatin-bound BRD4， and were less sensitive to BRD4 degraders/knockdown， suggesting a BRD4-independent transcription program. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reactivation of AR signaling due to CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of AR， resulting in sensitivity to CDK9 inhibitors and enzalutamide. Additionally， increased DNA damage associated with PRC2-mediated transcriptional silencing of DDR genes was observed， leading to PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Collectively， our results identify the therapeutic limitation of BETi as a monotherapy; however， our BETi resistance data suggest unique opportunities for combination therapies in treating CRPC.Keywords:AR; BET inhibitors; BRCAness; CDK9; DNA damage; PARP inhibitors; acquired drug resistance; chromatin; prostate cancer.

Amplification of distant estrogen response elements deregulates target genes associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.,Cancer Cell, 2013 Aug 12,23948299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948299/, causal role of gene amplification in tumorigenesis is well known， whereas amplification of DNA regulatory elements as an oncogenic driver remains unclear. In this study， we integrated next-generation sequencing approaches to map distant estrogen response elements (DEREs) that remotely control the transcription of target genes through chromatin proximity. Two densely mapped DERE regions located on chromosomes 17q23 and 20q13 were frequently amplified in estrogen receptor-α-positive luminal breast cancer. These aberrantly amplified DEREs deregulated target gene expression potentially linked to cancer development and tamoxifen resistance. Progressive accumulation of DERE copies was observed in normal breast progenitor cells chronically exposed to estrogenic chemicals. These findings may extend to other DNA regulatory elements， the amplification of which can profoundly alter target transcriptome during tumorigenesis.
LncRNA SNHG15: A potential therapeutic target in the treatment of colorectal cancer.,Chem Biol Drug Des, 2023 May,35191201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35191201/,The global burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing annually. CRC could develop from genetic and phenotypic factors involving changes in gene expression. Incredibly， the human genome transcribes into non-coding RNAs， among which long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) signify the most crucial part of the transcriptome in multicellular organisms. lncRNAs affect gene expression at multiple levels， from transcription to protein localization and stability. Recent studies have implicated lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in cancers occurrence and progression. Previously， an indication suggests SNHG15 overexpression triggers proliferation， metastasis， and impedes apoptosis in CRC. Further， through its activity of binding micro-RNAs， lncRNA SNHG15 modulates genes associated with CRC progression and promotes CRC resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Here， we reviewed recent findings on the various mechanisms and roles of lncRNA SNHG15 implicated in CRC tumorigenesis. We further highlight how SNHG15 plays a vital role in regulating critical pathways linked to the development and progression of CRC. Finally， we highlight how SNHG15 can be modulated for CRC treatments and the various therapeutic strategies to be implored when targeting SNHG15 in the context of CRC treatments. Findings from these studies present SNHG15 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing and treating CRC.Keywords:MT; SNHG15; Wnt/β-catenin; colorectal cancer; lncRNA; micro-RNAs.

The Role of PDGFRA in Predicting Oncological and Immune Characteristics in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,J Oncol, 2022 Mar 26,35378770,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35378770/,"Objective:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal solid gastrointestinal malignancy with poor immune infiltration and a limited response to immunotherapy. The aim of our study was to explore the predictive value of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs)， which are widely expressed in various tumor cells.Methods:Transcriptomic data with follow-up information were obtained from the GEO， TCGA and ArrayExpress. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and univariate Cox (UniCox) proportional hazard regression were used to show the survival outcomes of the groups. Immune infiltration was analyzed using the online databases TISCH， TISIDB， TIMER2.0， and TIDE as well as the R packages ""estimate"" and ""GSVA."" Mutation and functional enrichment analyses were conducted using the R packages ""maftools，"" ""clusterProfiler，"" and online repository HOME for Researchers. Finally， the results were validated in 79 samples from our cancer center.Results:Survival analysis using public databases and the FUSCC cohort indicated PDGFRA to be associated with prolonged overall survival (OS) (bothp< 0.05). PDGFRA expression was highest in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of PDAC， as validated in public databases and cell lines from our cancer center. The high expression of PDGFRA was associated with increased immune infiltration and potent T cell cytotoxicity in PDAC.Conclusion:In summary， high PDGFRA expression is associated with increased immune infiltration and prolonged OS. This finding might provide a new strategy for regulating immune cell infiltration in PDAC and improving the efficacy of immunotherapy."
Seleno-aspirin compound AS-10 promotes histone acetylation ahead of suppressing androgen receptor transcription， G1 arrest， and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.,Prostate, 2023 Jan,35996318,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35996318/,Background:The novel selenium-aspirin compound AS-10 was recently reported by us with a cancer cell killing potency three orders of magnitude greater than aspirin in pancreatic cancer cell lines with caspase-mediated apoptosis and a reasonable selectivity against malignant cells. Although we also observed its cytocidal activity against PC-3 and DU145 androgen receptor (AR)-negative and P53-null/mutant aggressive human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines in NCI-60 screen， the potential involvement and targeting of AR and P53 pathways that are intact in early-stage prostate carcinogenesis has not been examined， nor its primary molecular signaling after exposure.Methods:Human LNCaP PCa cells with functional AR and intact P53 were used to examine their cell cycle and cell fate responses to AS-10 exposure and upstream molecular signaling events including histone acetylation as a known aspirin effect. The AR-positive 22Rv1 human PCa cells were used to validate key findings.Results:In addition to confirming AS-10's superior cytocidal potency than aspirin against all four PCa cell lines， we report a rapid (within 5 min) promotion of histone acetylation several hours ahead of the suppression of AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA， coded by KLK3 gene) in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. AS-10 decreased AR and KLK3 mRNA levels without impacting pre-existing AR protein degradation or nuclear translocation in LNCaP cells. Sustained exposure to AS-10 arrested cells predominantly in G1， and induced caspase-mediated apoptosis without necrosis. The death induced by AS-10 in LNCaP cells was attenuated by nontranscriptional activation of P53 protein or Jun N-terminal Kinase cellular stress signaling and was mitigated modestly by glutathione-boosting antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. AS-10 synergized with histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA to suppress AR/PSA abundance and kill LNCaP cells. RNA-seq confirmed AR suppression at the transcriptional level and suggested multiple oncogene， cyclin， and CDK/CKI transcriptional actions to contribute to the cellular consequences.Conclusions:AS-10 promotes histone acetylation as its probable primary mechanism of action to induce PCa cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis， regardless of AR and P53 status. Nevertheless， the inhibition of AR signaling through mechanisms distinct from canonical AR antagonists may hold promise for combinatorial use with androgen deprivation therapy regimens or AR-axis targeting drugs.Keywords:apoptosis; histone acetylation; histone deacetylase inhibitor; prostate cancer; selenium-aspirin.
Gossypol Induces Apoptosis of Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells via CHOP/Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Signaling Pathway.,J Microbiol Biotechnol, 2022 May 28,35283426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35283426/,Gossypol， a natural phenolic aldehyde present in cotton plants， was originally used as a means of contraception， but is currently being studied for its anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects on various cancers. However， the intracellular mechanism of action regarding the effects of gossypol on pancreatic cancer cells remains unclear. Here， we investigated the anti-cancer effects of gossypol on human pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2). Cell counting kit-8 assays， annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays， and transmission electron microscopy showed that gossypol induced apoptotic cell death and apoptotic body formation in both cell lines. RNA sequencing analysis also showed that gossypol increased the mRNA levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in pancreatic cancer cell lines. In addition， gossypol facilitated the cleavage of caspase-3 via protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)， CHOP， and Bax/Bcl-2 upregulation in both cells， whereas the upregulation of ATF was limited to BxPC-3 cells. Finally， a three-dimensional culture experiment confirmed the successful suppression of cancer cell spheroids via gossypol treatment. Taken together， our data suggest that gossypol may trigger apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells via the PERK-CHOP signaling pathway. These findings propose a promising therapeutic approach to pancreatic cancer treatment using gossypol.Keywords:CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein; Gossypol; apoptosis; endoplasmic reticulum stress; pancreatic cancer.

ATM-NFκB axis-driven TIGAR regulates sensitivity of glioma cells to radiomimetics in the presence of TNFα.,Cell Death Dis, 2013 May 2,23640457,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23640457/,Gliomas are resistant to radiation therapy， as well as to TNFα induced killing. Radiation-induced TNFα triggers Nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-mediated radioresistance. As inhibition of NFκB activation sensitizes glioma cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis， we investigated whether TNFα modulates the responsiveness of glioma cells to ionizing radiation-mimetic Neocarzinostatin (NCS). TNFα enhanced the ability of NCS to induce glioma cell apoptosis. NCS-mediated death involved caspase-9 activation， reduction of mitochondrial copy number and lactate production. Death was concurrent with NFκB， Akt and Erk activation. Abrogation of Akt and NFκB activation further potentiated the death inducing ability of NCS in TNFα cotreated cells. NCS-induced p53 expression was accompanied by increase in TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) levels and ATM phosphorylation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TIGAR abrogated NCS-induced apoptosis. While DN-IκB abrogated NCS-induced TIGAR both in the presence and absence of TNFα， TIGAR had no effect on NFκB activation. Transfection with TIGAR mutant (i) decreased apoptosis and γH2AX foci formation (ii) decreased p53 (iii) elevated ROS and (iv) increased Akt/Erk activation in cells cotreated with NCS and TNFα. Heightened TIGAR expression was observed in GBM tumors. While NCS induced ATM phosphorylation in a NFκB independent manner， ATM inhibition abrogated TIGAR and NFκB activation. Metabolic gene profiling indicated that TNFα affects NCS-mediated regulation of several genes associated with glycolysis. The existence of ATM-NFκB axis that regulate metabolic modeler TIGAR to overcome prosurvival response in NCS and TNFα cotreated cells， suggests mechanisms through which inflammation could affect resistance and adaptation to radiomimetics despite concurrent induction of death.

Grifolin Induces Cell Death of Human Lung Cancer A549 Cell Line via Inhibiting KRAS-Mediated Multiple Signaling Pathways.,Chem Biodivers, 2024 Jul,38738487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38738487/,In the current work， grifolin was obtained from the twigs and leaves of Daphne genkwa for the first time and displayed significant growth inhibition against human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Subsequent in vitro antitumor evaluation revealed that grifolin could induce remarkable cell apoptosis and G0/G1phase arrest， as well as block cell migration and invasion. In addition， grifolin also disrupted cellular energy metabolism by inducing reactive oxygen species， reducing adenosine triphosphate and mitochondrial membrane potential， and damaging DNA synthesis. Further RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that treatment of grifolin on A549 cells led to gene enrichment in MAPK， PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways， all of which were inhibited by grifolin according to immunoblotting experiments. Further mechanistical studies disclosed that the expression of a key upstream protein KRAS was also blocked， and the cell death triggered by grifolin could be rescued by a RAS activator ML-099. Moreover， pretreatment of ML-099 on A549 cells could reverse the grifolin-induced downregulation of key proteins in the three aforementioned pathways. These findings indicate that grifolin could induce cell death in A549 cell line by inhibiting KRAS-mediated multiple signaling pathways.Keywords:A549; Daphne genkwa; KRAS; antitumor activity; grifolin.

HNF1B inhibits cell proliferation via repression of SMAD6 expression in prostate cancer.,J Cell Mol Med, 2020 Dec,33174391,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33174391/,Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in developed countries. In previous study， we identified HNF1B (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1β) as a downstream effector of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). HNF1B suppresses EZH2-mediated migration of two prostate cancer cell lines via represses the EMT process by inhibiting SLUG expression. Besides， HNF1B expression inhibits cell proliferation through unknown mechanisms. Here， we demonstrated that HNF1B inhibited the proliferation rate of prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of HNF1B in prostate cancer cells led to the arrest of G1 cell cycle and decreased Cyclin D1 expression. In addition， we re-explored data from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)， and demonstrated that HNF1B repressed Cyclin D1 via direct suppression of SMAD6 expression. We also identified CDKN2A as a HNF1B-interacting protein that would contribute to HNF1B-mediated repression of SMAD6 expression. In summary， we provide the novel mechanisms and evidence in support HNF1B as a tumour suppressor gene for prostate cancer.Keywords:CDKN2A; Cyclin D1; HNF1B; SMAD6; proliferation; prostate cancer.

Cell-intrinsic platinum response and associated genetic and gene expression signatures in ovarian cancer cell lines and isogenic models.,bioRxiv [Preprint], 2024 Jul 29,39131380,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39131380/,Ovarian cancers are still largely treated with platinum-based chemotherapy as the standard of care， yet few biomarkers of clinical response have had an impact on clinical decision making as of yet. Two particular challenges faced in mechanistically deciphering platinum responsiveness in ovarian cancer have been the suitability of cell line models for ovarian cancer subtypes and the availability of information on comparatively how sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines are to platinum. We performed one of the most comprehensive profiles to date on 36 ovarian cancer cell lines across over seven subtypes and integrated drug response and multiomic data to improve on our understanding of the best cell line models for platinum responsiveness in ovarian cancer. RNA-seq analysis of the 36 cell lines in a single batch experiment largely conforms with the currently accepted subtyping of ovarian cancers， further supporting other studies that have reclassified cell lines and demonstrate that commonly used cell lines are poor models of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. We performed drug dose response assays in the 32 of these cell lines for cisplatin and carboplatin， providing a quantitative database of IC50s for these drugs. Our results demonstrate that cell lines largely fall either well above or below the equivalent dose of the clinical maximally achievable dose (Cmax) of each compound， allowing designation of cell lines as sensitive or resistant. We performed differential expression analysis for high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines to identify gene expression correlating with platinum-response. Further， we generated two platinum-resistant derivatives each for OVCAR3 and OVCAR4， as well as leveraged clinically-resistant PEO1/PEO4/PEO6 and PEA1/PEA2 isogenic models to perform differential expression analysis for seven total isogenic pairs of platinum resistant cell lines. While gene expression changes overall were heterogeneous and vast， common themes were innate immunity/STAT activation， epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stemness， and platinum influx/efflux regulators. In addition to gene expression analyses， we performed copy number signature analysis and orthogonal measures of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scar scores and copy number burden， which is the first report to our knowledge applying field-standard copy number signatures to ovarian cancer cell lines. We also examined markers and functional readouts of stemness that revealed that cell lines are poor models for examination of stemness contributions to platinum resistance， likely pointing to the fact that this is a transient state. Overall this study serves as a resource to determine the best cell lines to utilize for ovarian cancer research on certain subtypes and platinum response studies， as well as sparks new hypotheses for future study in ovarian cancer.
An in vitro hyaluronic acid hydrogel based platform to model dormancy in brain metastatic breast cancer cells.,Acta Biomater, 2020 Apr 15,32119920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32119920/,Breast cancer cells (BCCs) can remain dormant at the metastatic site， which when revoked leads to formation of metastasis several years after the treatment of primary tumor. Particularly， awakening of dormant BCCs in the brain results in breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBrM) which marks the most advanced stage of the disease with a median survival period of ~4-16 months. However， our understanding of dormancy associated with BCBrM remains obscure， in part， due to the lack of relevant in vitro platforms to model dormancy associated with BCBrM. To address this need， we developed an in vitro hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel platform to model dormancy in brain metastatic BCCs via exploiting the bio-physical cues provided by HA hydrogels while bracketing the normal brain and metastatic brain malignancy relevant stiffness range. In this system， we observed that MDA-MB-231Br and BT474Br3 brain metastatic BCCs exhibited a dormant phenotype when cultured on soft (0.4 kPa) HA hydrogel compared to stiff (4.5 kPa) HA hydrogel as characterized by significantly lower EdU and Ki67 positivity. Further， we demonstrated the nuclear localization of p21 and p27 (markers associated with dormancy) in dormant MDA-MB-231Br cells contrary to their cytoplasmic localization in the proliferative population. We also demonstrated that the stiffness-based dormancy in MDA-MB-231Br cells was reversible and was， in part， mediated by focal adhesion kinases and the initial cell seeding density. Finally， RNA sequencing confirmed the dormant phenotype in MDA-MB-231Br cells. This platform could further our understanding of dormancy in BCBrM and could be adapted for anti-metastatic drug screening. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our understanding of dormancy associated with BCBrM remains obscure， in part， due to the lack of relevant in vitro platforms to model dormancy associated with BCBrM. Herein， we present a HA hydrogel-based platform to model dormancy in brain metastatic BCCs while recapitulating key aspects of brain microenvironment. We demonstrated that the biophysical cues provided the HA hydrogel mediates dormancy in brain metastatic BCCs by assessing both proliferation and cell cycle arrest markers. We also established the role of focal adhesion kinases and initial cell seeding density in the stiffness-mediated dormancy in brain metastatic BCCs. Further， RNA-seq. confirmed the dormant phenotype in brain metastatic BCCs. This platform could be utilized to further our understanding of microenvironmental regulation of dormancy in BCBrM.Keywords:Breast cancer brain metastasis; Cancer dormancy; Hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel; In vitro model.
Restoration of Mesenchymal RPE by Transcription Factor-Mediated Reprogramming.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 2017 Jan 1,28118667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28118667/,Purpose:Transforming growth factor β-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major component of the wound healing response and a negative determinant of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) differentiation. We have shown previously that inhibition of TGFβ signaling restored the capacity of mesenchymal RPE to differentiate; however， the potential lessens with extensive passaging. We investigated TGFβ-independent mechanisms that regulate RPE differentiation following repetitive passaging.Methods:Retinal pigment epithelium-EMT was induced by repetitive passaging of fetal RPE at subconfluence. Suppression of EMT was achieved by the addition of A-83-01， a TGFβ receptor kinase inhibitor. Transcriptomic analysis was used to identify potential TGFβ independent processes that prevent differentiation after extensive passage. Downregulated transcription factors were identified and transduced into highly passaged RPE to restore cell differentiation. Restoration was evaluated according to morphology， expression of RPE/mesenchymal markers， transcriptomic analysis， cell doubling time， and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity.Results:A-83-01-treated RPE failed to differentiate after 7 passages (P7). This failure was concomitant with downregulation of RPE genes， misregulation of cell cycle genes， a decline in proliferative potential， and cell senescence. Exogenous expression of MYCN and OTX2 in conjunction with A-83-01 restored P7-RPE differentiation to a status similar to minimally passaged RPE. Moreover， the treatment allowed cells to maintain their differentiation capacity after extended passaging.Conclusions:Retinal pigment epithelium subjected to chronic wound stimulus undergoes TGFβ-mediated EMT， loss of expression of signature RPE genes， and senescence. Targeting these aspects with a TGFβ receptor kinase inhibitor， a RPE transcription factor， and a cell cycle regulator restores the capacity of highly passaged RPE cells to regenerate and differentiate.
GANT61 suppresses cell survival， invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inactivating AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT3 pathways in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.,Cancer Biol Ther, 2022 Dec 31,35491899,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35491899/,Glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) antagonist-61 (GANT61) not only suppresses the malignant behavior of several cancers but also presents synergistic effects with other anticancer agents on suppressing the progression of cancers， while relevant information is rare in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of GANT61 in ATC and its molecular mechanism. ATC cells (8505C and CAL-62) were treated with GANT61， followed by detection of cell proliferation， apoptosis， invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Subsequently， RNA sequencing was performed to explore the potential downstream pathway. Following that， rescue experiments were conducted by SC79 (AKT activator) or colivelin (STAT3 activator) monotreatment or combined with GANT61 in ATC cells. GANT61 reduced Gli1 expression， suppressed proliferation at several time settings， promoted apoptosis， inhibited invasion and increased E-cadherin while decreased Vimentin and Snail expressions (EMT markers) in ATC cells. The subsequent RNA sequence identified 85 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 71 downregulated DEGs in GANT61-treated ATC cells， which were mainly enriched in PI3K/AKT， JAK/STAT， Hedgehog and mTOR pathways. Next， the inactivation of AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT3 pathways by GANT61 treatment was verified by western blot. The following rescue experiments showed that SC79 or colivelin treatment promoted the malignant behaviors of ATC cells. More importantly， SC79 or colivelin treatment compensated the effect of GANT61 treatment on cell proliferation at several time settings and apoptosis， invasion， and part of that on EMT in ATC cells. GANT61 suppresses cell survival， invasion and EMT through inactivating AKT/mTOR or JAK/STAT3 pathways in ATC.Keywords:AKT/mTOR; GANT61; JAK/STAT3; anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; cell function.
Vitamin D receptor as a target for breast cancer therapy.,Endocr Relat Cancer, 2017 Apr,28213567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28213567/,Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests that high levels of circulating vitamin D (VD) are associated with a decreased incidence and increased survival from cancer， i.e.， VD may possess anti-cancer properties. The aim of this investigation was therefore to investigate the anti-cancer potential of a low calcaemic vitamin D analogue， i.e.， inecalcitol and compare it with the active form of vitamin D， i.e.， calcitriol， in a panel of breast cancer cell lines (n= 15). Using the MTT assay， IC50concentrations for response to calcitriol varied from 0.12 µM to >20 µM， whereas those for inecalcitol were significantly lower， ranging from 2.5 nM to 63 nM (P= 0.001). Sensitivity to calcitriol and inecalcitol was higher in VD receptor (VDR)-positive compared to VDR-negative cell lines (P= 0.0007 and 0.0080， respectively) and in ER-positive compared to ER-negative cell lines (P= 0.043 and 0.005， respectively). Using RNA-seq analysis， substantial but not complete overlap was found between genes differentially regulated by calcitriol and inecalcitol. In particular， significantly enriched gene ontology terms such as cell surface signalling and cell communication were found after treatment with inecalcitol but not with calcitriol. In contrast， ossification and bone morphogenesis were found significantly enriched after treatment with calcitriol but not with inecalcitol. Our preclinical results suggest that calcitriol and inecalcitol can inhibit breast cancer cell line growth， especially in cells expressing ER and VDR. As inecalcitol is significantly more potent than calcitriol and has low calcaemic potential， it should be further investigated for the treatment of breast cancer.Keywords:breast cancer; calcitriol; inecalcitol; oestrogen receptors; vitamin D; vitamin D receptor.
Transcription of the NKG2D ligand MICA is suppressed by the IRE1/XBP1 pathway of the unfolded protein response through the regulation of E2F1.,FASEB J, 2019 Mar,30452881,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30452881/,The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive signaling pathway activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The effectors of the UPR are potent transcription activators; however， some genes are suppressed by ER stress at the mRNA level. The mechanisms underlying UPR-mediated gene suppression are less known. Exploration of the effect of UPR on NK cells ligand expression found that the transcription of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligand major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A/B (MICA/B) is suppressed by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway of the UPR. Deletion of IRE1 or XBP1 was sufficient to promote mRNA and surface levels of MICA. Accordingly， NKG2D played a greater role in the killing of IRE1/XBP1 knockout target cells. Analysis of effectors downstream to XBP1s identified E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) as linking UPR and MICA transcription. The inverse correlation between XBP1 and E2F1 or MICA expression was corroborated in RNA-Seq analysis of 470 primary melanoma tumors. While mechanisms that connect XBP1 to E2F1 are not fully understood， we implicate a few microRNA molecules that are modulated by ER stress and possess dual suppression of E2F1 and MICA. Because of the importance of E2F1 and MICA in cancer progression and recognition， these observations could be exploited for cancer therapy by manipulating the UPR in tumor cells.-Obiedat， A.， Seidel， E.， Mahameed， M.， Berhani， O.， Tsukerman， P.， Voutetakis， K.， Chatziioannou， A.， McMahon， M.， Avril， T.， Chevet， E.， Mandelboim， O.， Tirosh， B.

Effect of CB2 Stimulation on Gene Expression in Pediatric B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: New Possible Targets.,Int J Mol Sci, 2022 Aug 3,35955786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35955786/,ute lymphoblastic leukemia type B (B-ALL) is the most common kind of pediatric leukemia， characterized by the clonal proliferation of type B lymphoid stem cells. Important progress in ALL treatments led to improvements in long-term survival; nevertheless， many adverse long-term consequences still concern the medical community. Molecular and cellular target therapies， together with immunotherapy， are promising strategies to overcome these concerns. Cannabinoids， enzymes involved in their metabolism， and cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) constitute the endocannabinoid system， involved in inflammation， immune response， and cancer. CB2 receptor stimulation exerts anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in many tumors. In this study， we evaluated the effects of CB2 stimulation on B-ALL cell lines， SUP-B15， by RNA sequencing， Western blotting， and ELISA. We observe a lower expression of CB2 in SUP-B15 cells compared to lymphocytes from healthy subjects， hypothesizing its involvement in B-ALL pathogenesis. CB2 stimulation reduces the expression ofCD9，SEC61G，TBX21，andTMSB4Xgenes involved in tumor growth and progression， and also negatively affects downstream intracellular pathways. Our findings suggest an antitumor role of CB2 stimulation in B-ALL， and highlight a functional correlation between CB2 receptors and specific anti-tumoral pathways， even though further investigations are needed.Keywords:CB2 receptors; RNA sequencing; SUP-B15 cell line; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; endocannabinoid system.
Up-regulation of SLC27A2 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of renal cancer by down-regulating CDK3-mediated EMT.,Cell Death Discov, 2022 Aug 4,35927229,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35927229/,
Chemogenomic Landscape of RUNX1-mutated AML Reveals Importance of RUNX1 Allele Dosage in Genetics and Glucocorticoid Sensitivity.,Clin Cancer Res, 2017 Nov 15,28855357,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28855357/,Purpose:RUNX1-mutated (RUNX1mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with adverse outcome， highlighting the urgent need for a better genetic characterization of this AML subgroup and for the design of efficient therapeutic strategies for this disease. Toward this goal， we further dissected the mutational spectrum and gene expression profile ofRUNX1mutAML and correlated these results to drug sensitivity to identify novel compounds targeting this AML subgroup.Experimental Design:RNA-sequencing of 47RUNX1mutprimary AML specimens was performed and sequencing results were compared to those ofRUNX1wild-type samples. Chemical screens were also conducted usingRUNX1mutspecimens to identify compounds selectively affecting the viability ofRUNX1mutAML.Results:We show that samples with no remainingRUNX1wild-type allele are clinically and genetically distinct and display a more homogeneous gene expression profile. Chemical screening revealed that mostRUNX1mutspecimens are sensitive to glucocorticoids (GCs) and we confirmed that GCs inhibit AML cell proliferation through their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We observed that specimens harboringRUNX1mutations expected to result in low residual RUNX1 activity are most sensitive to GCs， and that coassociating mutations as well as GR levels contribute to GC sensitivity. Accordingly， acquired glucocorticoid sensitivity was achieved by negatively regulatingRUNX1expression in human AML cells.Conclusions:Our findings show the profound impact ofRUNX1allele dosage on gene expression profile and glucocorticoid sensitivity in AML， thereby opening opportunities for preclinical testing which may lead to drug repurposing and improved disease characterization.Clin Cancer Res; 23(22); 6969-81. ©2017 AACR.
Mutual regulation of JAG2 and PRAF2 promotes migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells uncoupled from epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,Cancer Cell Int, 2019 Jun 11,31198409,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31198409/,Background:Our previous studies revealed that Jagged 2 (JAG2) is involved in the regulation of migration and invasion of colon cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation. This study further explored the specific mechanism by which JAG2 promotes migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells.Methods:JAG2 mRNA expression in different clinical stages of colorectal cancer and normal intestinal tissues was detected by quantitative PCR (QPCR). QPCR and Western Blot were used to analyze the differential expression of JAG2 mRNA and protein between normal human colon tissue cells and various colorectal cancer cells. Co-expression status of JAG2 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in colon cancer tissues and cells was analyzed. The difference between TGF-β-induced EMT model and the JAG2 overexpression model were compared in promoting migration and invasion of HT29 cells. HT29 cells were treated with EMT pathway inhibitors (LY2157299 and Slug siRNA) to identify a cross-talk between the JAG2 effect and the Notch pathway. Co-expressed genes of JAG2 in colorectal cancer cells were identified using siRNA and transcriptome microarray technology. The mutual regulation of JAG2 and the co-expressed gene PRAF2 and the regulation of the paracrine effect of exosomes were analyzed.Results:JAG2 was abnormally expressed in colorectal cancer tissues and directly related to clinical stages. Similar to the findings in tissues， the expression of both JAG2 mRNA and protein was significantly increased in the colorectal cancer cell lines compared with that of normal colorectal cell line CCD18-Co. It was shown in our cell model that JAG2 was involved in the regulation of migration and invasion independent of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. More interestingly， JAG2 also promoted the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells in a non-EMT pathway. Further analysis revealed the co-expression of JAG2 with PRAF2 in colorectal cancer cells. JAG2-rich exosomes were released from colorectal cancer cells in a PRAF2-dependent way， while these exosomes regulated the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells in a paracrine manner.Conclusions:This is the evidence supporting the biological function of JAG2 through non-canonical Notch and non-EMT-dependent pathways and also the first demonstration of the functions of PRAF2 in colorectal cancer cells. These findings also provide theoretical basis for the development of small molecules or biological agents for therapeutic intervention targeting JAG2/PRAF2.Keywords:Colorectal cancer; Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT); Jagged 2 (JAG2); Notch; PRAF2.
Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Rescue Diabetic Cardiac Dysfuntions in Human iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes.,Adv Biol (Weinh), 2023 Sep,36373695,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36373695/,Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) can improve cardiac function and cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic cardiomyopathy; however， the beneficial effect of GLP-1 on human diabetic cardiomyocytes (DCMs) and its mechanism have not been fully elucidated. Here， the DCMs model by human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes is developed. Two subtypes of GLP-1， GLP-17-36and GLP-19-36， are evaluated for their efficacy on the DCMs model. Diabetogenic condition is sufficient to induce most characteristics of diabetic cardiomyopathy in vitro， such as cardiac hypertrophy， lipid accumulation， impaired calcium transients， and abnormal electrophysiological properties. GLP-17-36and GLP-19-36can restore cardiomyocyte hypertrophic phenotype， impaired calcium transient frequency， abnormal action potential amplitude， depolarization， and repolarization velocity. Interestingly， RNA-seq reveals different pathways altered by GLP-17-36and GLP-19-36， respectively. Differentially expressed gene analysis reveals that possible targets of GLP-17-36involve the regulation of mitotic nuclear division and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction， while possible targets of GLP-19-36involve kinetochore assembly， and the complement and coagulation cascades. This study demonstrates the therapeutic effects of GLP-1 on human DCMs and provides a novel platform to unveil the cellular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy， shedding light on discovering better targets for novel therapeutic interventions.Keywords:diabetic cardiomyopathy; glucagon-like peptide-1; human-induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocyte.
A heparan-sulfate-bearing syndecan-1 glycoform is a distinct surface marker for intra-tumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells.,iScience, 2021 Oct 29,34825135,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34825135/,Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) infiltrate cancer tissue， promote tumor growth， and are associated with resistance to cancer therapies. However， there is no practical approach available to distinguish MDSCs from mature counterparts inside tumors. Here， we show that a recently isolated thioaptamer probe (T1) binds to MDSC subsets in colorectal and pancreatic tumors with high specificity. Whole transcriptome and functional analysis revealed that T1-binding cells contain polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs characterized by several immunosuppression pathways， ROS production， and T cell suppression activity， whereas T1-non-binding PMNs were mature and nonsuppressive. We identified syndecan-1 as the T1-interacting protein on MDSCs and chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cell line. Heparan sulfate chains were essential in T1-binding. Inside tumors PMN-MDSCs expressed heparan sulfate biogenesis enzymes at higher levels. Tumor-cell-derived soluble factor(s) enhanced MDSCs' affinity for T1. Overall， we uncovered heparan-sulfate-dependent MDSC modulation in the tumor microenvironment and identified T1 as tool preferentially targeting tumor-promoting myeloid cell subsets.Keywords:Cell biology; Immunology; Molecular biology.
The significance of ErbB2/3 in the conversion of induced pluripotent stem cells into cancer stem cells.,Sci Rep, 2022 Feb 17,35177646,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35177646/,Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are suggested to be responsible for drug resistance and aggressive phenotypes of tumors. Mechanisms of CSC induction are still under investigation. Our lab has established a novel method to generate CSCs from iPSCs under a cancerous microenvironment mimicked by the conditioned medium (CM) of cancer-derived cells. Here， we analyzed the transcriptome of CSCs， which were converted from iPSCs with CM from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. The differentially expressed genes were identified and used to explore pathway enrichment. From the comparison of the CSCs with iPSCs， genes with elevated expression were related to the ErbB2/3 signaling pathway. Inhibition of either ErbB2 with lapatinib as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or ErbB3 with TX1-85-1 or siRNAs arrested cell proliferation， inhibited the in vitro tumorigenicity， and lead to loss of stemness in the converting cells. The self-renewal and tube formation abilities of cells were also abolished while CD24 and Oct3/4 levels were reduced， and the MAPK pathway was overactivated. This study shows a potential involvement of the ErbB2/ErbB3 pathway in CSC generation and could lead to new insight into the mechanism of tumorigenesis and the way of cancer prevention.
Modulation of cellular migration and survival by c-Myc through the downregulation of urokinase (uPA) and uPA receptor.,Mol Cell Biol, 2010 Apr,20123981,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20123981/,It has been proposed that c-Myc proapoptotic activity accounts for most of its restraint of tumor formation. We established a telomerase-immortalized human epithelial cell line expressing an activatable c-Myc protein. We found that c-Myc activation induces， in addition to increased sensitivity to apoptosis， reductions in cell motility and invasiveness. Transcriptome analysis revealed that urokinase (uPA) and uPA receptor (uPAR) were strongly downregulated by c-Myc. Evidence is provided that the repression of uPA and uPAR may account for most of the antimigratory and proapoptotic activities of c-Myc. c-Myc is known to cooperate with Ras in cellular transformation. We therefore investigated if this cooperation could converge in the control of uPA/uPAR expression. We found that Ras is able to block the effects of c-Myc activation on apoptosis and cellular motility but not on cell invasiveness. Accordingly， the activation of c-Myc in the context of Ras expression had only minor influence on uPAR expression but still had a profound repressive effect on uPA expression. Thus， the differential regulation of uPA and uPAR by c-Myc and Ras correlates with the effects of these two oncoproteins on cell motility， invasiveness， and survival. In conclusion， we have discovered a novel link between c-Myc and uPA/uPAR. We propose that reductions of cell motility and invasiveness could contribute to the inhibition of tumorigenesis by c-Myc and that the regulation of uPA and uPAR expression may be a component of the ability of c-Myc to reduce motility and invasiveness.
Explore the alterations of downstream molecular pathways caused by ARID1A mutation/knockout in human endometrial cancer cells.,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol, 2023 Dec,37906351,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37906351/,Purpose:As one of the most common gynecologic malignancies， endometrial cancer (EC) is driven by multiple genetic alterations that may be targeted for treatments. AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) gene mutations were reported as early events in endometrial carcinogenesis.Methods:To explore the alterations of downstream molecular pathways caused by ARID1A mutations and the associated therapeutic implications， we edited ARID1A gene in human endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-Associated Proteins (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. We successfully constructed a stable Ishikawa cell line with a confirmed 10 bp deletion on the ARID1A gene， which resulted in a code-shift mutation and gene knockout.Results:Compared with unedited wild-type cells， ARID1A knockout (KO) led to reduced apoptosis， accelerated transformation from G0/G1 to S phase， and enhanced cell proliferation. ARID1A deficiency would reduce the protein levels of p21， caspase 7， and caspase 9 in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells compared with the wild-type cells. In addition， ARID1A KO resulted in high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Moreover， transcriptomic analyses showed that ARID1A KO can lead to activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. Furthermore， experimental analyses demonstrated that ARID1A KO cells had reduced expression of genetic instability-associated markers mutL homologue 1 (MLH1) and progesterone receptor B (PR) and increased p-Akt expression.Conclusion:These findings support further exploration of ARID1A as a therapeutic target for EC and provide insight into developing more effective treatments in EC， such as the combinatory use of immune checkpoint inhibitors.Keywords:AT-rich interaction domain 1A; CRISPR/Cas9; Cell cycle; Endometrial cancer; Microsatellite instability; PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
3D microengineered vascularized tumor spheroids for drug delivery and efficacy testing.,Acta Biomater, 2023 Jul 15,36243378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36243378/,Tumor angiogenesis is regarded as a promising target for limiting cancer progression because tumor-associated vasculature supplies blood and provides a path for metastasis. Thus， in vitro recapitulation of vascularized tumors is critical to understand the pathology of cancer and identify the mechanisms by which tumor cells proliferate， metastasize， and respond to drugs. In this study， we microengineered a vascularized tumor spheroid (VTS) model to reproduce the pathological features of solid tumors. We first generated tumor-EC hybrid spheroids with self-assembled intratumoral vessels， which enhanced the uniformity of the spheroids and peritumoral angiogenic capacity compared to spheroids composed only with cancer cells. Notably， the hybrid spheroids also exhibited expression profiles associated with aggressive behavior. The blood vessels sprouting around the hybrid spheroids on the VTS chip displayed the distinctive characteristics of leaky tumor vessels. With the VTS chip showing a progressive tumor phenotype， we validated the suppressive effects of axitinib on tumor growth and angiogenesis， which depended on exposure dose and time， highlighting the significance of tumor vascularization to predict the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Ultimately， we effectively induced both lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis around the tumor spheroid by promoting interstitial flow. Thus， our VTS model is a valuable platform with which to investigate the interactions between tumor microenvironments and explore therapeutic strategies in cancer.

Thrombin receptor and RhoA mediate cell proliferation through integrins and cysteine-rich protein 61.,FASEB J, 2008 Nov,18687805,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18687805/, subset of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)， including the thrombin receptor (PAR1)， elicits mitogenic responses. Thrombin also activates Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and activating protein (AP-1) -mediated gene expression in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells， whereas the nonmitogenic agonist carbachol does not. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore differential gene induction by these agonists and revealed that the matricellular protein cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) is selectively induced by thrombin. The ability of GPCR agonists to induce Cyr61 parallels their ability to activate RhoA; agonist-stimulated Cyr61 expression is inhibited by C3 toxin. When Cyr61 is down-regulated using short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)， thrombin-induced DNA synthesis is significantly attenuated. When Cyr61 expression is induced， it appears in the extracellular compartment and on the cell surface. Extracellular Cyr61 interacts with alpha(5)， alpha(6)， and beta(1) integrins on these cells， and monoclonal antibodies directed against alpha(5) and beta(1) integrins inhibit thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. Functional blockade of Cyr61 with soluble heparin or anti-Cyr61 antibodies also inhibits thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. Thus Cyr61 is a highly inducible， secreted extracellular factor through which GPCR and RhoA signaling pathways engage integrins that contribute to GPCR-mediated proliferation.
Store-operated calcium entry mediates hyperalgesic responses during neuropathy.,FEBS Open Bio, 2023 Nov,37606998,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606998/,Neuropathic pain (NP)， resulting from nerve injury， alters neural plasticity in spinal cord and brain via the release of inflammatory mediators. The remodeling of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) involves the refilling of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum via STIM1 and Orai1 proteins and is crucial for maintaining neural plasticity and neurotransmitter release. The mechanism underlying SOCE-mediated NP remains largely unknown. In this study， we found SOCE-mediated calcium refilling was significantly higher during neuropathic pain， and the major component Orai1 was specifically co-localized with neuronal markers. Intrathecal injection of SOCE antagonist SKF96365 remarkably alleviated nerve injury- and formalin-induced pain and suppressed c-Fos expression in response to innocuous mechanical stimulation. RNA sequencing revealed that SKF96365 altered the expression of spinal transcription factors， including Fos， Junb， and Socs3， during neuropathic pain. In order to identify the genes critical for SKF96365-induced effects， we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the genes most correlated with paw withdrawal latency phenotypes. Of the 16 modules， MEsalmon module was the most highly correlated with SKF96365 induced effects. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the enriched genes of MEsalmon module were significantly related to Toll-like receptor signaling， steroid biosynthesis， and chemokine signaling， which may mediate the analgesic effect caused by SKF9636 treatment. Additionally， the SOCE antagonist YM-58483 produced similar analgesic effects in nerve injury- and formalin-induced pain. Our results suggest that manipulation of spinal SOCE signaling might be a promising target for pain relief by regulating neurotransmitter production and spinal transcription factor expression.Keywords:SKF96365; SOCE; YM-58483; neuronal activity; neuropathy; store-operated calcium entry.
LINC02489 with m6a modification increase paclitaxel sensitivity by inhibiting migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells.,Biotechnol Genet Eng Rev, 2023 Oct,36703541,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36703541/,The long non-coding RNA LINC02489 has been shown to be significantly downregulated in advanced ovarian cancer (OC). However， the function of LINC02489 remains unknown. This study aims to explain the role and mechanism of LINC02489 in OC. The expression of LINC02489 was examined by qRT-PCR in primary OC tissues. Additionally， MTT， wound healing， transwell， and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze the function of LINC02489. The mechanism of LINC02489 in OC was investigated by high-throughput RNA-sequencing， qRT-PCR， western blot， and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) meRIP. A total of 1101 and 827 genes are significantly down-regulated and up-regulated in metastatic and chemoresistant OC tissues. The expression of LINC02489 is decreased in metastatic and chemoresistant OC tissues compared with the primary OC tissues (p< 0.05). Overexpression of LINC02489 inhibits proliferation， invasion， and migration of drug-resistant OC cells. In the LINC02489 overexpressed chemoresistant SKOV3 cells， the m6A modified LINC02489 is significantly up-regulated. Furthermore， the expression of PKNOX2 is increased during overexpression of LINC02489， while the expression of PTEN and mTOR plummets. This study demonstrates that LINC02489 can inhibit the invasion and migration of chemoresistant OC cells by increasing its m6A modification and up-regulating PKNOX2 expression.

Identifying FDA-approved drugs with multimodal properties against COVID-19 using a data-driven approach and a lung organoid model of SARS-CoV-2 entry.,Mol Med, 2021 Sep 9,34503440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34503440/,Background:Vaccination programs have been launched worldwide to halt the spread of COVID-19. However， the identification of existing， safe compounds with combined treatment and prophylactic properties would be beneficial to individuals who are waiting to be vaccinated， particularly in less economically developed countries， where vaccine availability may be initially limited.Methods:We used a data-driven approach， combining results from the screening of a large transcriptomic database (L1000) and molecular docking analyses， with in vitro tests using a lung organoid model of SARS-CoV-2 entry， to identify drugs with putative multimodal properties against COVID-19.Results:Out of thousands of FDA-approved drugs considered， we observed that atorvastatin was the most promising candidate， as its effects negatively correlated with the transcriptional changes associated with infection. Atorvastatin was further predicted to bind to SARS-CoV-2's main protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase， and was shown to inhibit viral entry in our lung organoid model.Conclusions:Small clinical studies reported that general statin use， and specifically， atorvastatin use， are associated with protective effects against COVID-19. Our study corroborrates these findings and supports the investigation of atorvastatin in larger clinical studies. Ultimately， our framework demonstrates one promising way to fast-track the identification of compounds for COVID-19， which could similarly be applied when tackling future pandemics.Keywords:Atorvastatin; COVID-19; Chemoinformatics; Connectivity mapping; Drug repositioning; Drug screening; Drug testing; Lung organoids; Molecular docking; Pandemic.
Functional Characterization of Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling in Dasatinib Resistance and Pre-BCR+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Cancers (Basel), 2023 Aug 30,37686604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37686604/,The multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib has been implicated to be effective in pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) expressing the E2A-PBX1 fusion oncoprotein. The TGFβ signaling pathway is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes， including embryonic development and cell homeostasis， and it can have dual roles in cancer: suppressing tumor growth at early stages and mediating tumor progression at later stages. In this study， we identified the upregulation of the TGFβ signaling pathway in our previously generated human dasatinib-resistant pre-BCR+/E2A-PBX1+ALL cells using global transcriptomic analysis. We confirm the upregulation of the TGFβ pathway member SMAD3 at the transcriptional and translational levels in dasatinib-resistant pre-BCR+/E2A-PBX1+ALL cells. Hence， dasatinib blocks， at least partially， TGFβ-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation in several B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cell lines as well as in dasatinib-resistant pre-BCR+/E2A-PBX1+ALL cells. Activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway by TGF-β1 leads to growth inhibition by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 stage， increase in apoptosis and transcriptional changes of SMAD-targeted genes， e.g. c-MYC downregulation， in pre-BCR+/E2A-PBX1+ ALL cells. These results provide a better understanding about the role that the TGFβ signaling pathway plays in leukemogenesis of BCP-ALL as well as in secondary drug resistance to dasatinib.Keywords:B-cell precursors; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; dasatinib; drug resistance; transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway.
Transcriptional Modulation of Human Endogenous Retroviruses in Primary CD4+ T Cells Following Vorinostat Treatment.,Front Immunol, 2018 Apr 12,29706951,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29706951/,"The greatest obstacle to a cure for HIV is the provirus that integrates into the genome of the infected cell and persists despite antiretroviral therapy. A ""shock and kill"" approach has been proposed as a strategy for an HIV cure whereby drugs and compounds referred to as latency-reversing agents (LRAs) are used to ""shock"" the silent provirus into active replication to permit ""killing"" by virus-induced pathology or immune recognition. The LRA most utilized to date in clinical trials has been the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-vorinostat. Potentially， pathological off-target effects of vorinostat may result from the activation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)， which share common ancestry with exogenous retroviruses including HIV. To explore the effects of HDAC inhibition on HERV transcription， an unbiased pharmacogenomics approach (total RNA-Seq) was used to evaluate HERV expression following the exposure of primary CD4+T cells to a high dose of vorinostat. Over 2，000 individual HERV elements were found to be significantly modulated by vorinostat， whereby elements belonging to the ERVL family (e.g.， LTR16C and LTR33) were predominantly downregulated， in contrast to LTR12 elements of the HERV-9 family， which exhibited the greatest signal， with the upregulation of 140 distinct elements. The modulation of three different LTR12 elements by vorinostat was confirmed by droplet digital PCR along a dose-response curve. The monitoring of LTR12 expression during clinical trials with vorinostat may be indicated to assess the impact of this HERV on the human genome and host immunity.Keywords:histone deacetylase inhibitor; human endogenous retroviruses; long terminal repeat; primary CD4+ T cells; total RNA-Seq."
Zinc complex of 3，5-di-tert-butyl salicylate inhibits viability， migration， and invasion in triple-negative breast cancer cells.,Sci Rep, 2022 Mar 16,35296801,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35296801/,The zinc complex of 3，5-di-tert-butyl salicylate (Zn{[CH3)3C]2Sal}22-) is a zinc ion chelate of salicylate. In this study， we found that this compound inhibits viability， invasion， and migration and induces apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer 4T1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the expression of 17 genes was upregulated and 26 genes were downregulated significantly by Zn{[CH3)3C]2Sal}22-treatment. Further GO and KEGG analysis showed that the activity of Zn{[CH3)3C]2Sal}22-against triple-negative breast cancer cells may be involved in the JAK-STAT3， HIF-1， and TNF signaling pathways. The expression of key genes was verified by RT-PCR. The phosphorylation of STAT3 and its upstream SRC decreased drastically upon Zn{[CH3)3C]2Sal}22-treatment， as demonstrated by western blot. Our results indicate that Zn{[CH3)3C]2Sal}22-inhibits the activity of TNBC cells by downregulating the STAT3 signaling through the SRC pathway.

A network-centric approach to drugging TNF-induced NF-κB signaling.,Nat Commun, 2019 Feb 26,30808860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30808860/,Target-centric drug development strategies prioritize single-target potency in vitro and do not account for connectivity and multi-target effects within a signal transduction network. Here， we present a systems biology approach that combines transcriptomic and structural analyses with live-cell imaging to predict small molecule inhibitors of TNF-induced NF-κB signaling and elucidate the network response. We identify two first-in-class small molecules that inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway by preventing the maturation of a rate-limiting multiprotein complex necessary for IKK activation. Our findings suggest that a network-centric drug discovery approach is a promising strategy to evaluate the impact of pharmacologic intervention in signaling.
Chk1 inhibitor-induced DNA damage increases BFL1 and decreases BIM but does not protect human cancer cell lines from Chk1 inhibitor-induced apoptosis.,Am J Cancer Res, 2022 May 15,35693081,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35693081/,V158411 is a potent， selective Chk1 inhibitor currently in pre-clinical development. We utilised RNA-sequencing to evaluate the gene responses to V158411 treatment. BCL2A1 was highly upregulated in U2OS cells in response to V158411 treatment with BCL2A1 mRNA increased > 400-fold in U2OS but not HT29 cells. Inhibitors of Chk1， Wee1 and topoisomerases but not other DNA damaging agents or inhibitors of ATR， ATM or DNA-PKcs increased BFL1 and decreased BIM protein. Increased BFL1 appeared limited to a subset of approximately 35% of U2OS cells. Out of 24 cell lines studied， U2OS cells were unique in being the only cell line with low basal BFL1 levels to be increased in response to DNA damage. Induction of BFL1 in U2OS cells appeared dependent on PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MEK pathway signalling but independent of NF-κB transcription factors. Inhibitors of MEK， mTOR and PI3K effectively blocked the increase in BFL1 following V15841 treatment. Increased BFL1 expression did not block apoptosis in U2OS cells in response to V158411 treatment and cells with high basal expression of BFL1 readily underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis following Chk1 inhibitor therapy. BFL1 induction in response to Chk1 inhibition appeared to be a rare event that was dependent on MEK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling.Keywords:BFL1; Chk1; DNA damage; MEK; kinase inhibitor.
The common oncogenomic program of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,PLoS One, 2017 Oct 12,29023469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29023469/,Notch is a major oncogenic driver in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)， in part because it binds to an enhancer that increases expression of MYC. Here， we exploit the capacity of activated NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 to induce T-ALL， despite substantial divergence in their intracellular regions， as a means to elucidate a broad， common Notch-dependent oncogenomic program through systematic comparison of the transcriptomes and Notch-bound genomic regulatory elements of NOTCH1- and NOTCH3-dependent T-ALL cells. ChIP-seq studies show a high concordance of functional NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 genomic binding sites that are enriched in binding motifs for RBPJ， the transcription factor that recruits activated Notch to DNA. The interchangeability of NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 was confirmed by rescue of NOTCH1-dependent T-ALL cells with activated NOTCH3 and vice versa. Despite remarkable overall similarity， there are nuanced differences in chromatin landscapes near critical common Notch target genes， most notably at a Notch-dependent enhancer that regulates MYC， which correlates with responsiveness to Notch pathway inhibitors. Overall， a common oncogenomic program driven by binding of either Notch is sufficient to maintain T-ALL cell growth， whereas cell-context specific differences appear to influence the response of T-ALL cells to Notch inhibition.

The role of A-kinase interacting protein 1 in regulating progression and stemness as well as indicating the prognosis in glioblastoma.,Transl Oncol, 2022 Aug,35691247,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35691247/,Background:A-kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) is recently implicated in the pathogenesis of several solid tumors， while its role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is largely unknown. Therefore， the current study aimed to investigate the effect of AKIP1 on GBM cell malignant behaviors， stemness， and its underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:U-87 MG and A172 cells were transfected with control or AKIP1 overexpression plasmid; control or AKIP1 siRNA plasmid. Then cell proliferation， apoptosis， invasion， CD133+cell proportion， and sphere formation assays were performed. Furthermore， RNA-Seq was performed in U-87 MG cells. Besides， AKIP1 expression was detected in 25 GBM and 25 low-grade glioma (LGG) tumor samples.Results:AKIP1 was increased in several GBM cell lines compared to the control cell line. After transfections， it was found that AKIP1 overexpression increased cell invasion， CD133+cell proportion， and sphere formation ability while less affecting cell proliferation or cell apoptosis in U-87 MG and A172 cells. Moreover， AKIP1 siRNA achieved the opposite effect in these cells， except that it inhibited cell proliferation but induced cell apoptosis to some extent. Subsequent RNA-Seq assay showed several critical carcinogenetic pathways， such as PI3K/AKT， Notch， EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance， Ras， ErbB， mTOR pathways， etc. were potentially related to the function of AKIP1 in U-87 MG cells. Clinically， AKIP1 expression was higher in GBM tissues than in LGG tissues， which was also correlated with the poor prognosis of GBM to some degree.Conclusions:AKIP1 regulates the malignant behaviors and stemness of GBM via regulating multiple carcinogenetic pathways.Keywords:AKIP1; Glioblastoma multiforme; Malignant behaviors; RNA-seq; Stemness.

A three-dimensional spheroid-specific role for Wnt-β-catenin and Eph-ephrin signaling in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.,J Cell Sci, 2021 Aug 15,34338780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34338780/,One of the greatest unmet needs hindering the successful treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) is for representative physiological and cost-effective models. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is consistently present in NPCs， most studies have focused on EBV-negative NPCs. For the first time， we established and analyzed three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models of EBV-positive and EBV-negative NPC cells and compared these to classical two-dimensional (2D) cultures in various aspects of tumor phenotype and drug responses. Compared to 2D monolayers， the 3D spheroids showed significant increases in migration capacity， stemness characteristics， hypoxia and drug resistance. Co-culture with endothelial cells， which mimics essential interactions in the tumor microenvironment， effectively enhanced spheroid dissemination. Furthermore， RNA sequencing revealed significant changes at the transcriptional level in 3D spheroids compared to expression in 2D monolayers. In particular， we identified known (VEGF， AKT and mTOR) and novel (Wnt-β-catenin and Eph-ephrin) cell signaling pathways that are activated in NPC spheroids. Targeting these pathways in 3D spheroids using FDA-approved drugs was effective in monoculture and co-culture. These findings provide the first demonstration of the establishment of EBV-positive and EBV-negative NPC 3D spheroids with features that resemble advanced and metastatic NPCs. Furthermore， we show that NPC spheroids have potential use in identifying new drug targets.Keywords:2D monolayer; 3D spheroids; Drug response; Microenvironment; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Insights into the mechanisms and structure of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles in cervical cancer using long-read sequencing.,Am J Hum Genet, 2024 Mar 7,38307027,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38307027/,Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection， has few approved targeted therapeutics， and is the most common cause of cancer death in low-resource countries. We characterized 19 cervical and four head and neck cancer cell lines using long-read DNA and RNA sequencing and identified the HPV types， HPV integration sites， chromosomal alterations， and cancer driver mutations. Structural variation analysis revealed telomeric deletions associated with DNA inversions resulting from breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. BFB is a common mechanism of chromosomal alterations in cancer， and our study applies long-read sequencing to this important chromosomal rearrangement type. Analysis of the inversion sites revealed staggered ends consistent with exonuclease digestion of the DNA after breakage. Some BFB events are complex， involving inter- or intra-chromosomal insertions or rearrangements. None of the BFB breakpoints had telomere sequences added to resolve the dicentric chromosomes， and only one BFB breakpoint showed chromothripsis. Five cell lines have a chromosomal region 11q BFB event， with YAP1-BIRC3-BIRC2 amplification. Indeed， YAP1 amplification is associated with a 10-year-earlier age of diagnosis of cervical cancer and is three times more common in African American women. This suggests that individuals with cervical cancer and YAP1-BIRC3-BIRC2 amplification， especially those of African ancestry， might benefit from targeted therapy. In summary， we uncovered valuable insights into the mechanisms and consequences of BFB cycles in cervical cancer using long-read sequencing.Keywords:HPV integration; YAP1; breakage-bridge-fusion events; cervical cancer; chromothripsis; extrachromosomal DNA; human papillomavirus; long-read sequencing.

Diminazene resistance in Trypanosoma congolense is not caused by reduced transport capacity but associated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential.,Mol Microbiol, 2021 Aug,33932053,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33932053/,Trypanosoma congolense is a principal agent causing livestock trypanosomiasis in Africa， costing developing economies billions of dollars and undermining food security. Only the diamidine diminazene and the phenanthridine isometamidium are regularly used， and resistance is widespread but poorly understood. We induced stable diminazene resistance in T. congolense strain IL3000 in vitro. There was no cross-resistance with the phenanthridine drugs， melaminophenyl arsenicals， oxaborole trypanocides， or with diamidine trypanocides， except the close analogs DB829 and DB75. Fluorescence microscopy showed that accumulation of DB75 was inhibited by folate. Uptake of [3H]-diminazene was slow with low affinity and partly but reciprocally inhibited by folate and by competing diamidines. Expression of T. congolense folate transporters in diminazene-resistant Trypanosoma brucei brucei significantly sensitized the cells to diminazene and DB829， but not to oxaborole AN7973. However， [3H]-diminazene transport studies， whole-genome sequencing， and RNA-seq found no major changes in diminazene uptake， folate transporter sequence， or expression. Instead， all resistant clones displayed a moderate reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential Ψm. We conclude that diminazene uptake in T. congolense proceed via multiple low affinity mechanisms including folate transporters; while resistance is associated with a reduction in Ψm it is unclear whether this is the primary cause of the resistance.Keywords:Isometamidium; diminazene aceturate; nagana; oxaborole; resistance.

Emodin-Induced Necroptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells via the Mitochondrial Fission HSP90/MLKL/PGAM Pathway.,Chem Biodivers, 2023 Jun,37062702,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37062702/,Currently， prostate cancer is one of the major malignant tumors in males. Recurrence and metastasis are the main obstacles that prevent the effective treatment of prostate cancer. In the present study， we aimed to evaluate emodin (EG) against human prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells. Our study showed that EG significantly decreased the cell viability of PC3 and DU145 cells and strikingly induced non-apoptotic cell death via necroptosis that was visualized through colony formation assay， Hoechst 33258 staining， and TEM analysis. Furthermore， RNA-sequencing and KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed that the necroptosis-related pathway was activated upon EG treatment in PC3 cells. mRNA and protein expression of necroptosis markers were analyzed by qPCR and immunoblotting， which implied that EG-induced cell necroptosis via enhancing the expression of MLKL and HSP90AA1 activating PGAM pathway which is considered as a key mediator of mitochondrial fission and leading to ROS generation in PC3 and DU145 cells. Thus， our findings suggested that EG is a new small molecule agonist that induced necroptosis in prostate cancer cells via the mitochondrial fission HSP90/MLKL/PGAM pathway.Keywords:HSP90; PGAM; emodin; necroptosis; prostate cancer.

LncRNA-42060 Regulates Tamoxifen Sensitivity and Tumor Development via Regulating the miR-204-5p/SOX4 Axis in Canine Mammary Gland Tumor Cells.,Front Vet Sci, 2021 Jun 21,34235197,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34235197/,Tamoxifen is the drug of choice for endocrine therapy of breast cancer. Its clinical use is limited by the development of drug resistance. There is increasing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with tumor drug resistance. Therefore， we established two TAM-resistant cell lines， CHMpTAMand CHMmTAM. The different expression levels of lncRNA and miRNA in CHMmTAMand CHMm were screened by RNA sequencing， and the lncRNA-miRNA interactions were analyzed. LncRNA ENSCAFG42060 (lnc-42060) was found to be significantly upregulated in drug-resistant cells and tumor tissues. Further functional validation revealed that the knockdown of lnc-42060 inhibited proliferation， migration， clone formation， restoration of TAM sensitivity， and reduction of stem cell formation in drug-resistant cells， whereas overexpression of lnc-4206 showed opposite results. Bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed that lnc-42060 could act as a sponge for miR-204-5p， further regulating SOX4 expression activity and thus influencing tumor cell progression. In conclusion， we screened lncRNAs and miRNAs associated with TAM resistance in canine mammary gland tumor cells for the first time. lnc-42060 served as a novel marker that may be used as an important biomarker for future diagnosis and treatment.Keywords:Sox4; canine mammary gland tumor; lncRNA; miR-204-5p; tamoxifen-resistant.

Precision cut intestinal slices， a novel model of acute food allergic reactions.,Allergy, 2023 Feb,36377289,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36377289/,Background:Food allergy affects up to 10% of the pediatric population. Despite ongoing efforts， treatment options remain limited. Novel models of food allergy are needed to study response patterns downstream of IgE-crosslinking and evaluate drugs modifying acute events. Here， we report a novel human ex vivo model that displays acute， allergen-specific， IgE-mediated smooth muscle contractions using precision cut intestinal slices (PCIS).Methods:PCIS were generated using gut tissue samples from children who underwent clinically indicated surgery. Viability and metabolic activity were assessed from 0 to 24 h. Distribution of relevant cell subsets was confirmed using single nucleus RNA sequencing. PCIS were passively sensitized using plasma from peanut allergic donors or peanut-sensitized non-allergic donors， and exposed to various stimuli including serotonin， histamine， FcɛRI-crosslinker， and food allergens. Smooth muscle contractions and mediator release functioned as readouts. A novel program designed to measure contractions was developed to quantify responses. The ability to demonstrate the impact of antihistamines and immunomodulation from peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) was assessed.Results:PCIS viability was maintained for 24 h. Cellular distribution confirmed the presence of key cell subsets including mast cells. The video analysis tool reliably quantified responses to different stimulatory conditions. Smooth muscle contractions were allergen-specific and reflected the clinical phenotype of the plasma donor. Tryptase measurement confirmed IgE-dependent mast cell-derived mediator release. Antihistamines suppressed histamine-induced contraction and plasma from successful peanut OIT suppressed peanut-specific PCIS contraction.Conclusion:PCIS represent a novel human tissue-based model to study acute， IgE-mediated food allergy and pharmaceutical impacts on allergic responses in the gut.Keywords:PCIS; allergy model; food allergy; intestine; precision cut intestinal slices.

Integrated analysis of high-throughput sequencing data reveals the key role of LINC00467 in the invasion and metastasis of testicular germ cell tumors.,Cell Death Discov, 2021 Aug 6,34362879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34362879/,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various physiological and pathological processes. However， the role of lncRNAs in testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) has been rarely reported. Our purpose is to comprehensively survey the expression and function of lncRNAs in TGCT. In this study， we used RNA sequencing to construct the lncRNA expression profiles of 13 TGCT tissues and 4 paraneoplastic tissues to explore the function of lncRNAs in TGCT. The bioinformatics analysis showed that many lncRNAs are differentially expressed in TGCT. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs participated in various biological processes associated with tumorigenesis in cis and trans manners. Further， we found that the expression of LINC00467 was positively correlated with the poor prognosis and pathological grade of TGCT using WGCNA analysis and GEPIA database data mining. In vitro experiments revealed that LNC00467 could promote the migration and invasion of TGCT cells by regulating the expression of AKT3 and influencing total AKT phosphorylation. Further analysis of TCGA data revealed that the expression was negatively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and the response to PD1 immunotherapy. In summary， this study is the first to construct the expression profile of lncRNAs in TGCT. It is also the first study to identify the metastasis-promoting role of LNC00467， which can be used as a potential predictor of TGCT prognosis and immunotherapeutic response to provide a clinical reference for the treatment and diagnosis of TGCT metastasis.
Tunicamycin promotes metastasis through upregulating endoplasmic reticulum stress induced GRP78 expression in thyroid carcinoma.,Cell Biosci, 2020 Oct 1,33014334,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33014334/,Background:Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common type of endocrine malignancy and its incidence is increasing over years. Conventional surgery， radiotherapy and chemotherapy are difficult to improve the significant effects of it due to aggression and metastasis of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC)， and these are regarded as the most malignant types of TC. Glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is the key molecule of tumor growth， apoptosis and metastasis. However， the underlying mechanisms of GRP78 in TC still require discussion. This study aimed to explore the role of GRP78 and its potential mechanism in TC.Results:GRP78 expression was increased in TC tissues when compared with adjacent normal tissues. Besides， down-regulation of GRP78 significantly inhibited the metastatic and proliferative ability of ATC cells in in vitro studies. In addition， tunicamycin-induced ER stress up-regulated the expression of GRP78， PERK and XBP1 as well as reversed the metastatic ability of GRP78 in ATC cells. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis of gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for RNA-sequencing data with regard to si-GRP78 and si-control showed that GRP78 might regulate the ability of metastasis through extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in ATC cells， as well as the expression of ECM components such as COL1A1 and MMP13， which were highly relevant to ATC cells. The analysis of GEPIA database confirmed that high genomic amplification of MMP13 and COL1A1 in TC tissues showed correlation with TNM stage. Further western blotting analysis showed that MMP13 might be the target of GRP78 in ATC cells and ER stress could activate the expression of MMP13 that is suppressed by GRP78 depletion.Conclusions:GRP78 acts as an important regulator of metastasis under ER stress.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor antigens， such as rituximab (targeting CD20)， induce NK cell-mediated ADCC and have been used to treat B cell malignancies， such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma， but not always successfully. The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression profile of the NK cells involved in the cytolytic response stimulated by rituximab. NK cells were co-cultured with rituximab-opsonized Raji cells. Sorting into responder and non-responder groups was based on the presence of CD107a， which is a degranulation marker. RNA-seq results showed that theKITandTNFSF4genes were strongly down-regulated in the degranulating population of NK cells (responders); this was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Both genes encode surface proteins with cellular signaling abilities， namely c-KIT and the OX40 ligand. Consistent with our findings， c-KIT was previously reported to correlate inversely with cytokine production by activated NK cells. The significance of these findings for cancer immunotherapy seems essential， as the pharmacological inhibition of c-KIT and OX40L， or gene ablation， could be further tested for the enhancement of the anti-tumor activity of NK cells in response to rituximab.Keywords:Burkitt lymphoma; CD16; NK cells; OX40L; c-KIT; mAbs; rituximab.
Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Conditioned Medium Improves Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Suppresses Apoptosis in Okadaic Acid-Treated SH-SY5Y Cells by Extracellular Vesicle Mitochondrial Transfer.,J Alzheimers Dis, 2020,33104031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33104031/,Background:Mesenchymal stem cells-conditioned medium (MSC-CM) provides a promising cell-free therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) mainly due to the paracrine of MSCs， but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Studies suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction precedes the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles， and involves in the onset and development of AD.Objective:In the present study， we evaluated the protective effects and explored the related-mitochondrial mechanisms of human umbilical cord derived MSC-CM (hucMSC-CM) in an AD model in vitro.Methods:To this end， an AD cellular model was firstly established by okadaic acid (OA)-treated SH-SY5Y cells， and then treated by hucMSC-CM to assess the oxidative stress， mitochondrial function， apoptosis， AD-related genes， and signaling pathways.Results:hucMSC-CM significantly deceased tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (p181-tau) level， which was increased in AD. hucMSC-CM also alleviated intracellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress in OA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. In addition， hucMSC-CM suppressed apoptosis and improved mitochondrial function in OA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that hucMSC-CM exerted the protective effects relying on or partly extracellular vesicle (EV) mitochondrial transfer from hucMSCs to OA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover， RNA sequencing data further demonstrated that hucMSC-CM regulated many AD-related genes， signaling pathways and mitochondrial function.Conclusion:These results indicated that MSC-CM or MSC-EVs containing abundant mitochondria may provide a novel potential therapeutic approach for AD.Keywords:Alzheimer’s disease; apoptosis; mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial transfer.
Galactomannan-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype in human macrophages.,J Mater Chem B, 2023 Sep 13,37587844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37587844/,Macrophages are immune cells that can be activated into either pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Attempts to modulate macrophage phenotype using drugs have been limited by targeting issues and systemic toxicity. This study investigates the effect of drug-free self-assembled hydrolyzed galactomannan-poly(methyl methacrylate) (hGM-g-PMMA) nanoparticles on the activation of the human monocyte-derived macrophage THP-1 cell line. Nanoparticles are cell compatible and are taken up by macrophages. RNA-sequencing analysis of cells exposed to NPs reveal the upregulation of seven metallothionein genes. Additionally， the secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines upon exposure of unpolarized macrophages and M1-like cells obtained by activation with lipopolysaccharide + interferon-γ to the NPs is reduced and increased， respectively. Finally， nanoparticle-treated macrophages promote fibroblast migrationin vitro. Overall， results demonstrate that hGM-g-PMMA nanoparticles induce the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines by THP-1 macrophages， which could pave the way for their application in the therapy of different inflammatory conditions， especially by local delivery.
Pacritinib inhibits proliferation of primary effusion lymphoma cells and production of viral interleukin-6 induced cytokines.,Sci Rep, 2024 Feb 19,38374336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38374336/,Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a form of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) are both caused by Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). There is a critical need for improved therapies for these disorders. The IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both PEL and KSHV-MCD. We explored the potential of JAK inhibitors for use in PEL and KSHV-MCD， and found that pacritinib was superior to others in inhibiting the growth of PEL cell lines. Pacritinib induced apoptosis in PEL cells and inhibited STAT3 and NF-κB activity as evidenced by reduced amount of phosphorylated moieties. Pacritinib also inhibits FLT3， IRAK1， and ROS1; studies utilizing other inhibitors of these targets revealed that only FLT3 inhibitors exhibited similar cell growth inhibitory effects. FLT3's likely contribution to pacritinib's cell growth inhibition was further demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of FLT3. RNA sequencing and RT-PCR showed that many key host genes including cyclins and IL-6 were downregulated by pacritinib， while KSHV genes were variably altered. Finally， pacritinib suppressed KSHV viral IL-6-induced human IL-6 and IL-10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells， which may model an important step in KSHV-MCD pathogenesis. These results suggest that pacritinib warrants testing for the treatment of KSHV-MCD and PEL.
Rapid in vitro evolution of flucytosine resistance in Candida auris.,mSphere, 2025 Mar 18,40099908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40099908/,The pan-antifungal-resistant pathogenCandida aurishas been causing high-mortality infection outbreaks in hospitals and healthcare settings. The prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) is one of four chemical entities， but its clinical use as an antifungal drug has been limited owing to pronounced resistance. However， antifungal combination therapy with 5FC appears as a promising strategy for treatingC. aurisinfections. Here， we show that aC. aurisclinical isolate can rapidly acquire genetic mutations to mount 5FC resistance after only one to two passages under drug selection. We exploit a new bioinformatics workflow to identify genetic polymorphisms from RNA-seq data. Strikingly， we identify several mutations in theFUR1gene encoding the 5-fluorouracil convertase that normally generates the active drug. A single nonsense mutation truncates the enzyme at residue Q30*， leading to 5FC resistance due to inactive Fur1. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that an indel mutation inFCY2also contributes to 5FC resistance. Furthermore， at least one out of seven adapted strains acquired enhanced 5FC tolerance without mutations in the 5FC conversion pathway. Thus， we demonstrate thatFUR1mutations are critical drivers of 5FC resistance inC. auris.IMPORTANCECandida aurisis a high-priority human fungal pathogen， causing infection outbreaks of high mortality in healthcare settings. Antifungal combination therapy with 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) is one of the emerging approaches in treatment. However， acquired 5FC resistance traits have been a matter of concern. 5FC is taken up by fungal cells via a cytosine permease and further metabolized by a cytosine deaminase to 5-fluorouracil (5FU). 5FU is then converted by the Fur1 uracil phosphoribosyltransferase into a toxic antimetabolite that disrupts fungal RNA and DNA syntheses. Mutations in these proteins are commonly associated with 5FC resistance in fungal species. Here， we show thatC. auriscan rapidly develop resistance under 5FC selective stress owing to mutational inactivation of Fur1 function. Moreover， other mechanisms that bypass mutations in the 5FC conversion pathway may also contribute to 5FC resistance traits. Finally， we have developed a tailored bioinformatics workflow that facilitates the identification of polymorphisms associated with 5FC resistance in clinical isolates.Keywords:5FC; Candida auris; FCY2; FUR1; drug resistance; evolution; flucytosine.
Exosomes derived from human urine-derived stem cells ameliorate IL-1β-induced intervertebral disk degeneration.,BMC Musculoskelet Disord, 2024 Jul 12,38997667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38997667/,Background:Human intervertebral disk degeneration (IVDD) is a sophisticated degenerative pathological process. A key cause of IVDD progression is nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) degeneration， which contributes to excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress in the intervertebral disk. However， the mechanisms underlying IVDD and NPC degeneration remain unclear.Methods:We used interleukin (IL)-1β stimulation to establish an NPC-degenerated IVDD model and investigated whether human urine-derived stem cell (USC) exosomes could prevent IL-1β-induced NPC degeneration using western blotting， quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction， flow cytometry， and transcriptome sequencing techniques.Results:We successfully extracted and identified USCs and exosomes from human urine. IL-1β substantially downregulated NPC viability and induced NPC degeneration while modulating the expression of SOX-9， collagen II， and aggrecan. Exosomes from USCs could rescue IL-1β-induced NPC degeneration and restore the expression levels of SOX-9， collagen II， and aggrecan.Conclusions:USC-derived exosomes can prevent NPCs from degeneration following IL-1β stimulation. This finding can aid the development of a potential treatment strategy for IVDD.Keywords:Apoptosis; Exosomes; Intervertebral disc degeneration.
Phlecarinatones H-N: Abietane-type diterpenoids from Phlegmariurus carinatus with proliferative inhibitory effect on U251 glioblastoma cells.,Phytochemistry, 2025 Apr,39675447,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39675447/,Thirteen abietane-type diterpenoids， including seven previously undescribed compounds and six known analogs， were isolated from the root and aerial parts of Phlegmariurus carinatus. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis (UV， IR， NMR， and HRESIMS) and quantum chemical calculations (calculated ECD or13C NMR). Notably， these compounds exhibited high structural diversity. Compounds 1-8 possessed six distinct fused ring systems. Phlecarinatones I (2) and J (3) were identified as rare 6，7-seco-abietane diterpenoids featuring a five-membered lactone ring B. Compounds (1-12) were evaluated for their anti-proliferative activities in the U251 cell line. In particular， phlecarinatone I (2) exhibited potential inhibitory effects on U251 cell proliferation， with an IC50value of 13.88 ± 1.82 μM. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism， p53 signal pathway was enriched from our RNA-seq data. Further investigations using western blot and immunofluorescence assays confirmed that p53 expression was up-regulated in a concentration-independent manner. Additionally， molecular docking studies suggested 2 likely binds to the MDM2-p53 binding region. Finally， an shRNA-mediated MDM2 knockdown experiment provided definitive evidence that 2 acts as a potent inhibitor of glioma proliferation， operating via the modulation of the MDM2-p53 pathway. These findings suggest that 2 might be a valuable of lead compound with anti-proliferative activity.Keywords:Abietane diterpenoids; Anti-proliferative activities; Huperziaceae; Molecular docking; Phlegmariurus carinatus.
Hyperoside induces ferroptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia cells by targeting NRF2.,Mol Med, 2024 Nov 21,39573995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39573995/,Background:Hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside) is a flavonol glycoside compound derived from plants in the Hypericum and Crataegus genera that reportedly exhibits an array of anti-inflammatory， antioxidant， and antitumor properties such that it has been used to treat various diseases. Whether it can serve as an effective treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells， however， has yet to be established. The present study was thus devised to assess the therapeutic effects of hyperoside on CML cells and to clarify the underlying mechanism of action.Methods:Cellular viability， proliferative activity， migration， and apoptotic death were respectively analyzed through CCK-8， EDU， transwell， and flow cytometry assays. RNA-seq and bioinformatics approaches were further employed to evaluate the mechanisms through which hyperoside influences CML cells， while analyses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free iron were detected with commercial kits. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial morphology. Molecular docking， cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)， and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) approaches were also used to explore the ability of hyperoside to target NRF2.Results:From a mechanistic perspective， hyperoside was able to inhibit SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling in a manner that was abrogated by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. NRF2 was also closely associated with the inactivation of the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis mediated by hyperoside such that overexpressing NRF2 ablated the benefits associated with hyperoside treatment.Conclusions:The present analyses indicate that hyperoside can target the NRF2/SLC7A11/GPX4 axis to induce ferroptotic CML cell death.Keywords:Chronic myeloid leukemia; Ferroptosis; Hyperoside; NRF2.

However， the predictive value and therapeutic significance of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLs) in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (EEA) remains unknown.Methods:We obtained RNA-seq data from TCGA database and searched the Literature to identify cuproptosis-related genes. Using machine learning models， we identified prognostic lncRNAs for cuproptosis. Immune properties and drug sensitivity were investigated based on these signatures. Further， a ceRNA network was constructed by bioinformatics andin vitroexperiments were performed.Results:We determined two cuproptosis-related signatures to build the prognostic model in EEA. Afterward， the risk scores of two cuproptosis-related signatures were associated with clinicopathological molecular typing and as independent prognostic factors for EEA. In addition， we observed significant differences in immune function， checkpoints， and CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration between the two risk groups. Furthermore， chemotherapy drugs such as AKT inhibitors exhibited lower IC50 values in the high-risk group. We speculate that ACOXL-AS1 can be served as an endogenous 'sponge' to regulate the expression of MTF1 by miR-421. Throughin vitroexperiments， we preliminarily validated the ceRNA network relationship in the cellular model.Conclusion:In EEAs， this study proposed a broad molecular signature of CRLs are promising biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses.Keywords:EEA; cuproptosis; lncRNA.
Mixed Spices at Culinary Doses Have Prebiotic Effects in Healthy Adults: A Pilot Study.,Nutrients, 2019 Jun 25,31242596,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31242596/,Spices were used as food preservatives prior to the advent of refrigeration， suggesting the possibility of effects on microbiota. Previous studies have shown prebiotic activities in animals and in vitro， but there has not been a demonstration of prebiotic or postbiotic effects at culinary doses in humans. In this randomized placebo-controlled study， we determined in twenty-nine healthy adults the effects on the gut microbiota of the consumption daily of capsules containing 5 g of mixed spices at culinary doses by comparison to a matched control group consuming a maltodextrin placebo capsule. The 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing data were used for microbial characterization. Spice consumption resulted in a significant reduction in Firmicutes abundance (p< 0.033) and a trend of enrichment in Bacteroidetes (p< 0.097) compared to placebo group. Twenty-six operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were different between the spice and placebo groups after intervention. Furthermore， there was a significant negative correlation between fecal short-chain fatty acid propionate concentration and Firmicutes abundance in spice intervention group (p< 0.04). The production of individual fecal short-chain fatty acid was not significantly changed by spice consumption in this study. Mixed spices consumption significantly modified gut microbiota， suggesting a prebiotic effect of spice consumption at culinary doses.Keywords:dietary intervention; firmicutes; gut microbiota; prebiotic effect; short-chain fatty acids; spices.
An efficient simplified method for the generation of corneal epithelial cells from human pluripotent stem cells.,Hum Cell, 2022 Jul,35553384,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35553384/,Corneal epithelial cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an important cell source for preclinical models to test ophthalmic drugs. However， current differentiation protocols lack instructions regarding optimal culturing conditions， which hinders the quality of cells and limits scale-up. Here， we introduce a simplified small molecule-based corneal induction method (SSM-CI) to generate corneal epithelial cells from hPSCs. SSM-CI provides the advantage of minimizing cell-culturing time using two defined culturing media containing TGF-β， and Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors， and bFGF growth factor over 25 days. Compared to the conventional human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE-T) and human primary corneal epithelial cells (hPCEpCs)， corneal epithelial cells generated by SSM-CI are well differentiated and express relevant maturation markers， including PAX6 and CK12. RNA-seq analysis indicated the faithful differentiation of hPSCs into corneal epithelia， with significant upregulation of corneal progenitor and adult corneal epithelial phenotypes. Furthermore， despite the initial inhibition of TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin， upregulation of these pathway-related transcripts was observed in the later stages， indicating their necessity in the generation of mature corneal epithelial cells. Moreover， we observed a shift in gene signatures associated with the metabolic characteristics of mature corneal epithelial cells， involving a decrease in glycolysis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation. This was also attributed to the overexpression of metabolic enzymes and transporter-related transcripts responsible for fatty acid metabolism. Thus， SSM-CI provides a comprehensive method for the generation of functional corneal epithelial cells for use in preclinical models.Keywords:Corneal epithelial cells; Human pluripotent stem cells; Simplified small molecule-based corneal induction method.
HSP90AA1 is an unfavorable prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma and contributes to tumorigenesis and chemotherapy resistance.,Transl Oncol, 2024 Dec,39388959,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39388959/,Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still one of the leading causes of tumor-related deaths. Accumulating evidence indicates that immunogenic cell death (ICD) could occur in tumor cells. However， ICD-related studies are limited in HCC. This study collected HCC RNA sequencing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas， International Cancer Genome Consortium， and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. R software was used to analyze the expression of ICD in HCC and to screen essential genes with prognostic value. qRT-PCR and WB determined the mRNA and protein expressions of hub gene. Cell viability assay， Clonal formation assay， and Live/dead staining assay were employed to determine the gene functions. After cross-analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and ICD-related genes (ICDRGs)， 7 differentially expressed ICDRGs were identified in HCC. Of them， HSP90AA1， with the most excellent prognostic value in HCC， was selected， whose expression was also validated in public cohorts， cell lines， and clinical tissue samples. High HSP90AA1 expression indicated an inferior prognosis of HCC， and HSP90AA1 knockdown significantly suppressed cell viability and chemotherapy resistance of HCC. ICD-related gene HSP90AA1 was an unfavorable factor for HCC， and high HSP90AA1 expression contributed to tumor cell survival and chemotherapy resistance.Keywords:Chemotherapy resistance; HSP90AA1; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Immunogenic cell death; Prognosis.
CT2-3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes through regulating PI3K/AKT pathway.,Eur J Pharmacol, 2023 Oct 5,37406849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37406849/,Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of chronic autoimmune disease. The existing therapies encountered several challenges. Therefore， continued novel anti-RA drug discovery remains necessary for RA therapy. Recently， our group reported a novel compound named CT2-3， which could be realized as a hybrid of the natural product magnolol and phthalimide and exhibited anti-lung cancer activity. However， the effect of CT2-3 on RA is unclear. Here， we aim to explore the effect and potential mechanism of CT2-3 on the abnormal functions of RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). In this study， we identified the important role of the dysregulated cell cycle and apoptosis of RA-FLSs in RA progression. Interestingly， we found that CT2-3 inhibited the proliferation and DNA replication of primary RA-FLSs and immortalized RA-FLSs namely MH7A. In addition， CT2-3 downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)， cyclin A2， and cyclin B1， resulting in cell cycle arrest of primary RA-FLSs and MH7A cells. Also， CT2-3 downregulated the level of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)， and increased the level of Bcl-2 associated X (Bax)， contributing to apoptosis of primary RA-FLSs and MH7A cells. Furthermore， differential analyses of RNA-sequencing， Western blot， and network pharmacological analysis confirmed that CT2-3 inhibited phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway of primary RA-FLSs and MH7A cells. In conclusion， CT2-3 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in RA-FLSs through modulating PI3K/AKT pathway， which may serve as a potential lead compound for further novel small molecule anti-RA drug development.Keywords:Apoptosis; CT2-3; Cell cycle arrest; Fibroblast-like synoviocytes; Rheumatoid arthritis.
Identification of functional circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network for exploring prospective therapy strategy of colorectal cancer.,J Cell Biochem, 2020 Dec,32115780,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32115780/,Circular RNA (circRNA) has been reported to have great scientific significance and clinical value in multiple cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). However， the biological function of most circRNAs in CRC is still in its infancy. Herein， we discovered the differential expressed circRNAs (DECs) between CRC tissues and matched adjacent using deep RNA sequencing and further confirmed the DECs expression by combining with another Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Furthermore， we validated the expression of the top four upregulated circRNAs (hsa_circ_0030632， hsa_circ_0004887， hsa_circ_0001550， and hsa_circ_0001681) in both of paired CRC tissues and CRC cell lines. Then， a circRNA/microRNA/messenger RNA regulatory network was established and the Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed these four circRNAs participated in various biological processed including apoptotic process and multiple metabolic processes. Moreover， based on the regulatory network， three bioactive compounds (pergolide， pivampicillin， and methylergometrine) for the treatment of CRC were also found. In conclusion， this study improved our understanding of circRNAs and may also facilitate the finding of promising targets and biomarkers in CRC.Keywords:RNA deep sequencing; bioactive compound; circular RNA; colorectal cancer; functional prediction; regulatory network.
Efficacy of the MEK Inhibitor Cobimetinib and its Potential Application to Colorectal Cancer Cells.,Cell Physiol Biochem, 2018,29794421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29794421/,Background/aims:Mutations in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway are detected in 50% of colorectal cancer cases and play a crucial role in cancer development and progression. Cobimetinib is a MEK inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma and inhibits the cell viability of other types of cancer cells.Methods:HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were treated with cobimetinib， and MTT assay， colony formation assay， and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cell viability， cell cycle， and apoptosis， respectively. The expression of genes associated with the cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. To explore use of cobimetinib in colorectal cancer treatment and further understand its mechanisms， RNA-seq technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cobimetinib-treated and untreated HCT116 cells. Furthermore， we compared these DEGs with Gene Expression Omnibus data from colorectal cancer tissues and normal colonic epithelial tissues.Results:We found that cobimetinib not only inhibited cell proliferation but also induced G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells， suggesting that cobimetinib may useful in colorectal cancer therapy. After cobimetinib treatment， 3，495 DEGs were obtained， including 2，089 upregulated genes and 1，406 downregulated genes， and most of these DEGs were enriched in the cell cycle， DNA replication， and DNA damage repair pathways. Our results revealed that some genes with high expression in colorectal cancer tissues were downregulated by cobimetinib in HCT116 cells， including CCND1， E2F1， CDC25C， CCNE2， MYC， and PCNA. These genes have vital roles in DNA replication and the cell cycle. Furthermore， genes with low expression in colorectal cancer tissues were upregulated by cobimetinib， including PRKCA， PI3K， RTK， and PKC. Based on our results， the PKC and PI3K pathways were activated after cobimetinib treatment， and inhibition of these two pathways can increase the cytotoxicity of cobimetinib in HCT116 cells. Notably， cobimetinib appeared to enhance the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by decreasing TYMS expression， high expression of which is responsible for 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer.Conclusions:Our results suggest the potential use of cobimetinib in colorectal cancer therapy.Keywords:Cancer therapy; Cobimetinib; Colorectal Cancer; Thymidylate synthetase.
Prolonged treatment with Y-27632 promotes the senescence of primary human dermal fibroblasts by increasing the expression of IGFBP-5 and transforming them into a CAF-like phenotype.,Aging (Albany NY), 2020 Aug 25,32843583,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843583/,The Rho-kinases (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 has been shown to promote the growth of epidermal cells， however， its potential effects on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) need to be clarified. Here we show that prolonged treatment of HDFs with Y-27632 decreased their growth by inducing senescence， which was associated with induction of the senescence markers p16 and p21， and downmodulation of the ERK pathways. The senescent HDFs induced by Y-27632 acquired a cancer-associated-fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype to promote squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell growthin vitro. Expression of a newly identified target of Y-27632 by RNA-seq， insulin growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5)， was dramatically increased after 24 h of treatment with Y-27632. Adding recombinant IGFBP-5 protein to the culture medium produced similar phenotypes of HDFs as did treatment with Y-27632， and knockdown of IGFBP-5 blocked the Y-27632-induced senescence. Furthermore， Y-27632 induced the expression of an IGFBP-5 upstream gene， GATA4， and knockdown of GATA4 also reduced the Y-27632-induced senescence. In summary， these results demonstrate for the first time that Y-27632 promotes cellular senescence in primary HDFs by inducing the expression of IGFBP-5 and that prolonged treatment with Y-27632 potentially transforms primary HDFs into CAF-like cells.Keywords:IGFBP-5; Rho kinase inhibitor; Y-27632; dermal fibroblast; senescence.
Analyzes In Silico Indicate the lncRNAs MIR31HG and LINC00939 as Possible Epigenetic Inhibitors of the Osteogenic Differentiation in PDLCs.,Genes (Basel), 2023 Aug 18,37628700,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37628700/,Chromatin conformation， DNA methylation pattern， transcriptional profile， and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) interactions constitute an epigenetic pattern that influences the cellular phenotypic commitment and impacts the clinical outcomes in regenerative therapies. Here， we investigated the epigenetic landscape of the SP7 transcriptor factor (SP7) and Distal-Less Homeobox 4 (DLX4) osteoblastic transcription factors (TFs)， in human periodontal ligament mesenchymal cells (PDLCs) with low (l-PDLCs) and high (h-PDLCs) osteogenic potential. Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq)， genome DNA methylation (Methylome)， and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assays were performed in l- and h-PDLCs， cultured at 10 days in non-induced (DMEM) and osteogenic (OM) medium in vitro. Data were processed inHOMER，Genome Studio，andedgeRprograms， and metadata was analyzed by online bioinformatics tools and inRandPythonenvironments. ATAC-seq analyses showed the TFs genomic regions are more accessible in l-PDLCs than in h-PDLCs. In Methylome analyses， the TFs presented similar average methylation intensities (AMIs)， without differently methylated probes (DMPs) between l- and h-PDLCs; in addition， there were no differences in the expression profiles of TFs signaling pathways. Interestingly， we identified the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)，MIR31HGandLINC00939，as upregulated in l-PDLCs， in both DMEM and OM. In the following analysis， the web-based prediction toolLncRRIsearchpredicted RNA:RNA base-pairing interactions betweenSP7，DLX4，MIR31HG，andLINC00939transcripts. The machine learning programTriplexFPPpredicted DNA:RNA triplex-forming potential for theSP7DNA site and for one of the LINC00939 transcripts (ENST00000502479). PCR data confirmed the upregulation ofMIR31HGandLINC00939transcripts in l-PDLCs (× h-PDLCs) in both DMEM and OM (p< 0.05); conversely，SP7andDLX4were downregulated， confirming those results observed in the RNA-Seq analysis. Together， these results indicate the lncRNAs MIR31HG and LINC00939 as possible epigenetic inhibitors of the osteogenic differentiation in PDLCs by (post)transcriptional and translational repression of theSP7andDLX4TFs.Keywords:DLX4; LINC00939; MIR31HG; PDLC; SP7; epigenetic; osteogenic.
SMYD1 modulates the proliferation of multipotent cardiac progenitor cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells during myocardial differentiation through GSK3β/β-catenin&ERK signaling.,Stem Cell Res Ther, 2024 Oct 8,39380045,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39380045/,Background:The histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SMYD1， which is specific to striated muscle， plays a crucial role in regulating early heart development. Its deficiency has been linked to the occurrence of congenital heart disease. Nevertheless， the precise mechanism by which SMYD1 deficiency contributes to congenital heart disease remains unclear.Methods:We established a SMYD1 knockout pluripotent stem cell line and a doxycycline-inducible SMYD1 expression pluripotent stem cell line to investigate the functions of SMYD1 utilizing an in vitro-directed myocardial differentiation model.Results:Cardiomyocytes lacking SMYD1 displayed drastically diminished differentiation efficiency， concomitant with heightened proliferation capacity of cardiac progenitor cells during the early cardiac differentiation stage. These cellular phenotypes were confirmed through experiments inducing the re-expression of SMYD1. Transcriptome sequencing and small molecule inhibitor intervention suggested that the GSK3β/β-catenin&ERK signaling pathway was involved in the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SMYD1 acted as a transcriptional activator of GSK3β through histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation. Additionally， dual-luciferase analyses indicated that SMYD1 could interact with the promoter region of GSK3β， thereby augmenting its transcriptional activity. Moreover， administering insulin and Insulin-like growth factor 1 can enhance the efficacy of myocardial differentiation in SMYD1 knockout cells.Conclusions:Our research indicated that the participation of SMYD1 in the GSK3β/β-catenin&ERK signaling cascade modulated the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells during myocardial differentiation. This process was partly reliant on the transcription of GSK3β. Our research provided a novel insight into the genetic modification effect of SMYD1 during early myocardial differentiation. The findings were essential to the molecular mechanism and potential interventions for congenital heart disease.Keywords:GSK3β; Histone modification; Human pluripotent stem cells; Myocardial differentiation; SMYD1.
Induction of prolonged early G1 arrest by CDK4/CDK6 inhibition reprograms lymphoma cells for durable PI3Kδ inhibition through PIK3IP1.,Cell Cycle, 2013 Jun 15,23676220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23676220/,Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is constitutive in most human cancers. Selective inhibition of PI3Kδ (p110δ) by GS-1101 has emerged as a promising therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent lymphomas. In aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)， however， efficacy has been observed， but the extent and duration of tumor control is modest. To determine if tumor killing by GS-1101 is cell cycle-dependent， we show in primary MCL cells by whole-transcriptome sequencing that， despite aberrant expression and recurrent mutations in Cyclin D1， mutations are rare in coding regions of CDK4， RB1 and other genes that control G1-S cell cycle progression or PI3K/AKT signaling. PI3Kδ is the predominant PI3K catalytic subunit expressed， and inhibition by GS-1101 transiently inhibits AKT phosphorylation but not proliferation in MCL cells. Induction of prolonged early G1-arrest (pG1) by selective inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with PD 0332991 amplifies and sustains PI3Kδ inhibition， which leads to robust apoptosis. Accordingly， inhibition of PI3Kδ induces apoptosis of primary MCL tumor cells once they have ceased to cycle ex vivo， and this killing is enhanced by PD 0332991 inhibition of CDK4/CDK6. PIK3IP1， a negative PI3K regulator， appears to mediate pG1 sensitization to PI3K inhibition; it is markedly reduced in MCL tumor cells compared with normal peripheral B cells， profoundly induced in pG1 and required for pG1 sensitization to GS-1101. Thus， the magnitude and duration of PI3K inhibition and tumor killing by GS-1101 is pG1-dependent， suggesting induction of pG1 by CDK4/CDK6 inhibition as a strategy to sensitize proliferating lymphoma cells to PI3K inhibition.Keywords:CDK4; CDK6; GS-1101; PD 0332991; PI3Kα PIK3IP1; PI3Kδ; mantle cell lymphoma.

The novel miR-9501 inhibits cell proliferation， migration and activates apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer.,Med Oncol, 2016 Nov,27734264,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27734264/,umulating evidences suggest that lots of microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in (patho-)physiological processes of lung cancer， including metastasis， drug-resistance or tumorigenesis. They mediate the progression of cell growth， migration and invasion by regulating the expression of special genes. MiRNA expression patterns could also serve as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. Cancer therapies mediated by miRNAs remain tremendous potential and challenges. Our previous small RNA-seq assay found that the novel miR-9501 was down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. In this study， our results verified that miR-9501 was significantly down-regulated in lung cancer tissues and its expression levels were remarkably suppressed in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Then， we characterized and investigated the novel miR-9501 in A549 cells. Transient transfection of miR-9501 into cultured A549 cells led to remarkable decrease in cell proliferation， migration and increase apoptosis. These data demonstrated that miR-9501 might be a tumor suppressor for lung cancer therapy.Keywords:Hsa-miRNA-9501 (miR-9501); Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Proliferation.
PLK1 Regulates MicroRNA Biogenesis through Drosha Phosphorylation.,Int J Mol Sci, 2023 Sep 19,37762595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37762595/,"Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1)， a key mediator of cell-cycle progression， is associated with poor prognosis and is a therapeutic target in a number of malignancies. Putative phosphorylation sites for PLK1 have been identified on Drosha， the main catalytic component of the microprocessor responsible for miR biogenesis. Several kinases， including GSK3β， p70 S6 kinase， ABL， PAK5， p38 MAPK， CSNK1A1 and ANKRD52-PPP6C， have been shown to phosphorylate components of the miR biogenesis machinery， altering their activity and/or localisation， and therefore the biogenesis of distinct miR subsets. We hypothesised that PLK1 regulates miR biogenesis through Drosha phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assays confirmed PLK1 phosphorylation of Drosha at S300and/or S302. PLK1 inhibition reduced serine-phosphorylated levels of Drosha and its RNA-dependent association with DGCR8. In contrast， a ""phospho-mimic"" Drosha mutant showed increased association with DGCR8. PLK1 phosphorylation of Drosha alters Drosha Microprocessor complex subcellular localisation， since PLK1 inhibition increased cytosolic protein levels of both DGCR8 and Drosha， whilst nuclear levels were decreased. Importantly， the above effects are independent of PLK1's cell cycle-regulatory role， since altered Drosha:DGCR8 localisation upon PLK1 inhibition occurred prior to significant accumulation of cells in M-phase， and PLK1-regulated miRs were not increased in M-phase-arrested cells. Small RNA sequencing and qPCR validation were used to assess downstream consequences of PLK1 activity on miR biogenesis， identifying a set of ten miRs (miR-1248， miR-1306-5p， miR-2277-5p， miR-29c-5p， miR-93-3p， miR-152-3p， miR-509-3-5p， miR-511-5p， miR-891a-5p and miR-892a) whose expression levels were statistically significantly downregulated by two pharmacological PLK1 kinase domain inhibitors， RO-5203280 and GSK461364. Opposingly， increased levels of these miRs were observed upon transfection of wild-type or constitutively active PLK1. Importantly， pre-miR levels were reduced upon PLK1 inhibition， and pri-miR levels decreased upon PLK1 activation， and hence， PLK1 Drosha phosphorylation regulates MiR biogenesis at the level of pri-miR-to-pre-miR processing. In combination with prior studies， this work identifies Drosha S300and S302as major integration points for signalling by several kinases， whose relative activities will determine the relative biogenesis efficiency of different miR subsets. Identified kinase-regulated miRs have potential for use as kinase inhibitor response-predictive biomarkers， in cancer and other diseases.Keywords:Drosha; PLK1; kinase; microRNA; microRNA biogenesis; non-coding RNA; phosphorylation."
The activation of OR51E1 causes growth suppression of human prostate cancer cells.,Oncotarget, 2016 Jul 26,27374083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27374083/,The development of prostate cancer (PCa) is regulated by the androgen-dependent activity of the androgen receptor (AR). Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is therefore the gold standard treatment to suppress malignant progression of PCa. Nevertheless， due to the development of castration resistance， recurrence of disease after initial response to ADT is a major obstacle to successful treatment. As G-protein coupled receptors play a fundamental role in PCa physiology， they might represent promising alternative or combinatorial targets for advanced diseases. Here， we verified gene expression of the olfactory receptors (ORs) OR51E1 [prostate-specific G-protein coupled receptor 2 (PSGR2)] and OR51E2 (PSGR) in human PCa tissue by RNA-Seq analysis and RT-PCR and elucidated the subcellular localization of both receptor proteins in human prostate tissue. The OR51E1 agonist nonanoic acid (NA) leads to the phosphorylation of various protein kinases and growth suppression of the PCa cell line LNCaP. Furthermore， treatment with NA causes reduction of androgen-mediated AR target gene expression. Interestingly， NA induces cellular senescence， which coincides with reduced E2F1 mRNA levels. In contrast， treatment with the structurally related compound 1-nonanol or the OR2AG1 agonist amyl butyrate， neither of which activates OR51E1， did not lead to reduced cell growth or an induction of cellular senescence. However， decanoic acid， another OR51E1 agonist， also induces cellular senescence. Thus， our results suggest the involvement of OR51E1 in growth processes of PCa cells and its impact on AR-mediated signaling. These findings provide novel evidences to support the functional importance of ORs in PCa pathogenesis.Keywords:OR51E1; androgen receptor; cellular senescence; proliferation; prostate cancer.

TGFBR2‑dependent alterations of microRNA profiles in extracellular vesicles and parental colorectal cancer cells.,Int J Oncol, 2019 Oct,31432155,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31432155/,In colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI)， >90% of cases are affected by inactivating frameshift mutations of transforming growth factor β receptor type 2 (TGFBR2). TGFBR2 deficiency is considered to drive MSI tumor progression by abrogating downstream TGF‑β signaling. This pathway can alter the expression of coding and non‑coding RNAs， including microRNAs (miRNAs)， which are also present in extracellular vesicles (EVs) as post‑transcriptional modulators of gene expression. In our previous study， it was shown that TGFBR2 deficiency alters the protein composition and function of EVs in MSI tumors. To investigate whether mutant TGFBR2 may also affect the miRNA cargo of EVs， the present study characterized miRNAs in EVs and their parental MSI tumor cells that differed only in TGFBR2 expression status. The HCT116‑TGFBR2 MSI cell line model enables the doxycycline (dox)‑inducible reconstituted expression of TGFBR2 in an isogenic background (‑dox， TGFBR2 deficient; +dox， TGFBR2 proficient). Small RNA sequencing of cellular and EV miRNAs showed that the majority of the miRNAs (263/471; 56%) were shared between MSI tumor cells and their EVs. Exploratory data analysis revealed the TGBFR2‑dependent cluster separation of miRNA profiles in EVs and MSI tumor cells. This segregation appeared to result from two subsets of miRNAs， the expression of which were regulated in a TGFBR2‑dependent manner (EVs: n=10; MSI cells: n=15). In the EV subset， 7/10 miRNAs were downregulated and 3/10 were upregulated by TGFBR2 deficiency. In the cellular subset， 13/15 miRNAs were downregulated and 2/15 miRNAs were upregulated in the TGFBR2‑deficient cells. The present study emphasizes the general overlap of miRNA profiles in MSI tumor cells and their EVs， but also highlights the impact of a single tumor driver mutation on the expression of individual miRNAs， as exemplified by the downregulation of miR‑381‑3p in TGFBR2‑deficient MSI tumor cells and their secreted EVs.

Epstein-Barr Virus BRRF1 Induces Butyrophilin 2A1 in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma NPC43 Cells via the IL-22/JAK3-STAT3 Pathway.,Int J Mol Sci, 2024 Dec 15,39769218,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39769218/,Epstein-Barr virus is highly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with genes expressed for tumor transformation or maintenance of viral latency， but there are certain genes that can modulate immune molecules. Butyrophilin 2A1 (BTN2A1) is an important activating protein for presenting phosphoantigens for recognition by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to achieve antitumor activities. We have previously shown that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells achieve efficacy against NPC when BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 are upregulated by stimulating EBV gene expression， particularly LMP1. While BTN3A1 can be induced by the LMP1-mediated IFN-γ/JNK/NLRC5 pathway， the viral gene that can regulate BTN2A1 remains elusive. We showed that BTN2A1 expression is directly mediated by EBV BRRF1， which can trigger the BTN2A1 promoter and downstream JAK3-STAT3 pathway in NPC43 cells， as shown by RNA-seq data and verified via inhibitor experiments. Furthermore， BRRF1 downregulated IL-22 binding protein (IL-22RA2) to complement the EBNA1-targeting probe (P4)-induced IL-22 expression. Therefore， this study elucidated a new mechanism of stimulating BTN2A1 expression in NPC cells via the EBV gene BRRF1. The JAK3-STAT3 pathway could act in concordance with IL-22 to enhance the expression of BTN2A1， which likely leads to increased tumor cell killing by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells for enhanced potential as immunotherapy against the cancer.Keywords:BRRF1; Epstein–Barr virus; IL-22; butyrophilin; gamma-delta T cells; nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Modelling cadmium-induced cardiotoxicity using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.,J Cell Mol Med, 2018 Sep,29993192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29993192/,Cadmium， a highly ubiquitous toxic heavy metal， has been widely recognized as an environmental and industrial pollutant， which confers serious threats to human health. The molecular mechanisms of the cadmium-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC) have not been studied in human cardiomyocytes at the cellular level. Here we showed that human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) can recapitulate the CIC at the cellular level. The cadmium-treated hPSC-CMs exhibited cellular phenotype including reduced cell viability， increased apoptosis， cardiac sarcomeric disorganization， elevated reactive oxygen species， altered action potential profile and cardiac arrhythmias. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a differential transcriptome profile and activated MAPK signalling pathway in cadmium-treated hPSC-CMs， and suppression of P38 MAPK but not ERK MAPK or JNK MAPK rescued CIC phenotype. We further identified that suppression of PI3K/Akt signalling pathway is sufficient to reverse the CIC phenotype， which may play an important role in CIC. Taken together， our data indicate that hPSC-CMs can serve as a suitable model for the exploration of molecular mechanisms underlying CIC and for the discovery of CIC cardioprotective drugs.Keywords:MAPK; PI3K/Akt; apoptosis; cadmium-induced cardiotoxicity; electrophysiology; hPSC-CMs.

Role of miR-214 in regulation of β-catenin and the malignant phenotype of melanoma.,Mol Carcinog, 2019 Nov,31338875,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31338875/,Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in melanocyte biology， especially in the early stages of melanocyte transformation and melanomagenesis. β-catenin， encoded by the gene CTNNB1， is an intracellular signal transducer of Wnt signaling and activates transcription of genes important for cell proliferation and survival. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is frequently activated in melanoma through oncogenic mutations of β-catenin and elevated β-catenin levels are positively correlated with melanoma aggressiveness. Molecular mechanisms that regulate β-catenin expression in melanoma are not fully understood. MicroRNA-214 is known to function as a tumor suppressor by targeting β-catenin in several types of cancer cells. Here， we investigated the regulation of β-catenin by miR-214 and its role in melanoma. We show that β-catenin mRNA levels are negatively correlated with miR-214 in melanoma. However， overexpression of miR-214 paradoxically increased β-catenin protein levels and promoted malignant properties of melanoma cells including resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (MAPKi). RNA-seq analysis revealed that melanoma cells predominantly express a β-catenin mRNA isoform lacking miR-214 target site. Using matched miRNA and mRNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis， we identified novel miR-214 targets， ankyrin repeat domain 6 (ANKRD6) and C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1)， that are involved in negative regulation of Wnt signaling. Overexpression of miR-214 or knockdown of the novel miR-214 targets， ANKRD6 or CTBP1， increased melanoma cell proliferation， migration， and decreased sensitivity to MAPKi. Our data suggest that in melanoma cells β-catenin is not regulated by miR-214 and the functions of miR-214 in melanoma are mediated partly by regulating proteins involved in attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Keywords:CTNNB1; Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; chemoresistance; metastatic melanoma; microRNA-214; tumor growth.
Knockdown of BATF3 Inhibits Gastric Cancer Cell Growth and Radioresistance via S1PR1/STAT3 Pathway.,Ann Clin Lab Sci, 2022 Sep,36261191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36261191/,Objective:Gastric cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. Basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 3 (BATF3) plays a key role in tumor immunity. However， the function of BATF3 in gastric cancer remains unclear. Here， we demonstrated BATF3 positively regulated proliferation and radioresistance of gastric cancer cells by regulating S1PR1/STAT3 pathway.Methods:The RNA-seq analyzed the gene expression by UALCAN web portal and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource. RT-qPCR and western blot was performed to verify BATF3 expression in gastric cancer cells. The assays of CCK-8， EdU incorporation and colony formation were used to analyze cell proliferation， and radioresistance in AGS and MKN45 cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell apoptosis of AGS and MKN45 in treatment with si-BATF3 or radiation. Finally， western blot was performed to measure the expression of cell apoptosis-related modules including Bax， cleaved-caspase3， cleaved-PARP and assess the regulation of S1PR1/STAT3 pathway.Results:BATF3 expression was upregulated in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of BATF3 suppressed proliferation， radioresistance but promoted the radiation-induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through positively regulating S1PR1 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation.Conclusions:Knockdown of BATF3 inhibits gastric cancer cell growth and radioresistance via S1PR1/STAT3 pathway. BATF3 would become a potential diagnostic indicator for gastric cancer and target of therapeutic treatment.Keywords:BATF3; S1PR1; STAT3; cancer cell growth; gastric cancer; radioresistance.
FOXM1 affects oxidative stress， mitochondrial function， and the DNA damage response by regulating p21 in aging oocytes.,Theriogenology, 2024 Nov,39163804,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39163804/,Fertilization capacity and embryo survival rate are decreased in postovulatory aging oocytes， which results in a reduced reproductive rate in female animals. However， the key regulatory genes and related regulatory mechanisms involved in the process of postovulatory aging in oocytes remain unclear. In this study， RNA-Seq revealed that 3237 genes were differentially expressed in porcine oocytes between the MII and aging stages (MII + 24 h). The expression level of FOXM1 was increased at the aging stage， and FOXM1 was also observed to be enriched in many key biological processes， such as cell senescence， response to oxidative stress， and transcription， during porcine oocyte aging. Previous studies have shown that FOXM1 is involved in the regulation of various biological processes， such as oxidative stress， DNA damage repair， mitochondrial function， and cellular senescence， which suggests that FOXM1 may play a crucial role in the process of postovulatory aging. Therefore， in this study， we investigated the effects and mechanisms of FOXM1 on oxidative stress， mitochondrial function， DNA damage， and apoptosis during oocyte aging. Our study revealed that aging oocytes exhibited significantly increased ROS levels and significantly decreased GSH， SOD， T-AOC， and CAT levels than did oocytes at the MII stage and that FOXM1 inhibition exacerbated the changes in these levels in aging oocytes. In addition， FOXM1 inhibition increased the levels of DNA damage， apoptosis， and cell senescence in aging oocytes. A p21 inhibitor alleviated the effects of FOXM1 inhibition on oxidative stress， mitochondrial function， and DNA damage and thus alleviated the degree of senescence in aging oocytes. These results indicate that FOXM1 plays a crucial role in porcine oocyte aging. This study contributes to the understanding of the function and mechanism of FOXM1 during porcine oocyte aging and provides a theoretical basis for preventing oocyte aging and optimizing conditions for the in vitro culture of oocytes.Keywords:FOXM1; Pig; Postovulatory aging; p21.
Cornuside I promoted osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.,J Orthop Surg Res, 2021 Jun 21,34154621,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34154621/,Background:Osteoporosis is a common disease closely associated with aging. In this study， we aimed to investigate the role of Cornuside I in promoting osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the potential mechanism.Methods:BMSCs were isolated and treated with different concentrations of Cornuside I (0， 10， 30， 60 μM). Cell proliferation was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. RNA sequencing was performed on the isolated BMSCs with control and Cornuside I treatment. Differentially expressed genes were obtained by the R software. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and Alizarin Red Staining (ARS) were performed to assess the osteogenic capacity of the NEO. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of osteoblast markers.Results:Cornuside I treatment significantly improved BMSC proliferation. The optimal dose of Cornuside I was 30 μM (P < 0.05). Cornuside I dose dependently increased the ALP activity and calcium deposition than control group (P < 0.05). A total of 704 differentially expressed genes were identified between Cornuside I and normal BMSCs. Cornuside I significantly increased the PI3K and Akt expression. Moreover， the promotion effects of Cornuside I on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs were partially blocked by PI3K/Akt inhibitor， LY294002.Conclusion:Cornuside I plays a positive role in promoting osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs， which was related with activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Keywords:Bone mesenchymal stem cells; Cornuside I; PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
Aloe gel glucomannan induced colon cancer cell death via mitochondrial damage-driven PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway.,Carbohydr Polym, 2022 Nov 1,35989033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35989033/,Mitophagy can selectively remove damaged mitochondria， which is critical in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis in diseases， such as cancer. Herein， we found that Aloe gel glucomannan (AGP) significantly inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that AGP upregulated autophagy， lysosome and mitochondrial fission signal pathways in colon cancer cell line CT26. Notably， AGP induced the accumulation of impaired and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating mitochondria， which triggered excessive mitophagy. Interestingly， the mitophagy activator enhanced AGP-induced mitophagy and cytotoxicity， whereas the mitophagy inhibitor reversed the influence of AGP. Furthermore， activation of PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway and transcription factor EB (TFEB) signaling was dependent on ROS overproduction. Taken together， these results indicated that AGP induced cytotoxic mitophagy through ROS-related PINK1/Parkin pathway and TFEB activation in CT26 cells. The research would provide theoretical basis for the development of AGP as a promising anticancer agent.Keywords:Aloe gel glucomannan; Ammonium sulfate (PubChem CID: 6097028); Crystal Violet (PubChem CID: 11057); DAPI (PubChem CID: 2954); Ethanol (PubChem CID: 702); FCCP (PubChem CID: 3330); Hoechst 33342 (PubChem CID: 1464); Mdivi-1 (PubChem CID: 3825829); MitoTracker Red (PubChem CID: 22613925); Mitophagy; N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (PubChem CID: 12035); Phenol (PubChem CID: 996); ROS; Rapamycin (PubChem CID: 5284616); Sulfuric Acid (PubChem CID: 1118); TFEB; Triton X-100 (PubChem CID: 5590); colon cancer.

Increasing evidence revealed a significant association between the A allele of rs2274911 and male diseases， such as oligospermia， cryptorchidism， and prostate tumor. However， the function of rs2274911 in healthy males is unclear.Subjects and methods:A total of 1742 healthy men were selected from the Fangchenggang Area Male Health and Examination Survey (FAMHES). The association between rs2274911 and phenotype was evaluated. The cell characteristics of rs2274911 mutation (mu)， wild-type GPRC6A (WT)， and RFP control in human embryonic kidney (293T) and human prostate cancer (PC3) cells were analyzed. RNA sequencing was performed on PC3 cells.Results:E2 and PSA serum levels increased with the accumulation of the A allele (E2: G vs. A， -0.029 [-0.050， -0.008]， P < 0.01， P trend = 0.027; PSA: G vs. A， -0.040 [-0.079， 0.000]， P < 0.05， P trend = 0.048). rs2274911 enhanced the proliferation and invasion ability of PC3 or 293T cells and activated the ERK pathway. The genes were identified as rs2274911 mu-affected genes through RNA sequential analysis of rs2274911 mu， GPRC6A WT， and RFP control of PC3 cells.
