RNA-seq from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale,GSE39619,Mus musculus,This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data， contact the submitting laboratory directly (Philip Caytingmailto:pcayting@stanford.edu). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data， contact ENCODE (mailto:genome@soe.ucsc.edu).The tracks show enrichment of RNA sequence tags mapped to the mouse genome generated by high throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from enriched RNA that was obtained after depletion of ribosomal RNA. Pieces of cDNA， 300-350 nucleotides in length， were PCR amplified， adapter ligated， and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer.For data usage terms and conditions， please refer tohttp://www.genome.gov/27528022andhttp://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf,Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols (http://hgwdev.cse.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/protocols/cell). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (74104， Aiagen)， following the manufacturer's protocol. Ribosomal RNA was removed from total RNA using the Ribo-ZeroTM Gold Kits (MRZG126， Epicentre). Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was performed on the rRNA depleted RNA using random primers and the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (11917-010， Life Tech). After first strand cDNA synthesis， NucAway Spin Column (Ambion cat. 100070-30) was used to remove dNTPs. In the second strand cDNA synthesis reaction， dTTP in the dNTP mix was substituted with dUTP. After end repair and addition of 'A' base to 3' end， illumina paired-end adapter was ligated to Double-stranded cDNA library. After gel size selection of adapter ligated cDNA (300-350)， Uracil-N-Glycosylase (UNG: Applied Biosystems) was used to digest the second strand cDNA (Parkhomchuk et al. ， 2009). PCR amplified adapter ligated cDNA was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. Sequence reads of 2x101 nt long with 0-2 mismatches were mapped to the mouse genome (version mm9) using the BWA aligner， version 0.5.7. The signal height corresponds to the number of overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome.,nan,
Therapeutic use of microRNA-181a in the adoptive immunotherapy of cancer,GSE9240,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The generation of highly-reactive T lymphocytes against tumor-associated antigens remains an obstacle for effective adoptive immunotherapy of cancer. Recently， we found that microRNA-181a (miR-181a) acts as an intrinsic modulator of T cell antigen sensitivity in a transgenic T cell line in vitro. This molecule is part of a growing family of evolutionarily selected small interfering RNA that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation or translational repression. Here， we explored the use of miR-181a to improve anti-tumor T cell responsiveness against weakly immunogenic tumor-associated antigens. We found that genetic engineering of T lymphocytes with miR-181a dramatically augmented the function of poorly responsive human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and TCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes， resulting in potent anti-tumor reactivity. Furthermore， in a mouse model， miR-181a increased the function of self/tumor-specific CD8+ T cells enabling effective tumor destruction in the absence of vaccination or exogenous cytokines that were otherwise essential requirements and thus represents a significant advance over previous approaches. Although miRNAs have been previously shown to play critical functional roles in the development and function of vertebrate immune systems and pathogenesis of cancer， this report comprises the first use of a miRNA gene as tool in the treatment of disease.Keywords: cellular modification design,For the 6 mouse samples the Operon Array-Ready Oligo Set (AROSâ¢) V 4.0 contains 35，852 longmer probes representing 25，000 genes and about 38，000 gene transcripts and also includes 380 controls platform was used and each sample was hybridized in duplicate.

Total RNA in good quality was used as starting materials and purified twice through MACs polyT column aimed to enrich polyA and remove any contaminants (e.g.， rRNA， tRNA， DNA， protein etc.). A one microgram enriched polyA RNA sample was then fragmented to small pieces， and a gel-based selection method was performed to collect fragmented random polyA at a size-range of 50-150 nt in length. The collected fragmental RNA was then hybridized and ligated to a mix of adapters provided from ABI， followed by reverse transcription to generate corresponding cDNAs. The resulting cDNA library was further amplified by PCR and sequenced by SOLiD platform for single reads at 35 bp length (new version in 50 bp length). Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols. Data: The SOLiD-generated RNA-Seq reads were 35 bp in length. An initial filtering process was performed to remove any non-desirable contamination sequences， such as rRNA， tRNA， and repeats etc. A read-split mapping approach was developed to map the 35 bp reads onto the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) excluding mitochondrion， haplotypes， randoms and chromosome Y. Mapping parameters: Strand specific mapping was done using Applied Biosystems' SOLiD alignment where all the reads were mapped to the genome， and to exon-exon junction database. Seed and extend strategy is adopted where initial seed length of 25 is mapped with maximum of 2 mismatches and then extended to read length， each color space match is awarded a score of +1 and each mismatch is awarded a penalty of -2. After extension each read is trimmed to its maximum score， shortest length. The color space sequences are then converted into base space and checked to ensure that each sequence has a maximum of 2 base pair mismatches. If any sequence has more than 2 mismatches， then that sequence is discarded.,nan,

The Sin3a/HDAC co-repressor complex cooperates with Nanog in promoting stem cell pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming [ChIP-Seq],GSE91021,Mus musculus,Despite the requirement of Sin3a for survival of early embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs)， mechanistic action of Sin3a in the maintenance and establishment of pluripotency remains unexplored. Here we report the transcriptional regulatory roles of Sin3a in maintaining ESC pluripotency and in reprogramming somatic cells towards full pluripotency. Sin3a/HDAC complex members were enriched in an extended Nanog interactome and exhibited a predominant transcriptional co-activator role at a global level in ESCs. We also established a critical role for Sin3a in efficient reprogramming of somatic cells towards full pluripotency. Nanog and Sin3a co-localize at almost all of their genome-wide targets in pre-iPSCs， and both factors are required to directly induce a synergistic transcriptional program wherein pluripotency genes are activated and reprogramming barrier genes are repressed. Our results， for the first time， establish positive roles of the Sin3a/HDAC complex in the maintenance and establishment of pluripotency.,Genome binding/occupancy profiling of Nanog and Sin3a in pre-iPSCs for somatic cell reprogramming,28199843,Cell Rep
Gene expression profiling in Ciona TVCs with FGF-MAPK perturbation [bulk RNA-seq],GSE99845,Ciona robusta,Dynamic gene expression programs determine multipotent cell states and fate choices during development. Multipotent progenitors for cardiomyocytes and branchiomeric head muscles populate the pharyngeal mesoderm of vertebrate embryos， but the mechanisms underlying cardiopharyngeal multipotency and heart vs. head muscle fate choices remain elusive. The tunicate Ciona emerged as a simple chordate model to study cardiopharyngeal development with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We analyzed the transcriptome of single cardiopharyngeal lineage cells isolated at successive time points encompassing the transitions from multipotent progenitors to distinct first and second heart， and pharyngeal muscle precursors. We reconstructed the three cardiopharyngeal developmental trajectories， and characterized gene expression dynamics and regulatory states underlying each fate choice. Experimental perturbations and bulk transcriptome analyses revealed that ongoing FGF/MAPK signaling maintains cardiopharyngeal multipotency and promotes the pharyngeal muscle fate， whereas signal termination permits the deployment of a full pan-cardiac program and heart fate specification. We identified the Dach1/2 homolog as a novel evolutionarily conserved second-heart-field-specific factor and demonstrate， through lineage tracing and CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations，  that it operates downstream of Tbx1/10 to actively suppress the first heart lineage program. This data indicates that the regulatory state of multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors determines the first vs. second heart lineage choice， and that Tbx1/10 acts as a bona fide regulator of cardiopharyngeal multi potency.We performed bulk RNAseq to profile the FACS purified Ciona Robusta Truck Ventral Cells (TVCs) with FGF-MAPK perturbation conditions to address the question- What is the role of FGF signaling pathway during early cardiopharyngeal specification.  we performed bulk RNA sequencing of FACS-purified cardiopharyngeal lineage cells isolated from embryos and larvae expressing either a dominant negative form the fibroblast growth factor receptor (dnFGFR)， or a constitutively active form of M-Ras (caM-Ras)， the sole Ras homolog in Ciona， under the control of TVC-specific enhancers.,Examination of 2 different FGF-MAPK perturbation conditions in TVCs from 4 time points.,nan,
High-Resolution Transcriptome Maps Reveal Strain-Specific Regulatory Features of Multiple Campylobacter jejuni Isolates,GSE38883,Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819;Campylobacter jejuni RM1221;Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81-176;Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81116,Campylobacter jejuni is currently the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. Comparison of multiple Campylobacter strains revealed a high genetic and phenotypic diversity. However， little is known about differences in transcriptome organization， gene expression， and small RNA (sRNA) repertoires. Here we present the first comparative primary transcriptome analysis based on the differential RNAâseq (dRNAâseq) of four C. jejuni isolates. Our approach includes a novel， generic method for the automated annotation of transcriptional start sites (TSS)， which allowed us to provide genome-wide promoter maps in the analyzed strains. These global TSS maps are refined through the integration of a SuperGenome approach that allows for a comparative TSS annotation by mapping RNAâseq data of multiple strains into a common coordinate system derived from a whole-genome alignment. Considering the steadily increasing amount of RNAâseq studies， our automated TSS annotation will not only facilitate transcriptome annotation for a wider range of pro- and eukaryotes but can also be adapted for the analysis among different growth or stress conditions. Our comparative dRNAâseq analysis revealed conservation of most TSS， but also single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) in promoter regions， which lead to strain-specific transcriptional output. Furthermore， we identified strain-specific sRNA repertoires that could contribute to differential gene regulation among strains. In addition， we identified a novel minimal CRISPR-system in Campylobacter of the type-II CRISPR subtype， which relies on the host factor RNase III and a trans-encoded sRNA for maturation of crRNAs. This minimal system of Campylobacter， which seems active in only some strains， employs a unique maturation pathway， since the crRNAs are transcribed from individual promoters in the upstream repeats and thereby minimize the requirements for the maturation machinery. Overall， our study provides new insights into strain-specific transcriptome organization and sRNAs， and reveals genes that could modulate phenotypic variation among strains despite high conservation at the DNA level.,Our dRNA-seq study of multiple C. jejuni strains represents the first comparative analysis of the primary transcriptomes of multiple strains and provides new insights into riboregulation in this bacterial pathogen.,23696746,PLoS Genet
Dynamic profiling of the protein life cycle in response to pathogens (protein),GSE59792,Mus musculus,Protein expression is regulated by production and degradation of mRNAs and proteins， but their specific relationships remain unknown. We combine measurements of protein production and degradation and mRNA dynamics to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in LPS stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely， the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation， accounting for over half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. Thus， the proteome is regulated by transcriptional induction of novel cellular functions and remodeling of preexisting functions through the protein life cycle.,Mouse primary dendritic cells were treated with LPS or mock stimulus and profiled over a 12-hour time course. Cells were grown in M-labeled SILAC media， which was replaced with H-labeled SILAC media at time 0. Aliquots were taken at 0， 0.5， 1， 2， 3， 4， 5， 6， 9， and 12 hours post-stimulation and added to equal volumes of a master mix of unlabeled (L) cells for the purpose of normalization. RNA-Seq was performed at 0， 1， 2， 4， 6， 9， and 12 hours post-stimulation.,25745177,Science
Pairing competitive and topologically distinct regulatory modules enhances patterned gene expression,GSE9665,Caenorhabditis elegans,Biological networks are inherently modular， yet little is known about how modules are assembled to enable coordinated and complex functions. We used RNAi and time-series， whole-genome microarray analyses to systematically perturb and characterize components of a C. elegans lineage-specific transcriptional regulatory network.  These data are supported by select reporter gene analyses and comprehensive yeast-one-hybrid and promoter sequence analyses.  Based on these results we define and characterize two modules composed of muscle- and epidermal-specifying transcription factors that function together within a single cell lineage to robustly specify multiple cell types. The expression of these two modules， although positively regulated by a common factor， is reliably segregated among daughter cells. Our analyses indicate that these modules repress each other， and we propose that this cross-inhibition coupled with their relative time of induction function to enhance the initial asymmetry in their expression patterns， thus leading to the observed invariant gene expression patterns and cell lineage.  The coupling of asynchronous and topologically distinct modules may be a general principle of module assembly that functions to potentiate genetic switches.Keywords: Gene expression response of RNAi knockdowns,To study the function of the C-lineage gene regulatory network we used RNAi to knockdown expression of the 13 TFs expressed early in the C lineage， and then used whole-genome microarrays to assess each perturbation for changes in mRNA abundance. RNAi has several advantages as a method to perturb gene function: it reduces both maternal and zygotic transcripts， thus avoiding maternal rescue effects; for essential genes it allows collection of fully affected progeny; and it enables comparison between perturbations. Measuring transcript levels on microarrays is also advantageous， because it is highly parallel， allowing direct comparisons between genes within each perturbation， and it is comprehensive， thus enabling discovery of regulated genes.  In addition， it allows direct comparison to previous efforts to characterize the pal-1 regulatory network (Baugh et al， 2005a; Baugh et al， 2005b).  To increase sensitivity and specificity， we used mex-3 mutant mothers whose progeny are primarily composed of C-like lineages (Draper et al， 1996).  In each case， RNA was collected from embryos two and three cell cycles after the initial zygotic expression of the targeted TF mRNA (Figure 1). We note that our sampling of only two time points might underestimate the magnitude of the observed effect of RNAi on mRNA levels， particularly if the expression level of the assayed mRNA peaks before or after the selected time points. The paralogous tbx-8 and tbx-9 genes， which were previously demonstrated to be functionally redundant (Pocock et al， 2004b; Baugh et al， 2005a)， were simultaneously targeted by RNAi in order to assay a more penetrant effect on gene expression.mex-3 (zu155) mutant worms (JJ518) were used in this experiment. RNAi was administered by soaking and RNA was collected from embryos， both as previously described (Baugh 2005; Baugh et al， 2005b). Cohorts of ten embryos were used for each RNA preparation， and half of the RNA was used for linear amplification. The Artus âExpressArt mRNA Amplification Kitâ was used for amplification. The manufacturerâs protocol was modified in round one with a ten-fold increase in concentration of primers A， B， and C and a four-fold decrease in cDNA synthesis reaction volumes. Microarray hybridization onto Affymetrix C. elegans GeneChip， scanning， data reduction and analysis were done as previously described (Baugh et al， 2003). Expression values were normalized using RMA (Bolstad et al， 2003).,18277379,Mol Syst Biol

Differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) for annotation of transcriptional start sites and small RNAs in Helicobacter pylori,GSE67564,Helicobacter pylori 26695,In this study transcriptional start sites (TSS) for H. pylori 26695 were determined,To detect the complement of transcripts expressed from H. pylori， we collected three independent biological replicates (B1 â B3) from 26695 wild type strain grown to mid-exponential (OD 600 ~0.6) phase under microaerophilic conditions at 37Â°C in BHI medium. For all three samples， total RNA was extracted and subjected to differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) library preparation for primary transcriptome analysis as described previously (Sharma et al.， 2010). Specifically， prior to cDNA library construction half of each RNA sample was treated with 5â terminator exonuclease (+TEX samples)， which degrades RNAs containing a 5â-monophosphate (5â-P) and， thus， enriches for primary transcripts containing 5â-triphosphates (5â-PPP). The other half of each sample was left untreated (-TEX samples) and thus contains both primary transcripts (5â-PPP) and processed RNAs (5â-P).,26091613,Methods
Foxd3 binding at enhancers controls developmental timing of gene expression by regulation of histone acetylation [ChIP-seq],GSE58407,Mus musculus,Transcription factor/enhancer interactions determine cell specific gene expression.  Here， we followed enhancers during differentiations of embryonic stem (ESCs) to epiblast like cells (EpiLCs).  There were highly dynamic changes in histone lysine 27 acetylation at enhancer sites throughout the genome. These sites were enriched for a Foxd3 binding motif， a forkhead transcription factor essential in early embryonic development. Surprisingly， Foxd3 occupied largely mutually exclusive sites in the ESCs versus EpiLCs. Foxd3 bound to nucleosome occupied regions， simultaneously evicting the histones while inhibiting full gene expression through the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Knockout of Foxd3 resulted in hyperacetylation and transcriptional upregulation of neighboring genes， many of which were further upregulated at later stages of differentiation. These data show that Foxd3 primes enhancer sites during pregastrulation by removing nucleosomes， yet suppresses neighboring histone hyperacetylation. Such a mechanism may be common to many transcription factors that prepare enhancers for later gene activation during development.,ChIP-seq of H3K4me1， H3K27ac， H3K27me3， p300， H3K4me3， RNA Pol2 and Oct4 in four pluripotent states: embryonic stem cells (ESCs) day 1 ESC differentiation， Epi-like stem cells (EpiLCs)， and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs); ChIP-seq of 3XFlag tagged Foxd3 in ESCs and EpiLCs; ChIP-seq of H3K4me1， H3K27ac， H3K27me3， p300 and H3K4me3 in Foxd3 conditional knockout cells (tamoxifen-inducible) -/+ 36h Tamoxifen treatemnt.ChIP seq of Flag-Foxd3 (third replicate)， ChIP-seq of HDAC1 and Brg1 in WT and Foxd3 KO cells and MNase-ChIP-seq of H3K4me1,26748757,Cell Stem Cell
Multiplex enhancer-reporter assays uncover unsophisticated p53 enhancer logic [CHEQ-seq],GSE76653,Homo sapiens,Analysis of p53 binding sites using multiplex enhancer reporter assays， ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data.Transcription factors establish and maintain the specific transcriptome of a cell by binding to genomic regulatory regions， thereby regulating the transcription of their target genes. Like many transcription factors， the DNA sequence-specific binding preferences of p53 are known. However， it remains largely unclear what distinguishes functional enhancers from other bound genomic regions that have no regulatory activity. In addition， the genome is scattered with seemingly perfect recognition sequences that remain unoccupied. To disentangle the rules of genome-wide p53 binding， we employed two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays， one using barcoded reporters and the other using enhancer self-transcription. We compared the activity of more than one thousand candidate p53 enhancers under loss and gain of p53 conditions and identified several hundred high-confidence p53-responsive enhancers. Strikingly， the large majority (99%) of these target enhancers can be characterized and distinguished from negative sequences by the occurrence of a single p53 binding site. By training a machine learning classifier on these data， and integrating the resulting genome-wide predictions with fifteen publicly available human p53 ChIP-seq data sets， we identified a consensus set of 1148 functional p53 binding sites in the human genome. Unexpectedly， this direct p53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions， while differences between experiments can be largely attributed to indirect non-functional binding. Our data suggest that direct p53 enhancers function in a context-independent manner and do not contain obvious combinatorial complexity of binding sites for multiple transcription factors. They represent a class of unsophisticated cell-autonomous enhancers with a single binding site， distinct from complex developmental enhancers that integrate signals from multiple transcription factors. This suggests that context-dependent regulation of p53 target genes is not encoded in the p53 enhancer， but at different upstream or downstream layers of the cell's gene regulatory network.,CHEQ-seq multiplex enhancer reporter assay to identify and validate p53-responsive enhancers.,27197205,Genome Res
TUT7 Catalyzes the Uridylation of the 3â End for Rapid Degradation of Histone mRNA,GSE85361,Homo sapiens,Using high-throughput sequencing of histone mRNAs and degradation intermediates， we find that knockdown of TUT7 reduces both the uridylation at the 3â end as well as uridylation pattern at the 3â end， and only had a small effect on the uridylation in the stemloop uridylation of the major during histone mRNA degradation. Knockdown of 3â hEXO also altered the uridylation of histone mRNAs， revealing a dynamic equilibrium between 3â hEXO digestion and TUT7 uridylation， suggesting that TUT7 and 3â hExo function together in trimming and uridylating histone mRNAs.,We sequenced 3' ends of histone mRNAs and degradation intermediates before and after inhibition of DNA replication in HeLa cells using the previously described EnD-seq strategy.,27609902,RNA

ChIP-seq analysis of Î²-catenin in mouse embryonic stem cells treated with GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 under serum+LIF standard condition.,GSE43565,Mus musculus,The objective of this study was to identify the direct target genes of Î²-catenin acting downstream of canonical Wnt signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs).Canonical Wnt signaling supports the pluripotency of mouse ESCs but also promotes differentiation of early mammalian cell lineages. To explain these paradoxical observations， we explored the gene regulatory networks at play. Canonical Wnt signaling is intertwined with the pluripotency network comprising Nanog， Oct4， and Sox2 in mouse ESCs. In defined media supporting the derivation and propagation of mouse ESCs， Tcf3 and Î²-catenin interact with Oct4; Tcf3 binds to Sox motif within Oct-Sox composite motifs that are also bound by Oct4-Sox2 complexes. Further， canonical Wnt signaling up-regulates the activity of the Pou5f1 distal enhancer via the Sox motif in mouse ESCs. When viewed in the context of published studies on Tcf3 and Î²-catenin mutants， our findings suggest that Tcf3 counters pluripotency by competition with Sox2 at these sites， and Tcf3 inhibition is blocked by Î²-catenin entry into this complex. Wnt pathway stimulation also triggers Î²-catenin association at regulatory elements with classic Lef/Tcf motifs associated with differentiation programs. The failure to activate these targets in the presence of a MEK/ERK inhibitor essential for mouse ESC culture suggests that MEK/ERK signaling and canonical Wnt signaling combine to promote mouse ESC differentiation.,bCatenin ChIP-seq using anti-FLAG antibody and Streptavidin were otained from embryonic stem cells treated by CHIR99021 for 24 hours.

Shox2/TALE ChIP-Seq,GSE81897,Mus musculus,ChIP-Sequencing on Shox2-HA E12.5 and E13.5 Limb and Palate， as well as Pbx on E12.5 limb .Abstract:Vertebrate appendage patterning is programmed by Hox-TALE factors-bound regulatory elements. However， it remains enigmatic which cell lineages are commissioned by Hox-TALE factors to generate regional specific pattern and whether other Hox-TALE co-factors exist. In this study， we investigated the transcriptional mechanisms controlled by the Shox2 transcriptional regulator in limb patterning. Harnessing an osteogenic lineage-specific Shox2 inactivation approach we show that despite widespread Shox2 expression in multiple cell lineages， lack of the stylopod observed upon Shox2 deficiency is a specific result of Shox2 loss of function in the osteogenic lineage. ChIP-Seq revealed robust interaction of Shox2 with cis-regulatory enhancers clustering around skeletogenic genes that are also bound by Hox-TALE factors， supporting a lineage autonomous function of Shox2 in osteogenic lineage fate determination and skeleton patterning. Pbx ChIP-Seq further allowed the genome-wide identification of cis-regulatory modules exhibiting co-occupancy of Pbx， Meis， and Shox2 transcriptional regulators. Integrative analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data and transgenic enhancer assays indicate that Shox2 patterns the stylopod as a repressor via interaction with enhancers active in the proximal limb mesenchyme and antagonizes the repressive function of TALE factors in osteogenesis.,Shox2/TALEFor ChIP-Seq， the list of libraries below， including controls， were generated [listed in the format of (antibody)-target-tissue-stage]: (Î±-HA)-Shox2-Limb-E12.5， (Î±-HA)-Shox2-Limb-E13.5， (Î±-HA)-Shox2-Palate-E12.5， (Î±-HA)-Shox2-Limb/Palate-E12.5， (Î±-Pbx)-Pbx-Limb-E12.5， Input (control)， (Î±-HA)-Mixed Limb/Palate from Shox2+/+ mice-E12.5 (control).*The attached signal tracks(*.bigwig) were generated by âbdgcmp (MACS2) to filter out background signal(by filtering against the signal track obtained from (Î±-HA)-Mixed Limb/Palate from Shox2+/+ mice-E12.5 (control)) and subsequently convert to bigwig for analysis and visualization.,27287812,Development
Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis - RNA seq,GSE79812,Mus musculus,Microglia play important roles in life-long brain maintenance and in pathology， but are also crucial in the developing central nervous system; yet their regulatory dynamics during development have not been fully elucidated. Genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling coupled with single-cell transcriptomic analysis throughout development reveal that microglia undergo three temporal developmental stages in synchrony with the brain: early， pre-， and adult microglia， which are under the control of distinct regulatory circuits. Knockout of the transcription factor MafB caused disruption of homeostasis in adulthood and increased inflammation. Environmental perturbations， such as the microbiome or prenatal immune activation， led to dysregulation of the developmental program， particularly in terms of inflammation. Together， our work identifies a stepwise developmental program of microglia integrating immune response pathways that may be associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders.,Yolk sac progenitors (CD45+CD11B+CX3CR1-GFP+)， microglia from early brain (CD45+CD11B+CX3CR1-GFP+)， and microglia from later stages (CD45intCD11BintCX3CR1-GFP+) were isolated from CX3CR1+ C57BL/6J mice or microglia from perturbation models (CD45intCD11Bint) from mice of C57BL/6J background,27338705,Science
Analysis of SDC-2， DPY-26， MIX-1， DPY-27 and RNA Polymerase II ChIP-chip and RNA abundance in C. elegans,GSE16621,Caenorhabditis elegans,In C. elegans， a condensin-like protein complex associates specifically with both X chromosomes of XX animals to execute dosage compensation. Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) reduces the level of transcripts arising from each of the two X chromosomes. Recruitment to X is specified in part by discrete DNA sequence motifs， but following recruitment， the DCC is targeted to the promoters of individual active genes by an unknown mechanism. Here， we investigated three outstanding questions regarding the molecular mechanism of DCC recruitment and spreading along X. By examining the genome-wide binding patterns of several DCC subunits in different stages of C. elegans development， and in strains harboring X:Autosome chromosomal fusions， we provide evidence that: (1) DCC binding is dynamically specified according to gene activity during development (2) The condensin-like subunits of the DCC spread from recruitment sites to active promoters more readily than the non-conserved SDC subunits， which are involved in initial X-targeting and (3) the mechanism of DCC spreading is independent of X-chromosome DNA sequence， and will proceed onto any active promoter near a recruitment site.

Barley transcriptional responses to specialist and generalist spider mite herbivores,GSE83676,Hordeum vulgare,Spider mites， including the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae， TSSM) and the Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis， BGM)， are becoming increasingly important agricultural pests. The TSSM is an extreme generalist documented to feed on more than 1100 plant hosts. In contrast， the BGM is a grass specialist， with hosts including important cereal crops like maize， wheat， sorghum and barley. Historically， studies of plant-herbivore interactions have focused largely on insects. However， far less is known about plant responses to spider mite herbivores， especially in grasses， and whether responses differ between generalists and specialists. To identify plant defense pathways responding to spider mites， we collected time course RNA-seq data from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) infested with TSSMs and BGMs. Additionally， and as a comparison to the physical damage caused by spider mite feeding， a wounding treatment was also included.,The experiment was performed with four biological replicates across each of the following (28 samples in total): no infestation (C， control)， 2hr after wounding (W2)， 24hr after wounding (W24)， 2hr after TSSM infestation (T2)， 24hr after TSSM infestation (T24)， 2hr after BGM infestation (B2)， and 24hr after BGM infestation (B24).,30186298,Front Plant Sci

Transcriptome sequencing analysis of pepper,GSE45037,Capsicum annuum;Capsicum chinense;Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum,To facilitate the functional annotation of the pepper genome， we generated 90.84 Gb of RNA-Seq data from 33 libraries representing all major tissue types and developmental stages of Zunla 1， as well as fruits from other accessions with significant phenotypic differences.,Pepper âZunla 1â and other inbred lines were grown in a greenhouse as described in Table S1， with their different developmental stages Plants at full-bloom stage were harvested for roots， stems， and leaves as the same as the samples for phased small RNAs (see text S3.4.2 for details). Mature plants were harvested for unopened flower buds (buds) and fully open flowers (flowers). Additional flowers were allowed to self-pollinate and fruit was harvested at four pre-breaker stages (1-3cm， 3-4cm， 4-5cm fruit length， and mature green)， the breaker stage (when the fruit was turning red) and three post-breaker stages (3， 5， and 7 days after breaker). These samples will respectively be referred to as Root， Stem， Leaf， Bud， Flower， F-Dev-1， F-Dev-2， F-Dev-3， F-Dev-4， F-Dev-5， F-Dev-6， F-Dev-7， F-Dev-8， and F-Dev-9. Similar roots， stems， leaves， immature fruit and red fruit were harvested from other inbred lines from domesticated Capsicum species. Meanwhile， chiltepin plants were grown under long days at controlled temperature and RNA was extracted from a mix of leaves from four stages (seedling， early blooming， full bloom， and fruit breaker phases)， a mix of flowers from unopened flower buds (buds) and fully open flowers (flowers)， and fruit at breaker and breaker plus five days respectively. All tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80â. Total RNA was isolated from different samples by using the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturerâs instructions. Strand-specific RNA-Seq library preparations were performed as previously described (39) with 12 independently bar-coded samples sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 system.

EPA505 using a designed microarray of 8，048 probes. During the biodegradation kinetics with phenanthrene， fluoranthene or a mix of both pollutants， we identified the targeted set of genes induced by these pollutants， compared to basal expression detected with glucose.Hybridizing total DNA extracted from S3， we show the efficiency of our probe design to study a complex environment. Despite the relative small size of our probes (23-mers)， their sensitivity is reliable as we can detect the presence of genes in this complex mixture.Obtained results are further described in SÃ©bastien Terrat， Eric Peyretaillade， Olivier GonÃ§alves， Eric Dugat-Bony， Fabrice Gravelat， and Pierre Peyret. 2010 - Studying the âUnkownâ with Metabolic Design， a new probe design software for explorative functional microarrays development.

Highly integrated single base resolution maps of the epigenome in Arabidopsis,GSE10877,Arabidopsis thaliana,Whole genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing， small RNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0)， and met1， drm1 drm2 cmt3， and ros1 dml2 dml3 null mutants using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer. A comparison was performed with regions of the genome containing cytosine DNA methylation identified by methylcytosine immunoprecipitation and whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays， for wildtype Col-0.Understanding the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that mediate control of transcription at multiple levels is critical to understanding how plants develop and respond to their environment. We combined next-generation sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technology with novel methods for direct sequencing of the entire cytosine methylome (methylC-seq)， transcriptome (RNA-seq)， and the small RNA component of the transcriptome (smRNA-seq) to create a set of highly integrated epigenome maps for Arabidopsis thaliana， in conjunction with a set of informative mutants defective in DNA methyltransferase and DNA demethylase activity. At single-base resolution we discovered extensive， previously undetected， DNA methylation， identified the context and level of methylation at each site， and found that local composition has effects upon DNA methylation state. Deep sequencing of the smRNAome exposed a direct relationship between the location and abundance of smRNAs and DNA methylation， perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation， and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in the region of RNA-DNA homology. Finally， strand-specific RNA-seq revealed changes in the transcript abundance of hundreds of genes upon alteration of the DNA methylation state， and enabled the identification of numerous previously unidentified genes regulated by DNA methylation.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Whole genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing， small RNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of wildtype Arabidopsis plants (Col-0)， and met1， drm1 drm2 cmt3， and ros1 dml2 dml3 null mutants using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer.

Cross-species comparison of C/EBPÎ± and PPARÎ³ profiles in mouse and human adipocytes reveals interdependent retention of binding sites,GSE27450,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing to map all binding sites of C/EBPÎ± and PPARÎ³ in human SGBS adipocytes and compared these with the genome-wide profiles from mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes to systematically investigate what biological features correlate with retention of sites in orthologous regions between mouse and human. Despite a limited interspecies retention of binding sites， several biological features make sites more likely to be retained. First， co-binding of PPARÎ³ and C/EBPÎ± in mouse is the most powerful predictor of retention of the corresponding binding sites in human. Second， vicinity to genes highly upregulated during adipogenesis significantly increases retention. Third， the presence of C/EBPÎ± consensus sites correlate with retention of both factors， indicating that C/EBPÎ± facilitates recruitment of PPARÎ³. Fourth， retention correlates with overall sequence conservation within the binding regions independent of C/EBPÎ± and PPARÎ³ sequence patterns， indicating that other transcription factors work cooperatively with these two key transcription factors.,C/EBPÎ± and PPARÎ³ ChIP-seq in mouse 3T3-L1 and human SGBS adipocytes.,21410980,BMC Genomics

DNA replication-timing boundaries separate stable chromosome domains with cell-type-specific functions,GSE51334,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as the replication-timing program. In mammals， replication timing is cell type-specific with at least half the genome switching replication timing during development， primarily in units of 400-800 kilobases ('replication domains;)， whose positions are preserved in different cell types， conserved between species， and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements. Early and late replication correlate， respectively， with open and closed three-dimensional chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)， and， to a lesser extent， late replication correlates with lamina-associated domains (LADs). Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled substructure within chromatin compartments called topologically associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to replication domains. However， TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains， challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale.Moreover， attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common， underlying domain structure. Here we localize boundaries of replication domains to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that， collectively， replication domain boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries， whereas within a cell type， adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure replication domain boundaries， largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover， cell-type-specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell-type-specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization and replication timing with developmentally stable structural domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.,Protocols for generating and quality control for replication timing data from microarray hybridization (Repli-chip) or sequencing (Repli-seq) were performed as previously described. CH12， MEL， Gm12878， Gm12801， Gm12812， Gm12813， HeLa-S3， HepG2， HUVEC， IMR90， MCF-7， Sk-N-Sh and NHEK cells were obtained and grown according to standard ENCODE cell culture protocols. Wild-type control and Suz12 knockout naive mESCs were derived from the previously described strain25 and obtained from Anne Laugesen and Kristian Helin and cultured in 2i+LIF medium as previously described. Previously published Repli-chip and Repli-seq3 data sets were also used in this study.,25409831,Nature
BATF-JUN is critical for IRF4-mediated transcription in T cells,GSE39756,Mus musculus,Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is an IRF family transcription factor with critical roles in lymphoid development and in regulating the immune response. IRF4 binds DNA weakly owing to a carboxy-terminal auto-inhibitory domain， but cooperative binding with factors such as PU.1 or SPIB in B cells increases binding affinity， allowing IRF4 to regulate genes containing ETSâIRF composite elements (EICEs; 5'-GGAAnnGAAA-3'). Here we show that in mouse CD4+ T cells， where PU.1/SPIB expression is low， and in B cells， where PU.1 is well expressed， IRF4 unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1) complexes to bind to AP1âIRF4 composite (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3') motifs that we denote as AP1âIRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover， BATFâJUN family protein complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in pre-activated CD4+ T cells stimulated with IL-21 and in TH17 differentiated cells. Importantly， BATF binding was diminished in Irf4-/- T cells and IRF4 binding was diminished in Batf-/- T cells， consistent with functional cooperation between these factors. Moreover， we show that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10 gene， which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by IL-21. These findings reveal that IRF4 can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the cellular context， thus indicating new approaches for modulating IRF4-dependent transcription.,Genome-wide transcription factors mapping and binding of IRF4， BATF， IRF8， STAT3， JUN etc in WT， Irf4-/- and Batf-/- mice in different cell types (B cells， CD4+ T cells and TH17 cells) cultured with or without IL-21 was conducted. RNA-Seq is conducted in mouse B cells， CD4+ T cells， TH1/TH2/TH9/TH17/Treg.,22992523,Nature

MBNL Sequestration by Toxic RNAs and RNA Mis-Processing in the Myotonic Dystrophy Brain,GSE68890,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,For some neurological disorders， disease is primarily RNA-mediated due to expression of non-coding microsatellite expansion RNAs (RNAexp). Toxicity is thought to result from enhanced binding of proteins to these expansions and depletion from their normal cellular targets. However， experimental evidence for this sequestration model is lacking. Here， we use HITS-CLIP and pre-mRNA processing analysis of human control versus myotonic dystrophy (DM) brains to provide compelling evidence for this RNA toxicity model. MBNL2 binds directly to DM repeat expansions in the brain resulting in depletion from its normal RNA targets with downstream effects on alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Similar RNA processing defects were detected in Mbnl compound knockout mice， highlighted by dysregulation of Mapt splicing and fetal tau isoform expression in adults. These results demonstrate that MBNL proteins are directly sequestered by RNAexp in the DM brain and introduce a powerful experimental tool to evaluate RNA-mediated toxicity in other expansion diseases.,HITS-CLIP analysis was performed to identify RNA binding sites of MBNL2 in control， DM type 1 (DM1)， and DM type 2 (DM2) autopsy-derived brain (n=3).  Two regions of the brain selected for the study included the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Libraries were sequenced and wiggle files were generated for each biological replicate as well as three pooled biological replicates (3BRs) per group (control， DM1， and DM2).  In addition， differential CLIP analysis (dCLIP) was performed to normalize binding data between groups and identify statistically significant changes in binding.  The dCLIP analysis generated bedgraph files representing normalized binding profiles of MBNL2 in each group (control， DM1， and DM2) for visualization and comparative analysis.PolyA-seq was performed on control， DM1， and DM2 autopsy-derived brain samples (hippocampus and frontal cortex， n=3) as well as wild-type (WT) and Mbnl1; Mbnl2 conditional double knockout (Mbnl1-/-; Mbnl2c/c; Nestin-Cre+/- or DKO) brain (n=3).  Libraries were sequenced and the resultant files were processed and aligned to the reference genomes (hg19 and mm10).  Further computational processing was performed to remove internal oligo(dT) mis-priming events， identify valid polyA sites， and trim to the exact polyA sites.  BedGraph files were generated for each group in human (control， DM1， and DM2) and mouse (WT and Mbnl DKO) for comparative visualization.,26257173,Cell Rep
Multiplexed engineering and analysis of endogenous enhancer activity in single cells: Mosaic-Seq of 15 SEs， 71 HSs， 241 sgRNAs,GSE81750,Homo sapiens,Transcriptional enhancers orchestrate cell-type specific gene expression programs critical to eukaryotic development， physiology， and disease. However， despite the large number of enhancers now identified， only a small number have been functionally assessed. Here， we develop MOsaic Single-cell Analysis by Indexed CRISPR Sequencing (Mosaic-seq)， a method that measures one direct phenotype of enhancer repression: change of the transcriptome， at the single cell level. Using dCas9-KRAB to suppress enhancer function， we first implement a multiplexed system to allow the simultaneous measurement of the transcriptome and detection of sgRNAs by single cell RNA sequencing. We validate this approach by targeting the HS2 enhancer in the well-studied beta-globin locus. Next， through computational simulation， we demonstrate strategies to robustly detect changes in gene expression in these single cell measurements. Finally， we use Mosaic-seq to target 71 hypersensitive regions belonging to 15 super-enhancers in K562 cells by utilizing a lentiviral library containing 241 unique-barcoded sgRNAs. Our results demonstrate that Mosaic-seq is a reliable approach to study enhancer function in single cells in a high-throughput manner.,The overall design consists of RNA sequencing in bulk and in single K562 cells. As a control， we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of K562 cells expressing dCas9-KRAB and a control sgRNA targeting the non-expressed HSBP1 gene in two biological replicates. As a pilot project， we performed single cell RNA-Seq of dCas9-KRAB K562 cells after pooled infection of a library of 10 sgRNA viruses targeting promoters and enhancers in the beta-globin locus. As controls for this experiment， we individually infected these 10 sgRNAs and either performed 1) bulk RNA sequencing or 2) single cell RNA sequencing after pooling the separately infected cells. Finally， we scaled this single-cell approach to measure transcriptome changes for a library of 241 sgRNAs spanning 71 hypersensitive sites from 15 super-enhancers in K562 cells.,28416141,Mol Cell
Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901:del_MMP1100， a shift from a H2-excess and P-limiting condition to a H2-limited and P-excess condition in chemostats (growth rate held constant),GSE42162,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. For shifts from P-limited to P-excess conditions， phosphate was raised from 0.18 mM to the standard 0.8 mM. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
Global epigenomic analysis of primary human pancreatic islets provides insights into type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci,GSE23784,Homo sapiens,Identifying cis-regulatory elements is important to understand how human pancreatic islets modulate gene expression in physiologic or pathophysiologic (e.g.， diabetic) conditions. We conducted genome-wide analysis of DNase I hypersensitive sites， histone H3 lysine methylation marks (K4me1， K4me3， K79me2)， and CCCTC factor (CTCF) binding in human islets. This identified ~18，000 putative promoters (several hundred novel and islet-active). Surprisingly， active promoter marks were absent at genes encoding islet-specific hormones， suggesting a distinct regulatory mechanism. Of 34，039 distal (non-promoter) regulatory elements， 47% are islet-unique and 22% are CTCF-bound.

Transcriptome analysis of Osbhlh148 mutant plants under controlled drought stress and well-watered conditions at vegetative stage,GSE65024,Oryza sativa Japonica Group,The members of bHLH transcription factor superfamily are known to play key role in plant development and abiotic stress response. Loss-of-function of OsbHLH148 gene resulted in increased sensitivity of rice plants to drought stress. To identify the targets of OsbHLH148 and dissect the drought stress response pathway regulated by it， we performed transcriptome profiling of Osbhlh148 mutant plants under drought stress as well as well-watered conditions by RNA-sequencing.,OsbHLH148 loss-of-function rice plants (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) were exposed to controlled drought stress and well-watered conditions at the vegetative stage. Controlled drought (DR) stress was applied on 45 day old plants following gravimetric approach. The soil water content was brought down to 40% field capacity over a period of 3-4 days and plants were maintained at that level for 10 days by weighing the pots daily at a fixed time of the day and replenishing the water lost through evapotranspiration. Another set of plants were maintained at 100% FC as well-watered (WW) condition. Total RNA isolated from leaf tissue was used for RNA-sequencing. Two biological replicates per sample were sequenced. cDNA library was constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Plant kit (Illumina). Sequencing was carried out on each library to generate 50 bp SE reads using Illumina High-Seq 2000 platform. The transcriptome reads were mapped to the rice reference genome sequence (MSU 7.0) with tophat1.3.1 using the programâs default parameters (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu). Mapped RNA-Seq reads were assembled into transcripts by Cufflinks (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/) and differentially expressed genes were identified by using Cuffdiff.,34249082,Front Genet
The B cell identity factor Pax5 regulates distinct transcriptional programs in early and late B lymphopoiesis,GSE38046,Mus musculus,Pax5 controls the identity and development of B cells by repressing lineage-inappropriate genes and activating B-cell-specific genes. Here， we used genome-wide approaches to identify Pax5 target genes in pro-B and mature B cells. In these cell types， Pax5 bound to 40% of the cis- regulatory elements defined by mapping Dnase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites， transcription start sites and histone modifications. Although Pax5 bound to 8，000 target genes， it regulated only 4% of them in pro-B and mature B cells by inducing enhancers at activated genes and eliminating DHS sites at repressed genes. Pax5-regulated genes in pro-B cells account for 23% of all expression changes occurring between common lymphoid progenitors and committed pro-B cells， which identifies Pax5 as an important regulator of this developmental transition. Regulated Pax5 target genes minimally overlap in pro-B and mature B cells， which reflects massive expression changes between these cell types. Hence， Pax5 controls B cell identity and function by regulating distinct target genes in early and late B lymphopoiesis.,44 samples (16 RNA-seq， 15 ChIP-seq，  6 DHS-seq， 5 Bio-ChIP-seq， 2 CAGE-seq).

Analysis of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation by 3' region extraction and deep sequencing,GSE42398,Mus musculus,Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) generates diverse mRNA isoforms. We developed 3' region extraction and deep sequencing (3'READS) to address mispriming issues that commonly plague poly(A) site (pA) identification， and we used the method to comprehensively map pAs in the mouse genome. Thorough annotation of gene 3' ends revealed over 5，000 previously overlooked pAs (~8% of total) flanked by A-rich sequences， underscoring the necessity of using an accurate tool for pA mapping. About 79% of mRNA genes and 66% of long noncoding RNA genes undergo APA， but these two gene types have distinct usage patterns for pAs in introns and upstream exons. Quantitative analysis of APA isoforms by 3'READS indicated that promoter-distal pAs， regardless of intron or exon locations， become more abundant during embryonic development and cell differentiation and that upregulated isoforms have stronger pAs， suggesting global modulation of the 3' endâprocessing activity in development and differentiation.,3'READS to map pAs in mouse genome,23241633,Nat Methods

Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
Analysis of an artificial zinc finger epigenetic modulator: widespread binding but limited regulation,GSE59980,Homo sapiens,Artificial transcription factors (ATFs) and genomic nucleases based on a DNA binding platform consist- ing of multiple zinc finger domains are currently be- ing developed for clinical applications. However， no genome-wide investigations into their binding speci- ficity have been performed. We have created six- finger ATFs to target two different 18 nt regions of the human SOX2 promoter; each ATF is constructed such that it contains or lacks a super KRAB do- main (SKD) that interacts with a complex contain- ing repressive histone methyltransferases. ChIP-seq analysis of the effector-free ATFs in MCF7 breast cancer cells identified thousands of binding sites， mostly in promoter regions; the addition of an SKD domain increased the number of binding sites â¼5- fold， with a majority of the new sites located out- side of promoters. De novo motif analyses suggest that the lack of binding specificity is due to sub- sets of the finger domains being used for genomic interactions. Although the ATFs display widespread binding， few genes showed expression differences; genes repressed by the ATF-SKD have stronger bind- ing sites and are more enriched for a 12 nt motif. Interestingly， epigenetic analyses indicate that the transcriptional repression caused by the ATF-SKD is not due to changes in active histone modifications.,ATF plasmids were designed and stably integrated into MCF7 cells as described in (Stolzenburg et al. 2012).  Stable lines were grown at 30â80% confluency in Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagleâs Medium (Corning， Corning， NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen， Life Technologies， Grand Island， NY) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin; cells were selected using 5 Âµg/ml puromycin (VWR， Radnor， PA) and 200 Âµg/ml G418 (VWR， Radnor， PA). ATF expression was induced by treatment with media containing 1Âµg/ml doxycycline (VWR， Radnor， PA) at 0 h， doxycycline media was refreshed at 48 h， and cells were harvested at 72 h. ATF expression was confirmed by hemagglutinin (HA) tag western blot prior to HA ChIP-seq， histone ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis.  For HA-tag ChIP-seq， stable MCF7 cell lines were induced using 100 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma) at 0 h， doxycycline media was refreshed at 48 h， and cells were harvested at 72 h by crosslinking in a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde. Crosslinking was stopped after 5 min by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. Crosslinked cells were washed in cold phosphate buffered saline， lysed using 1 mL low-salt IP buffer (150 mM NaCl， 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5)， 5 mM EDTA， NP-40 (0.5%)， Triton X-100 (1%) containing protease inhibitors) and aliquoted at 1 Ã 10â§7 cells/mL. Cells are then sonicated to a fragment size range of 500â800 bp. Samples were then diluted in 1 mL low-salt buffer and incubated with 3 ÂµL of anti-HA antibody (Covance， Princeton， NJ). Three-hundred microliter Sepharose A beads (GE Healthcare Life Science) were used for pull-down. Samples were sequenced at the UNC-CH Genome Analysis Facil- ity (Chapel Hill， NC) on an HiSeq (Illumina， San Diego， CA) to read counts of 4.1â67.3 M total reads. For histone ChIP-seq， antibodies to H3K4me3 (Cell Signaling Tech- nologies CST9751)， H3K9Ac (Cell Signaling Technologies CST9649) and H3K9me3 (Diagenode pAb-056-050) were used; samples were prepared as previously described (OâGeen et al. 2011).,25122745,Nucleic Acids Res
Heterogeneous effects of massive hypoxia pathway activation in kidney cancer,GSE67237,Homo sapiens,General activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways is classically associated with adverse prognosis in cancer and has been proposed to contribute to oncogenic drive. In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) HIF pathways are upregulated by inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor. However HIF-1a and HIF-2a have contrasting effects on experimental tumour progression. To better understand this paradox we examined pan-genomic patterns of HIF DNA binding and associated gene expression in response to manipulation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a and related the findings to CCRC prognosis. Our findings reveal distinct pan-genomic organization of HIF isoform-specific DNA binding at thousands of sites. Overall associations were observed between HIF-1a-specific binding， and genes associated with favourable prognosis and between HIF-2a-specific binding and adverse prognosis.  However within each isoform-specific set， individual gene associations were heterogeneous in sign and magnitude， suggesting that activation of each HIF-a isoform contributes a highly complex mix of pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects,ChIP and RNASeq of HIF-1a and HIF-2a transfection in 786-O cell lines,26262842,PLoS One
Hormonal and stress-response pathways regulate naked mole rat eusociality,GSE67542,Heterocephalus glaber,Naked mole rats live in eusocial colonies where subordinates help a single dominant female and a few males to breed. We investigated the genome-wide regulatory mechanisms underlying their reproductive division of labor by examining brain and gonad transcriptomes and DNA-methylomes. Subtle expression differences were observed between brains of dominants and subordinates， but differentially expressed genes clustered consistently in a module with similar function for both sexes. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH1) was central in this module and linked with stress-response genes such as neuropeptide Y and corticotrophin-releasing hormone. Breeder-subordinate modifications in DNA methylation were substantial in male brains and associated with the GNRH1 module. The GNRH1-regulated estrogen synthesis pathway was completely blocked in subordinate ovaries and sperm-related genes were significantly down-regulated in subordinate testes. Our results indicate that reproductive suppression is based on hormonal- and stress-related control by the dominant female， but with significant differences in molecular mechanisms between males and females.,Naked mole rats were housed in our laboratory. Animals were sacrificed， and the tissues immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were obtained from male (n = 2) and female (n = 2) breeders as well as male (n = 2) and female (n = 2) non-breeders (subordinates). We analyzed brains from all eight individuals separately， but female ovaries were only large enough for individual analysis in breeders， whereas subordinate ovaries were so small that 3â5 of them had to be pooled for gene expression analyses. The testes of breeding and non-breeding males were not visually different， but breeder status was known because these males had previously sired pups.,nan,
Integrated analysis of transcript level regulation of metabolism during human adipocyte differentiation [T0901317],GSE41577,Homo sapiens,Here， we have focused on studying the link between metabolic changes driven by the differentiation into mature adipocytes of a human preadipocyte cell line (SGBS) and their regulation， through a combined experimental and computational approach.By collecting data on gene expression， PPARg， CEBPa， LXR and H3K4me3 genome-wide ChIP-seq profles and transcriptome-wide microRNA target identification for miR-27a， miR29a and miR-222， and using constraint-based modeling to estimate metabolic reaction activity， we obtained a comprehensive set of information highlighting how epigenetic， transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation impacts the metabolic network.,Illumina HT12 V3.0 microarrays: LXR ligand activation with 1 microM T0901317 for 4 h in SGBS day 10 differentiated adipocytes (6 samples， treatment vs control， in triplicate)This submission represents transcriptome component of study.,24198249,Nucleic Acids Res

Human Nonsense-Mediated RNA Decay Initiates Widely by Endonucleolysis and Targets snoRNA Host Genes,GSE57433,Homo sapiens,Eukaryotic RNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) are eliminated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). While human nonsense RNA degradation can be initiated either by an endonucleolytic cleavage event near the PTC or through decapping， the individual contribution of these activities on endogenous substrates has remained unresolved. Here we unambiguously establish that SMG6-catalyzed endonucleolysis is the primary initiating step in human nonsense RNA decay. We also show that both protein-coding and ânon-codingâ genes hosting snoRNAs in their introns produce considerable amounts of NMD-sensitive splice variants， suggesting that these RNAs are merely by-products of a primary snoRNA production process. Finally， genes encoding multiple snoRNAs generally yield elevated numbers of alternative transcript isoforms， enabling the differential expression of individual snoRNAs. These findings demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential for decoupling of the individual expression levels of functional exon- and intron-encoded species from such composite genes.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This article was corrected inhttp://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/30/9/1128.shortCompletely mapped 5'p-end sequencing data from the corrigendum have been updated in corresponding samples.,HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex cells were subjected to siRNA-mediated depletion of XRN1 and co-depletion of XRN1 with either SMG6 or UPF1. All the treated samples together with the controls were subjected to both RNA-seq and 5'-end-seq. RNA-seq was used for detecting NMD isoforms and their expression levels. 5'-end-seq was used for finding NMD decay intermediates (decapped and endocleaved molecules). CAGE was used to distinguish decapped from endocleaved RNA fragments.,25403180,Genes Dev
TG-interacting factor1 (Tgif1) maintains the identity of mouse ES cells by counterbalancing the expression of ES cell core factors,GSE55404,Mus musculus,TG-interacting factor1 (Tgif1) is well-known as a transcriptional repressor in transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) signaling pathway. Target mapping of ES cell core factors in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells revealed that Tgif1 is occupied by Oct4 and Nanog. Moreover， recent interactome study of mouse gene regulatory regions showed a preferential regulation of Tgif1 by mouse ES cell specific enhancers. However， the detailed role and mode of actions of Tgif1 in stem cell maintenance and development remains elusive. We show that Tgif1 is indispensable for self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Aberrant expression of Tgif1 promotes differentiation of ES cells even in the presence of LIF in part by deregulation of pluripotency factors. Intriguingly， we find that Tgif1 level is a critical factor to determine specific lineage commitment in a dosage-dependent manner. We further show that Tgif1 interacts with ES cell core factors and co-localizes at their binding sites， which eventually restricts expression of ES cell core factors including Oct4， Sox2， and Nanog. Taken together， we provide new insights into the roles of Tgif1 in maintenance as well as differentiation of ES cells.,ChIP sequenicngs were performed for 5 transcription factors (Tgif1， Tgif2， Nanog， Hdac1 and Smad3) in mouse ES cells. Nanog ChIP was performed using bioChIP-seq.  Control ChIP-seq was performed using BirA cells.,26411691,Cell Rep
Ptr-miR397a is a negative regulator of laccase genes affecting lignin content in Populus trichocarpa,GSE54153,Populus trichocarpa,Laccases were proposed to catalyze the oxidative polymerization of monolignols. We identified 49 laccase gene models in Populus trichocarpa， of which 29 were predicted to be targets of ptr-miR397a. We overexpressed Ptr-MIR397a in transgenic P. trichocarpa. In each of all 9 transgenic lines tested， 17 PtrLACs were down-regulated as analyzed by RNA-seq. Transgenic lines with severe reduction in the expression of these laccase genes resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in the total laccase activity. Overexpression of Ptr-MIR397a in these transgenic lines also reduced lignin content， whereas levels of all monolignol biosynthetic gene transcripts remained unchanged. A hierarchical genetic regulatory network (GRN) built by a bottom-up Graphic Gaussian Model algorithm provides additional support for a role of ptr-miR397a as a negative regulator of laccases for lignin biosynthesis. Full transcriptome based differential gene expression in the overexpressed transgenics and protein domain analyses implicate previously unidentified transcription factors and their targets in an extended hierarchical GRN including ptr-miR397a and laccases that coregulate lignin biosynthesis in wood formation. Ptr-miR397a， laccases and other regulatory components of this network may provide additional strategies for genetic manipulation of lignin content.,Total twelve trees were used. Those include nine individual transgenic trees for overexpressing Ptr-miR397a， as nine biological replicates， and three wild-type trees.,23754401,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
PROP1 triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like process in pituitary stem cells [RNA-Seq],GSE77357,Mus musculus,Mutations in PROP1 are the most common cause of hypopituitarism in humans; therefore， unraveling its mechanism of action is highly relevant from a therapeutic perspective. Our current understanding of the role of PROP1 in the pituitary gland is limited to the regulation of pituitary transcription factors Hesx1 and Pit1.  To elucidate the comprehensive PROP1-dependent gene regulatory network， we conducted genome wide analysis of PROP1 DNA binding and effects on gene expression in mutant tissues， isolated stem cells and engineered cell lines. We determined that PROP1 is essential for maintaining proliferation of stem cells and stimulating them to undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like process necessary for cell migration and differentiation. Genomic profiling reveals that PROP1 binds to and represses claudin 23， characteristic of epithelial cells， and it activates EMT inducer genes: Zeb2， Notch2 and Gli2.  Our findings identify PROP1 as a central transcriptional component of pituitary stem cell differentiation.,Pituitary Colony forming cells mRNA of 13-day old wild type (Prop1 +/+)， Prop1 mutants (Prop1df/df)， wild type (Pit1+/+) and Pit1 mutants (Pit1 dw/dw) mice were generated by deep sequencing， in triplicates.,27351100,Elife

Small RNA profiling reveals deregulated PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway in asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle cells,GSE64744,Homo sapiens,Background: Aberrant expression of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs)， in particular microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) define several pathological processes. Asthma is characterized by airway hyper-reactivity， chronic inflammation and airway wall remodeling. Asthma-specific miRNA profiles were reported for bronchial epithelial cells， but no information on sncRNA expression in asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) cells is available.Objective: To determine whether primary BSM sncRNA expression profile is altered in asthma and identify targets of differentially expressed sncRNAs.Methods: SmallRNA sequencing was used for sncRNA profiling in BSM cells (8 asthma， 6 non-asthma). sncRNA identification and differential expression analysis was performed with iMir， . experimentally validated miRNA targets were identified with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and putative piRNA targets with miRanda.Results: Asthmatic BSM cells showed abnormal expression of 32 sncRNAs (26 miRNAs， 5 piRNAs， and 1 snoRNA). Target prediction for deregulated miRNAs and piRNAs revealed experimentally validated and predicted mRNA targets expressed in the BSM cells. 38 of these mRNAs represent major targets for deregulated miRNAs and may play important roles in the pathophysiology of asthma. Interestingly， 6 such miRNAs were previously associated with asthma and/or considered as novel therapeutic targets for treatment of this disease. Signaling pathway analysis revealed involvement of these sncRNAs in increased cell proliferation via PTEN and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.Conclusions: BSM cells from asthma patients are characterized by aberrant sncRNA expression that recapitulates multiple pathological phenotypes of these cells.Implications: sncRNA expression profiling performed in this study further improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma-associated processes in lungs.,SmallRNA and mRNA profiles of primary bronchial smooth muscle cells from 8 asthmatic and 6 healthy donors were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq1500 and NextSeq respectively.,nan,
The ground-state and evolution of promoter directionality revealed by a functional evolutionary approach,GSE87735,Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Debaryomyces hansenii;Kluyveromyces lactis,Although the RNA polymerase (Pol) II machinery inherently initiates transcription in one direction， promoter regions are often âbidirectionalâ in vivo， giving rise to divergent RNA transcripts， many of which are non-coding and highly unstable. Here， we use a functional evolutionary approach to address whether bidirectional promoter regions are a mechanistic consequence of Pol II transcription or serve an evolved biological function.  This involves nascent transcript mapping in S. cerevisiae strains containing large segments of foreign， and hence evolutionarily irrelevant， yeast DNA.  Promoter regions in foreign species environments lose the directionality they have in their native species， indicating that DNA sequences and proteins co-evolve to promote directional transcription. Furthermore， fortuitous promoters emerge frequently in foreign DNA， and these produce equal transcription in both directions. Thus， without evolutionary pressure， the transcriptional ground state of promoter regions is intrinsically bidirectional. Interestingly， promoter regions of newly evolved genes tend to promote bidirectional transcription， and when fortuitous promoters arise in evolution， transcription factor binding sites are either purged through mutation or retained to enable new functionality. These results indicate that promoter regions are intrinsically bidirectional and are shaped by evolution to bias transcription of coding transcripts while suppressing non-coding transcriptional noise.,We transferred artificial chromosomes made of DNA extracted from K. lactis and  D. hansenii to S. cerevisiae and performed NET-Seq,28803729,Cell
RNA sequencing of monocytes and microglia from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis illustrates a changing phenotype with disease course,GSE59725,Mus musculus,The role of microglia and infiltrating monocytes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) pathogenesis has been controversial. To gain insight into their respective roles， we developed a method for differentiating between microglia and infiltrating monocytes in the CNS using CD44. We used this system to monitor changes in cell number， activation status， and gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) over the course of disease. This in vivo characterization and RNA-Seq dataset improves our understanding of myeloid cell biology in the brain under inflammatory conditions and may lead to strategies to identify therapies for inflammatory pathways active in neuroinflammatory diseases.,Pooled samples from 10 mice were analyzed for both microglia and monocytes at distinct timepoints post EAE inducation.  Peritoneal macrophages were isolated and analyzed for five samples， and also in a pool.,25270668,J Neuroimmunol
ChIP-seq analysis of E2f4， H3K4me2 and H3K27ac in the mouse livers,GSE76927,Mus musculus,Arid1a is the subunit of SWI/SNF complex， which was reported to guide SWI/SNF to DNA. Here， we found that loss of Arid1a in the liver  results in improved liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.Genome-wide analysis showed that after hepatectomy，loss of Arid1a reduces the recruitment and activity of E2F4 on target promoters， resulting in expression programs that favor regeneration during injury. Correspondingly， these promoters showed increased H3k4me2 and H3k27ac marks， indicating de-repression of these E2f target genes.,The post partial hepatectomy mice liver cells were fixed and isolated， analysis of genomic occupancy of E2f4，H3K4me2，H3K27ac in  hepatocytes from Arid1a WT and Arid1a liver specific KO mice by ChIP-seq.,27044474,Cell Stem Cell
Characterization of genetic loss-of-function of Fus in zebrafish,GSE85554,Danio rerio,The RNA-binding protein FUS is implicated in transcription， alternative splicing of neuronal genes and DNA repair. Mutations in FUS have been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We genetically disrupted fus in zebrafish (Danio rerio) using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The fus knockout animals are fertile and did not show any distinctive phenotype. Mutation of fus induces mild changes in gene expression on the transcriptome and proteome level in the adult brain. We observed a significant influence of genetic background on gene expression and 3âUTR usage， which could mask the effects of loss of Fus. Unlike published fus morphants， maternal zygotic fus mutants do not show motoneuronal degeneration and exhibit normal locomotor activity.,"We performed paired-end sequencing (100bp reads) of the polyA+ transcriptome from brains of five individuals with Fus-/- genotype and four with Fus wild type genotype. Note on RNA-Seq replicates: after performing first RNA sequencing on four replicates of Fus-/- and WT (labeled with the prefix ""Sample_imb_ketting_2014_13_"") we received a notice from Illumina stating a problem with the library preparation kit lot that was used to prepare the libraries. Due to that， we performed RNA sequencing a second time， using the same input RNA， except for the Fus knockout replicate #3， because there was not enough input RNA left. Instead， a different Fus knockout replicate (#1) was sequenced. However， we compared the mapped reads from sequencing run 1 and sequencing run 2 using plotCorrelaction from DeepTools， and the samples are highly correlated (at least 0.97 and 0.95， Spearman and Pearson correlation respectively). Therefore， we considered first (""Sample_imb_ketting_2014_13_"") and second sequencing runs as technical replicates.",27898262,RNA Biol
Arid1a promotes tumor initiation but restrains progression and metastasis in liver cancer [RNA-seq],GSE95537,Mus musculus,ARID1A is hypothesized to be one of the most common tumor suppressors in human cancer.  However， the functional consequences of ARID1A gain and loss are not clear. We report that  mice with complete liver-specific Arid1a deficiency were resistant to MYC induced  liver carcinogenesis， indicating a requirement during tumor initiation. Mechanistically， Arid1a loss  constrained tumor formation by reducing Cytochrome P450 expression， which in turn mitigated  oxidative stress. We also examined the heterozygous state and found it potentiated metastasis formation and heterozygous has similar gene expression pattern with homozygous compared to WT.,Liver tumor tissues were collected from LAP-MYC; Arid1a WT，Arid1a Het and Arid1a Homo knockout mice， then transcriptional profiling were generated by RNA-seq analysis.Liver tissues were collected from Rag1-/-; LAP-MYC; Arid1a WT with ad-cre or ad-ARID1A overexpression mice， then transcriptional profiling were generated by RNA-seq analysis.,29136504,Cancer Cell
Species- and condition-specific adaptation of the transcriptional landscapes in Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis,GSE41749,Candida albicans;Candida dubliniensis,Although Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis are most closely related， both species significantly behave differently with respect to morphogenesis and virulence. In order to gain further insight into the divergent routes for morphogenetic adaptation in both species， we investigated qualitative along with quantitative differences in the transcriptomes of both organisms by cDNA deep sequencing. Following genome-associated assembly of sequence reads we were able to generate experimentally verified databases containing 6016 and 5972 genes for C. albicans and C. dubliniensis， respectively. About 95% of the transcriptionally active regions (TARs) contain open reading frames while the remaining TARs most likely represent non-coding RNAs. Comparison of our annotations with publically available gene models for C. albicans and C. dubliniensis confirmed approximately 95% of already predicted genes， but also revealed so far unknown novel TARs in both species. Qualitative cross-species analysis of these databases revealed in addition to 5802 orthologs also 399 and 49 species-specific protein coding genes for C. albicans and C. dubliniensis， respectively. Furthermore， quantitative transcriptional profiling using RNA-Seq revealed significant differences in the expression of orthologs across both species. We defined a core subset of 84 hyphal-specific genes required for both species， as well as a set of 42 genes that seem to be specifically induced during hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans. Species specific adaptation in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis is governed by individual genetic repertoires but also by altered regulation of conserved orthologs on the transcriptional level.,We investigated qualitative along with quantitative differences in the transcriptomes of both organisms by cDNA deep sequencing. In a first step， we reevaluated the in silico predicted gene models by collecting experimental data using FLX - technology for sequencing strand-specific and normalized cDNA libraries derived from blastospores and hyphae. In the second step， quantitative RNA-Seq (GAIIX) was applied to C. albicans hyphal cells and C. dubliniensis blastospore and hyphal cells to complement reevaluation of the gene models with FLX data as well as to measure differential gene expression across the species with two biological replicates.,23547856,BMC Genomics
Discrimination of Stem Cell Status after Subjecting Cynomolgus Monkey Pluripotent Stem Cells to Naive Conversion,GSE87576,Macaca fascicularis,Experimental animal models have played an indispensable role in the development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) research. The， derivation of high-quality (so-called âtrue Naive stateâ) iPSCs of non-human primates enhances their application and safety for human regenerative medicine. Although several attempts have been made to convert human and non-human primate PSCs into a truly Naive state， it is unclear which evaluation methods can discriminate them as being truly Naive. Here we derived Naive-like Cynomolgus monkey (Cm) (Macaca fascicularis) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs， and evaluated their potential as a highly accurate indicator of the properties of Naive-like human ESC/iPS cells. Several characteristics of Naive-like Cm ESCs including colony morphology， teratoma-forming ability， leukaemia inhibitory factor dependency， and mitochondrial respiration were confirmed. Next， we generated Cm iPSCs and converted them to a Naive-like state. When these were subjected to in vitro differentiation， some exhibited heterogeneity and showed resistance to differentiation. The difficulty of achieving chimeric contribution to mouse or rabbit embryos suggested incomplete Naive conversion. Actually， transcriptomic comparison of PSCs with early Cm embryos elucidated the partial achievement of Naive conversion. This study offers valuable pointers for deriving true Naive PSCs while avoiding irrelevant or misleading evidence of Naive-like features.,RNAseq analysis of cynomolgus monkey ESCs/iPSCs cultured in Primed， Naive-like and Differentiated conditions using SC3-seq technology.,28349944,Sci Rep
Comparative analysis reveals genomic features of stress-induced transcriptional readthrough,GSE98906,Mus musculus,Transcription is a highly regulated process， and stress-induced changes in gene transcription have been shown to play a major role in responses and adaptation to stress. Numerous emerging genome-wide studies reveal prevalent transcription beyond known protein-coding gene loci， generating a variety of new classes of RNAs， most of unknown function. One such class， termed downstream of gene (DoG)-containing transcripts， was reported to result from transcriptional readthrough upon osmotic stress in human cell lines. However， how widespread the readthrough phenomenon is， and what its causes and consequences are， remain elusive. Here we present a systematic genome-wide mapping of transcriptional readthrough， using deep nuclear RNA-seq， comparing heat shock， osmotic and oxidative stress in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. We observe massive induction of transcriptional readthrough under all stress conditions， with significant， yet not complete overlap of readthrough-induced loci between different conditions. Importantly， our analyses suggest that stress-induced transcriptional readthrough is not a random failure process， but is rather differentially induced across different conditions. Additionally， analyzing public Pol-II occupancy data further supported our findings of stress-induced readthrough. We explore potential regulators and find a role for HSF1 in the induction of a subset of heat shock-induced readthrough transcripts. Furthermore， we examine genomic features of readthrough transcription， and observe a unique chromatin signature typical of DoG-producing regions， suggesting that readthrough transcription is associated with the maintenance of an open chromatin state.,RNA profiles of NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) cells after three stress treatments and control were generated by deep sequencing， in two replicates using Illumina HiSeq 2000.,28928151,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
Spatiotemporal analysis of shade-induced transcriptional reprogramming in Arabidopsis reveals patterns underlying organ-specific growth,GSE81202,Arabidopsis thaliana,In response to neighbor proximity plants increase growth of specific organs (e.g. hypocotyl) to enhance access to sunlight. Shade enhances the activity of Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs) by releasing those bHLH transcription factors from phytochrome B-mediated inhibition. PIFs promote elongation by inducing auxin production in cotyledons. In order to elucidate spatiotemporal aspects of the neighbor proximity response， we analyzed changes in transcript abundance at different time points during a shade treatment in dissected cotyledons and hypocotyls. We concentrated our analysis on these two organs because the former is considered as the primary shade-sensing organ while elongation is rapidly triggered in the hypocotyl. We conclude that PIFs initiate transcriptional reprogramming in both organs within 15 minutes comprising regulated expression of several early auxin response genes. This suggests that hypocotyl growth is elicited by both local and distal auxin signals. With time the transcriptional response diverges increasingly between organs. We identify genes whose differential expression may underlie organ-specific elongation. Finally， we uncover a growth promotion gene expression signature shared between responses to different environments and organs.,Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 was grown for 5 days in a 16 h : 8 h， light : dark photoperiod at 21Â°C on one horizontal plate of c. 140 mm in diameter per sample. Each plate contained 25 ml Â½ MS medium covered with a nylon mesh. On day 6 at ZT2， seedlings were either kept in high R/FR or transferred to low R/FR. After 0， 15， 45， 90 or 180 min after the onset of low R/FR samples of both light qualities were imbibed within 75 sec in ice-cold 100 % (v/v) acetone and two times subjected to about 600 mbar below atmospheric pressure for 5 min while remaining on ice. The dissection of acetone-fixed seedlings was carried out in 70 % (v/v) 4Â°C-cold ethanol under a binocular lens. Cotyledon and hypocotyl material of 50 seedlings per sample were collected in 100 % (v/v) ethanol. For each time point and light condition duplicates were prepared. Plant materials were manually ground using pestles and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (QIAGen) with on-column DNA digestion， according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Finally RNA samples were precipitated using 3M NAOH (pH 5.2) and 100 % (v/v) ethanol. The precipitate was visualize with glycogen and washed with 80 % (v/v) ice-cold ethanol. Stranded libraries were prepared using 400 ng high quality RNA using the TruSeq protocol according to th manufacturerâs instructions (Illumina). This included RNA purification steps using AMPure XP beads and cDNA preparation using a mix of random and polyA primer. RNA-seq libraries were subsequently sequenced with a HISEQ 2500 (Illumina) in the Genome Technology Facility (GTF).,27923878,Plant Cell

We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. For shifts from P-limited to P-excess conditions， phosphate was raised from 0.12 mM to the standard 0.8 mM. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
Selection of epigenetic variation in Arabidopsis [Bisulfite-Seq],GSE36845,Arabidopsis thaliana,In Arabidopsis thaliana a high rate of spontaneous epigenetic variation can occur in the DNA methylome in the absence of genetic variation and selection. It has been of great interest， whether natural epigenetic variation is subject to selection and contributes to fitness and adaptation in selective environments. We compared the variation in selected phenotypic traits， genome-wide cytosine DNA methylation and gene expression in two Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines， which had undergone five generations of selection in experimental landscapes relative to their genetically identical ancestors. Selected populations exerted significant differences in flowering time and the number of branches and fruits， differences that were maintained over two to three generations in the absence of selection. We identified 4，629 and 5，158 differentially methylated cytosines which were overrepresented in genes that regulate flowering time， epigenetic processes， development and morphogenesis. Differentially methylated genes were enriched in differentially expressed genes. Thus， epigenetic variation is subject to selection and may play an important role in the adaptive response of populations in rapidly changing natural environments.,Genomic DNA was extracted from whole-plant above-ground tissue of individual 25-day-old plants with the Qiagen DNeasy kit (Qiagen). DNA from four randomly chosen individuals was pooled from selected (S2) lines that had experienced 5 generations of selection in the three replicated dynamic landscapes (D1， D5， D6) and from the ancestrals (A2) for both CVL39 and CVL125 respectively， yielding eight samples for bisulfite sequencing. DNA was treated with bisulfite which converts unmethylated cytosines to thymines but leaves methylated cytosines unconverted. DNA was then sequenced using the SOLIDTM Life technologiesTM System. DNA cytosine methylation profiles of selected lines (S2) were compared to methylation profiles from ancestral (A2) lines.,30361538,Nat Commun
Next generation sequencing based analysis of the embryonic (E15.5) transcriptome of wild type and Î²1-integrin-cKO lenses,GSE77188,Mus musculus,Î²1-integrin is the major Î²-integrin subunit expressed in both lens epithelial and fiber cells. Our previous research indicated that Î²1-integrin is essential for the maintenance of lens epithelial integrity and survival in late embryonic lens development (Simirskii et al， 2009). Lack of Î²1-integrin in the lens will lead to severe micropthalmia and lack of lens in adult mice. In order to study the mechanisms involved， high throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed to determine the genes that are differentially expressed between  E15.5 wild type (WT) lenses and lenses that lack Î²1-integrin expression due to the action of MLR10 CRE (Î²1-cKO). The methodology used here is similar to the other RNAseq experiments that were previously performed in our lab (Manthey et al.， 2014a and Audette et al， 2015) (Geo accession: GSE 49949 and GSE69940) . Meanwhile， the filtering criteria and processing procedures were also published (Manthey et al.， 2014b).  Compared to WT， 120 genes were found to be differentially expressed in Î²1-cKO lenses. Moreover， bioinformatics tools (DAVID (the database for Annotation， Visulization and Integrated Discovery)， and PANTHER (Protein Analysis through Evolutionary Relationship) classification system) as well as manual literature searching was applied for further data analysis. It showed that genes involved in EMT and stress-responses were differentially expressed in Î²1-cKO compared to that of WT.   Description of filtering criteria:  To identify the differentially expressed genes， pair-wise qCML method exact tests with a Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate correction greater than the threshold of P<0.05 was applied， which identified 5120 genes. As previously described (Manthey et al.， 2014b)， most of the genes differentially expressed between inbred C57Bl/6 <har> and mice with a mixed background were below a threshold of 2.5 fold change. Therefore， all differentially expressed genes with a less than 2.5 fold change were filtered out. Further， genes whose expression level were not high enough to be biologically significant were also filtered out， based on the RPMK (Reads per Kilobase per million reads) value. Any gene in the final list has RPKM greater that 2 in either WT or Î²1-cKO samples， a value that corresponds to approximately 1 mRNA molecule per cell. By applying a combination of these filtering criteria， 120 differentially expressed genes were found， which could potentially elucidate the molecular connections between conditional deletion of Î²1-intergrin from the lens and the observed phenotypic abnormalities.

Methods: Roots of two-half leaf seedlings of 9L136 and 93-11 were  sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 Sequencer; high-quality paired-end reads were mapped to the Nipponbare reference genome (MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Release 7) using the spliced read mapper TopHat version 2.0.12， and Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined based on a threshold of 2-fold expression change and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 using Cuffdiff， one module of Cufflinks. qRT-PCR analysis were performed using SYBR Green Master Mix on  CFX96 Real Time System. Results: 1388 genes which specifically differentilly expressed in 9L136 under salt stress were identified， and expression profile of 18 genes randomely selected was confirmed by qRT-PCR.,RNA-seq data of roots of two half-leaf seedlings under salt treatment and control condition were generated using Illumina HiSeq2500 Sequencer， in triplicate for each sample.,28861103,Front Plant Sci
Dynamic and static maintenance of epigenetic memory in pluripotent and somatic cells [mouse],GSE54959,Mus musculus,Stable maintenance of gene regulatory programs is essential for normal function in multi-cellular organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms， and DNA methylation in particular， are hypothesized to facilitate such maintenance by creating cellular memory that can be written during embryonic development and then guide cell-type specific gene expression. Here we use new methods to study distributions of DNA methylation patterns within cell populations to show that embryonic stem cells preserve their epigenetic state by balancing antagonistic processes that add and remove methylation marks rather than by copying epigenetic information from mother to daughter cells. Quantitative tuning of this equilibrium leads to convergence into a binary epigenetic configuration maintaining a sharp distinction between methylated and unmethylated regions. In contrast， somatic cells transmit considerable epigenetic information from mother to daughter cell. Paradoxically， the persistence of the somatic epigenome makes it more vulnerable to noise， since random epi-mutations can be preserved and accumulate to massively perturb the binary epigenomic ground state. Epigenetic perturbation is not observed in the pluripotent state， since the rapid turnover-based equilibrium continuously reinforces the canonical state. This dynamic epigenetic equilibrium also explains how the somatic epigenome can be reprogrammed quickly and accurately following induced pluripotency.,Comparison of single cell clonal population DNA methylation variation to the original population in primary CD8,25043040,Nature

OCT4 and SOX2 Work as Transcriptional Activators in Reprogramming Human Fibroblasts,GSE81899,Homo sapiens,SOX2 and OCT4， in conjunction with KLF4 and cMYC， are sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)， but it is unclear if they function as transcriptional activators or as repressors. We now show that， like OCT4， SOX2 functions as a transcriptional activator. We substituted SOX2-VP16 (a strong activator) for wild-type (WT) SOX2， and we saw an increase in the efficiency and rate of reprogramming， whereas the SOX2-HP1 fusion (a strong repressor) eliminated reprogramming. We report that， at an early stage of reprogramming， virtually all DNA-bound OCT4， SOX2， and SOX2-VP16 were embedded in putative enhancers， about half of which were created de novo. Those associated with SOX2-VP16 were， on average， stronger than those bearing WT SOX2. Many newly created putative enhancers were transient， and many transcription factor locations on DNA changed as reprogramming progressed. These results are consistent with the idea that， during reprogramming， there is an intermediate state that is distinct from both parental cells and iPSCs,We ectopically expressed， in human fibroblasts， proteins comprising either a strong activating Â (VP16) or a repressing region (HP1) fused to each of the factors- OCT4， SOX2， KLF4 and cMYC (OSKM). Â Â SOX2-VP16， in combination with the WT forms of the other three proteins， uniquely increased the efficiency of reprogramming， especially of cells taken from older (37-96 year old) donors. The mix evoked early (by day 5)， and strong， expression of critical pluripotency genes (e.g. NANOG)， and diminished the requirement for cMYC . Many pre-existing âactiveâ enhancers were attenuated， and a smaller number of new enhancers， especially at sites of OCT4， SOX2 and SOX2-VP16 binding， were created by day 5. Â The activities of newÂ enhancers created by SOX2-VP16 bindingÂ were generally greater than thoseÂ created by WT SOX2. Thus SOX2 and OCT4 work as activators capable of creating new enhancers， and increasing the activating function of SOX2 increases the activities of the new enhancers and theÂ efficiencies of reprogramming.,28813671,Cell Rep

A Ribonuclease Coordinates siRNA Amplification and mRNA Cleavage during RNAi,GSE59300,Caenorhabditis elegans,Effective silencing by RNA-interference (RNAi) depends on mechanisms that amplify and propagate the silencing signal. In some organisms， small-interfering (si) RNAs are amplified from target mRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Both RdRP recruitment and mRNA silencing require Argonaute proteins， which are generally thought to degrade RNAi targets by directly cleaving them. However in C. elegans， the enzymatic activity of the primary Argonaute， RDE-1， is not required for silencing activity.   We show that RDE-1 can instead recruit an endoribonuclease， RDE-8， to target RNA. RDE-8 can cleave RNA in vitro and is needed for the production of 3â² uridylated fragments of target mRNA in vivo.  We also find that RDE-8 promotes RdRP activity， thereby ensuring amplification of siRNAs.  Together， our findings suggest a model in which RDE-8 cleaves target mRNAs to mediate silencing， while generating 3â uridylated mRNA fragments to serve as templates for the RdRP-directed amplification of the silencing signal.,We examined the role of rde-8 in C. elegans small RNA biogenesis pathways， including endogenous and exogenous RNAi pathways. We performed 3' RACE seq from the sel-1 target mRNA and correlate with small RNAs from wild type， rde-8 and rde-8 transgenic strains after sel-1(RNAi) for different lengths of time.,25635455,Cell

A Highly Conserved GAD-1 Is Required for Pre-mRNA Splicing and Transcription Elongation by Forming Spliceosome with NineTeen Complex,GSE94463,Caenorhabditis elegans,Pre-mRNA splicing requires assembly of spliceosome that consists of hundreds of factors forming various dynamic complexes with or without small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Systematic identification of the splicing factors remains a significant challenge especiallyÂ in vivo. In our genetic screening for the factors required for division asynchrony duringÂ CaenorhabditisÂ elegansÂ embryogenesis， we identifiedÂ a highly conserved but uncharacterized essential protein， GAD-1， that is necessary for setting cell cycle length of intestine progenitors， a function that is shared with many other factors involved in transcription， pre-mRNA splicing or polyadenylation， suggesting its potential role in mRNA biogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry reveals that GAD-1 mainly interacts with non-snRNP type of splicing complex called NineTeen Complex (NTC). Consistent with this， RNA-seq analysis demonstrates pervasive defects in pre-mRNA splicing inÂ gad-1Â mutants. Transgenic reporter assayÂ shows its ubiquitous and nuclear expression across developmental stages. Immunostaining of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II demonstrates a GAD-1âs role in transcription elongation. In agreement with this， depletion of GAD-1 and its interacting partners inhibits expression of both ubiquitous and tissue-specific genes， supporting that both GAD-1 and many of its interacting proteins are novel components of NTC or its associated spliceosome. Taken together， we identify GAD-1 and its multiple interacting partners as novel components of spliceosomeÂ in vivoÂ through which they regulate pre-mRNA splicing and transcription elongation.Â,Mix-stage embryo samples were collected from strain BW1943 (gad-1(ct226) dpy-11(e224) V) at 16 Â°C and 25 Â°C by bleaching.

RNA-seq Analysis of the Salt Stress Induced Transcripts in Fast Growing Bioenergy Tree， Paulownia elongata,GSE94501,Paulownia elongata,Paulownia elongata is a fast-growing tree species native to China that is grown in different climates， types of soils， and can be easily re-grown. The versatility of the P. elongata species makes it an ideal candidate for biofuel production. High soil salinity is known to inhibit plant growth dramatically or lead to death. Salinity in soil is a detrimental abiotic stress affecting crop production worldwide and a hindrance for potential crop candidates used for biofuel production. The purpose of this study was to characterize the salt-induced transcriptome of P. elongata. Transcriptome differences in response to salt stress were determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 646 genes were found to have significant altered expression in response to salt stress， and expression levels of a selective subset of these genes were chosen and confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first report of salt-induced transcriptome analysis in P. elongata. The current study indicates that the differential expression of certain genes may have an important role in the adaptation of P. elongata in response to salt stress. Functional characterization of these genes will assist in future development of salt tolerance in P. elongata， which could be used to enhance biofuel production.,Transcriptomes of 3-year old Paulownia elongata pots wild type (WT) and salt stressed (SS) by next generation sequencing， in duplicate using Illumina MiSeq,nan,
Early-life gene expression in neurons modulates lasting epigenetic states. [RNA-seq 2],GSE104325,Mus musculus,In mammals during the early postnatal period the environment plays a critical role in promoting the final steps in neuronal development. While epigenetic factors are thought to contribute to this process， the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that in the brain during early life the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A transiently binds across transcribed regions of lowly expressed genes， and its binding specifies the pattern of DNA methylation at CA sequences (mCA) within these genes. We find that DNMT3A occupancy and mCA deposition within the transcribed regions of genes is negatively regulated by gene transcription and may be modified by early-life experience. Once deposited， mCA is bound by the methyl-DNA-binding protein MECP2 and functions in a rheostat-like manner to fine-tune the cell type-specific transcription of genes that are critical for brain function.,RNA-seq from mouse brain tissue and neurons,29056337,Cell
RNA sequencing identifies differentially expressed genes in embryonic cardiomyocytes following knockdown of DNMT3a or DNMT3b expression,GSE77514,Mus musculus,Purpose: This study aims to identify the differentially expressed genes in embryonic cardiomyocytes following the knockdown of DNMT3a or DNMT3b expression. Methods: Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from mouse embryonic day (E) 13.5 ventricles， and cultured for 48 h at 37Â°C to reach 70-80% confluency. Cells were transfected with either Qiagen FlexiTube GeneSolution (with 4 siRNAs) DNMT3a siRNA (#GS13435)， DNMT3b siRNAs (#GS13436)， or AllStars negative control siRNA (#1027281) at 0.012 pmol using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (n=3 per treatment). At 72 h after transfection， cells were released with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies， San Diego， CA) and dissociated with Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies). To sort cardiomyocytes， dissociated cells were stained with anti-VCAM1 antibody conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC; BioLegend， San Diego， CA) and magnetically sorted using anti-APC microbeads and magnetic assisted cell sorting (MACS) columns (Miltenyi Biotec， Bergisch Gladbach， Germany). Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cardiomyocytes with the RNAqueousÂ®-Micro Total RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific， Waltham， MA). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared with the NEBNextÂ® mRNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB， Ipswich， MA). The nine Illumina-adapted libraries were pooled at equal molar ratio and sequenced with one High Output 1x75 cycles run on a NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina). The fastq files generated from RNA-Seq were uploaded to the UF Research Computing Galaxy instance developed by the University of Florida. The data were cleaned with the following steps: removed sequencing artifacts， trimmed 5â or 3â ends with low scores， removed adaptor contamination， and filtered low quality reads by the FastQC program. The remaining high quality RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) with the Tophat2 tool. Counting of RNA-seq reads were performed with HTSeq. Differential expression (DE) of genes between treatments was analyzed using two methods: R packages EdgeR and DEseq2， with Ensembl Mus_GRCm38.79.gtf as the reference annotation. Genes with false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 and absolute fold change greater than 1.5 were considered as significant. Unique DE genes were identified by combining the results generated from the two analytical methods. Results: DE analysis by DEseq2 and EdgeR software revealed that 524 genes were up-regulated， and 586 genes were down-regulated after knockdown of DNMT3a expression for 72 h. With the same analytical methods and criteria， the results of DE analysis showed that the knockdown of DNMT3b increased the expression of 655 genes and decreased the expression of 378 genes.,mRNA profiles in embryonic cardiomyocytes with knockdown of DNMT3a or DNMT3b expression were generated by deep sequencing (n=3 for negative siRNA， n=3 for DNMT3a siRNA， n=3 for DNMT3b siRNA)， using Illumina NextSeq500.,27306334,FASEB J

Since Arid3a shows the highest expression in placenta， we hypothesized that Arid3a may play important roles in TE development. We report that Arid3a is a central regulator of both TE-specific and pluripotency-associated gene expression during ES cell differentiation. While dispensable for self-renewal， we observed that knockdown of Arid3a delays differentiation of ES cells. Induction of Arid3a leads ES cells to promote differentiation， specifically towards TE lineage. Moreover， these Arid3a-overexpressing cells maintained in TE culture media are sufficient to generate functional trophoblast stem-like cells， suggesting roles of Arid3a in TE differentiation. By integrative analyses using the chromosomal targets of Arid3a with expression profiling， we revealed the dual roles of Arid3a， as a direct activator of TE-specific genes and a repressor of pluripotency-associated genes. We further revealed the repressive roles of Arid3a are mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Taken together， our results demonstrate that Arid3a is a critical novel regulator in TE lineage specification.,Arid3a ChIP was performed using bioChIP-sequencing. Control ChIP-sequencing was performed using BirA cells. HDAC1 ChIP was performed as native antibody ChIP-sequencing.,25319825,Genes Dev
Functional characterization of the RNA chaperone Hfq in opportunistic human pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,GSE39705,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an important opportunistic pathogen affecting primarily hospitalized and immuno-compromised hosts. We constructed an hfq deletion mutant (Delta-hfq) of S. maltophilia， and compared the behaviour of wild-type and Delta-hfq S. maltophilia cells in a variety of assays. Differential RNA sequencing analysis (dRNA-seq) of RNA isolated from S. maltophilia wild-type and Delta-hfq strains showed that Hfq regulates expression of genes encoding flagellar and fimbrial components， transmembrane proteins， as well as enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways. Moreover， we analysed expression of several sRNAs identified by dRNA-seq in wild-type. The accumulation of two sRNAs was strongly reduced in the absence of Hfq.,TEX (terminator exonuclease) treated and untreated libraries of the wild type and the Delta-hfq mutant were sequenced and compared,22923593,J Bacteriol
Comparison of gene expression by RNA-seq in canine gonads from embryos at risk of XX Disorder of Sex Development (XX)， male (XY) littermate controls， and age-matched female (XX) and male (XY) controls.,GSE92283,Canis lupus familiaris,In a rare subtype of XX Disorder of Sex Development (DSD)， individuals are negative for SRY， the testis determining factor on the Y chromosome， yet develop testes or ovotestes， and both of these phenotypes occur in the same family. This is a naturally occurring disorder in humans (Homo sapiens) and dogs (C. familiaris)， and phenotypes in the canine XX DSD model are strikingly similar to those in this type of human XX DSD. The purposes of this study were to identify 1) a variant associated with XX DSD in the canine model and 2) gene expression alterations in canine embryonic gonads that could be informative to causation. Using a genome wide association study (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)， we identified a variant on C. familiaris autosome 9 (CFA9) that is significantly associated with XX DSD in the canine model and in affected purebred dogs. This is the first marker and candidate causative variant identified for inherited canine XX DSD. It lies within the canine ortholog for the human disorder (OMIM 278850)， which resides on 17q24， upstream of SOX9. Gene expression studies (RNA-seq and PRO-seq) in embryonic gonads at risk of XX DSD from the canine model identified significant RSPO1 downregulation in comparison to XX controls， without significant upregulation of SOX9 or other known testis pathway genes. A novel mechanism is proposed in which the canine XX DSD variant acts upstream of RSPO1 to induce epigenomic gonadal mosaicism.,Total of 55 samples analyzed from several gestational ages: 1) One sample (XX d34 control female) was total RNA from pooled gonad pairs of 6 female canine embryos (breed: Beagle/Labrador retriever mix， A1056， A1057， A1060， A1063， A1067， A1068). 2) One sample (XY d34 control male) was total RNA from pooled gonad pairs of 7 male canine embryos (breed: Beagle/Labrador retriever mix， A1055， A1058， A1059， A1061， A1064， A1065， A1066). 3) For the remaining 53 samples (d35-44)， a barcoded cDNA library was prepared from total RNA of a gonad pair from one embryo. Barcoded libraries were pooled for sequencing according to group [XX DSD at risk (C# XX DSD)， XY littermate control (C# XY)， XX age-matched control (XX A#)， XY age-matched control (XY A#)]. Sequence output was sorted by barcode to generate one transcriptome per gonad pair.,29053721,PLoS One
CACUL1 reciprocally regulates SIRT1 and LSD1 to repress PPARÎ³ and inhibit adipogenesis,GSE105055,Mus musculus,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) is the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and is closely linked to the development of obesity. Despite a large progress on the transcriptional network of PPARÎ³， the epigenetic regulation associated with histone modification remains elusive. Here， we found that CDK2-associated cullin 1 (CACUL1)， identified as a novel SIRT1 interacting protein， directly binds to PPARÎ³ through the CoRNR box 2 and represses the transcription activity and adipogenic potential of PPARÎ³. Upon CACUL1 depletion， less SIRT1 and more LSD1 was recruited to the PPARÎ³-responsive gene promoter， leading to the increased histone H3K9 acetylation and decreased H3K9 methylation for PPARÎ³ activation during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. These findings were reversed upon fasting or resveratrol treatment. Further， gene expression profiling using RNA-seq supported the repressive role of CACUL1 in PPARÎ³ activation and fat accumulation. Finally， we confirmed the CACUL1 function in human adipose-derived stem cells. Overall， our data suggest that    CACUL1 tightly regulates PPARÎ³ signaling through the mutual opposition between SIRT1 and LSD1， providing additional insight into its use for anti-obesity treatment.,mRNA profiles of 3T3-L1 cells， which are stably expressing Flag-emtpy， Flag-CACUL1， sh-Luciferase or sh-CACUL1， were generated by RNA-seq after adipogenesis for 8 days,29233982,Cell Death Dis
Dissecting immune circuits by linking CRISPR pooled screens with single cell RNA-seq [SET1],GSE90486,Mus musculus,In multicellular organisms， dedicated regulatory circuits control cell-type diversity and response. The crosstalk and redundancies within these circuits and substantial cellular heterogeneity pose a major research challenge. We present CRISP-seq， an integrated method for massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq and CRISPR pooled screens. We show that profiling the perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell， enables to elucidate， the function of multiple factors and their interactions. In this benchmarking study， we applied this technology to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice， we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors controlling the commitment toward different cell lineages or the inflammatory and antiviral pathways. CRISP-seq thereby emerges as a broadly applicable， comprehensive， and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits.,Transcriptional and CRISPR profiles from single myeloid cells， infected with lentiviral vectors carrying different gRNAs， were generated by deep sequencing of tens of thousands of single cells， sequenced in several batches in an Illumina Nextseq 500.Experiment was paired-end， but read2 was used to read cell and molecule barcodes only.Additional details about experimental design (associating each single cell with its amplification batch and index sorting readout) available as Series supplementary file.,27984734,Cell
Studying the mating mechanisms in Phytophthora infestans,GSE94137,Phytophthora infestans,Phytophthora infestans is a filamentous plant pathogen. It belongs to the class Oomycota within the Stramenopiles. Despite the importance of sexual reproduction in P. infestans， many aspects of the mating process remain unknown. In this study we are investigating its mating mechanisms using different molecular techniques. Isolates with A1 and A2 mating types from Sweden， the Netherlands and the UK， were used for this purpose because mating frequencies are known to differ among European countries. RNA was prepared from the âmating-zoneâ between the 4 Swedish， 1 Dutch and 1 British pairs. RNA-seq analysis was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and data normalized to parental isolates growing individually.,In total 14 samples were analyzed. The mating samples (m3-m10) contained 3 biological replicates， while the control samples (s1-s8) contained 2 biological replicates,32153537,Front Microbiol

Transcriptional reprogramming underpins enhanced plant growth promotion by the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma hamatum GD12 during antagonistic interactions with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in soil,GSE67909,Sclerotinia sclerotiorum;Trichoderma hamatum GD12,The free-living soil fungus Trichoderma hamatum GD12 is notable amongst other Trichoderma strains in exhibiting both biocontrol and plant growth promotion (PGP) activities， which are coincident with a markedly expanded genome when compared to other characterised biocontrol and PGP isolates. Here， we make direct comparisons of T. hamatum GD12 transcription during PGP， and during antagonism of the root-infecting pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum， in peat-based microcosms. An extensive mRNA-seq analysis sampling six time-points， 1， 2， 4， 7， 10 and 15 days after microcosm establishment revealed dynamic and biphasic signatures in the transcriptional responses of T. hamatum GD12 during Sclerotinia biocontrol and lettuce growth promotion. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes demonstrated up-regulation of transportation and oxidation-reduction genes during both processes. Sclerotinia biocontrol is most likely mediated by the synthesis and secretion of antifungal compounds. Notably， the biphasic response during biocontrol was further characterised by the expression of a number of uncharacterised GD12 genes， small-secreted cysteine rich proteins and secondary metabolite producing gene clusters. This work demonstrates that T. hamatum GD12 harnesses a reservoir of uncharacterised genes that are actively engaged during effective biological control of a plurivorous plant pathogen.,RNA extracted directly from soil containing lettuce seedlings with either Trichoderma hamatum GD12 alone， T.hamatum GD12 and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum， or S. sclerotiorum alone. RNA was extracted in triplicate at days one， two， four， seven， ten and fifteen and then sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500. Two samples were taken in duplicate due to issues with RNA extraction.,27187266,Mol Plant Pathol
Integrating Genomics， Transcriptomics， and T-Cell Biology: An RNA-seq Atlas of the Murine CD4+ Transcriptome,GSE31555,Mus musculus,CD4+ cells are key regulators of the adaptive immune system and can be classified into two main groups: T helper cells (naive， Th1， Th2 and Th17 cells)， and regulatory T cells， iTreg and nTreg cells). We performed mRNA-sequencing on these major CD4+ cell subtypes， and integrated multiple computational methods for analyzing gene/isoform expression， differential expression， and functional annotation. Our primary analysis not only provides evidence for the very high quality of the sequence data， but also reveals novel patterns of read distributions inside and adjacent to genes. We identify 168 novel transcripts， which are differentially expressed in the various CD4+ cell subtypes. Further， we identify a wealth of novel， uniquely differentially expressed 'signature' transcripts for each cell type.  nTreg  cells have the largest number of these， with 477 signature genes in total， of which 58 are transcription factors.

Transcriptome profile of a murine renal bilateral ischemia reperfusion model 2 hours to 12 months post injury,GSE98622,Mus musculus,Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). To extend our understanding of renal repair， and its limits， we performed a detailed molecular characterization of a murine ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) model for 12 months post injury. RNA-seq analysis highlights a cascade of temporal specific gene expression patterns related to tubular injury/repair， fibrosis， innate and adaptive immunity.,Murine renal bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) was performed on 10- to 12-week-old (25- 28g) C57Bl/6NCrl male mice (Charles River). The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine mix (105 mg ketamine/kg; 10 mg xylazine/kg). The body temperature was maintained at 36.5~ 37Â°C throughout the procedure. Kidneys were exposed by a midline abdominal incision and both renal pedicles were clamped for 21 min using non-traumatic microaneurysm clips. Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure except for clamping of the pedicles.  Cohorts of 3 to 4 biological replicates for injured， sham and uninjured kidneys were collected for RNA-seq at 10 different time points following IRI: 2， 4 hours; 1， 2， 3 days; 1， 2， 4 weeks; and 6， 12 months.,28931758,JCI Insight

Loss of Sip1 leads to migration defects and retention of ectodermal markers during lens development,GSE49949,Mus musculus,We report the application of  RNA-sequencing technology for the high-throughput profiling of mammalian lens gene expression at embryonic day 15.5.  The lens has a particularly biased transcriptome， with the top 50 genes encoding approximately 90% of the protein content.  Using RNA-Seq， we have shown that there are over 7，700 genes being expressed in the lens at embryonic day 15.5.  As expected， the crystallins and many structural genes were amoung the most highly expressed; however， numerous genes expressed at lower transcript abundance were also identified.  This study provides a framework for the application of RNA-Seq technology towards characterization of the mammalian lens transcriptome during development.Using high-throughput RNA-sequencing， gene expression in the mammalian lens was compared between an inbred C56Bl/6<har> strain and a mix background strain at E15.5.  This analysis identifies almost 2，000 genes being differentially expressed between the inbred and mixed background lenses， ranging from 6.5 fold upregulated to 5.2 fold downregulated in the mixed background compared to the inbred strain.  This list does not include unknown/predicted genes or pseudogenes which are known to change between strains.  Further， it appears that approximately 98% of these genes are altered at levels less than 2.5 fold.  This study therefore provides a fold change threshold cutoff (2.5 fold) to use in the analysis of differentially expressed lens genes at E15.5 using RNA-Seq technology as it takes into account genetic variation due to background strain differences.SIP1 encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates multiple developmental processes as highlighted by the pleiotropic defects observed in Mowat-Wilson Syndrome， which results from mutations in this gene.  Further， in adults， dysregulated SIP1 expression has been implicated in both cancer and fibrotic diseases where it functionally links TGFb signaling to the loss of epithelial preferred gene expression.  In the ocular lens， an epithelial tissue important for vision， Sip1 is co-expressed with epithelial markers such as E-cadherin， and is required for the complete separation of the lens vesicle from the head ectoderm during early ocular morphogenesis.  However， the function of Sip1 after early lens morphogenesis is still unknown.   Here， we conditionally deleted Sip1 from the developing mouse lens shortly after lens vesicle closure， leading to defects in coordinated fiber cell tip migration， defective suture formation and cataract.  Interestingly， RNA-Sequencing analysis on Sip1 knockout lenses identified 190 differentially expressed genes， all of which are distinct from previously described Sip1 target genes involved in EMT/cancer.  Furthermore， 34% of the upregulated genes in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally downregulated as the lens transitions from the lens vesicle to early lens， while 49% of the genes downregulated in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally upregulated during early lens development.  Overall， these data imply that Sip1 plays a major role in reprogramming the lens vesicle away from a surface ectoderm cell fate towards that necessary for the development of a transparent lens and demonstrate that Sip1 regulates distinctly different sets of genes in different cellular contexts.,RNA-Seq of inbred background wild type lenses at E15.5RNA-Seq comparison of mixed background wild type controls and inbred wild type (C57Bl/6<har>) lenses at E15.5RNA-Seq comparison of mixed background wild type controls and Sip1 conditional knockout lenses at E15.5,24161570,Mech Dev

Structural and mechanistic insights into ATRX-dependent and âindependent functions of the histone chaperone DAXX [RNA-seq],GSE102688,Mus musculus,The histone variant H3.3 is incorporated in a replication-independent manner at heterochromatic regions by the ATRX-DAXX histone chaperone complex. Here， we present a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of an interaction surface between ATRX and DAXX.  We used single amino acid substitutions in DAXX that abrogate formation of the complex to explore ATRX-dependent and -independent functions of DAXX. We found that Â the repression of specific murine endogenous retroviruses is dependent on DAXX， but not on ATRX. In support， we reveal the existence of two biochemically distinct DAXX-containing complexes: The ATRX-DAXX complex involved in gene repression and telomere chromatin structure， and a DAXX-SETDB1-KAP1-HDAC1 complex that represses endogenous retroviruses independently of ATRX and H3.3 incorporation into chromatin.  We found that histone H3.3 stabilizes DAXX protein levels and affects DAXX-regulated genes independently of its incorporation into nucleosomes.  Our findings represent the first description of a nucleosome-independent function for the H3.3 histone variant.,RNA-seq analysis of five embryonic stem cell lines in duplicate (Daxx-/- mESC， Daxx-/- mESC rescued with Daxx WT， H3.3 KO mESC， H3.3 KO mESC rescued with H3.3 WT and H3.3 L126A-L130A  mutant),29084956,Nat Commun

Pharyngeal mesoderm regulatory network controls cardiac and head muscle morphogenesis,GSE42389,Mus musculus,The search for developmental mechanisms driving vertebrate organogenesis has paved the way toward a deeper understanding of birth defects. During embryogenesis， parts of the heart and craniofacial muscles arise from pharyngeal mesoderm (PM) progenitors. Here， we reveal a hierarchical regulatory network of a set of transcription factors expressed in the PM that initiates heart and craniofacial organogenesis. Genetic perturbation of this network in mice resulted in heart and craniofacial muscle defects， revealing robust cross-regulation between its members. We identified Lhx2 as a novel player during cardiac and pharyngeal muscle development. Lhx2 and Tcf21 genetically interact with Tbx1， the major determinant in the etiology of DiGeorge/velo-cardio-facial/22q11.2 deletion syndrome.  Furthermore， knockout of these genes in the mouse recapitulates specific cardiac features of this syndrome. We suggest that PM-derived cardiogenesis and myogenesis are network properties rather than properties specific to individual PM members. These findings shed new light on the developmental underpinnings of congenital defects.,Mouse embryos were selected at E9.5， 10.5 and 11.5. We used Myf5Cre;RosaYFP in order to label all the myogenic lineage. Trunk (T) and Head (H) tissues were isolated， dispersed into a single cell suspension and FACS sorted for YFP+ population. Further analysis is described in Harel et al， PNAS (2012).,23112163,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

A comprehensive assessment of RNA-seq accuracy， reproducibility and information content by the Sequence Quality Control consortium,GSE47774,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct,We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project， coordinated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Examining Illumina HiSeq， Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls， we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for sequence discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths， we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions， with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used.

RNA sequencing identifies differentially expressed genes in adult left ventricles following in utero caffeine exposure during embryonic day 6.5-9.5,GSE79013,Mus musculus,Purpose: This study aims to identify the differentially expressed genes in adult left ventricles treated with caffeine during early embryogenesis. Methods: Pregnant CD-1 mice were treated with vehicle (normal saline) or 20 mg/kg caffeine via i.p. injection once daily during embryonic day (E) 6.5-9.5. Pups were born and raised to one year of age. Left ventricles from adult male mice were dissected and used for total RNA isolation with the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Valencia， CA， USA). mRNA was isolated from total RNA using NEXTflexâ¢ Poly(A) Beads (Bioo Scientific， Austin， TX， USA). Sequencing libraries were prepared with the NEBNextÂ® mRNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina (NEB， Ipswich， MA， USA) and the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB). Illumina-adapted libraries (n=3/treatment) were pooled at equal molar ratio and sequenced with one High Output 1x75 cycles run on a NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina， San Diego， CA， USA). The fastq files generated from RNA-Seq were uploaded to the UF Research Computing Galaxy instance developed by the University of Florida. The data were cleaned with the following steps: removed sequencing artifacts， trimmed 5â or 3â ends with low scores， removed adaptor contamination， and filtered low quality reads by the FastQC program. The remaining high quality RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) with the Tophat2 tool. Counting of RNA-Seq reads were performed with HTSeq. Differential expression (DE) of genes between treatments was analyzed using R package EdgeR， with Ensembl Mus_GRCm38.79.gtf as the reference annotation. Genes with false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 and absolute fold change greater than 1.5 were considered as significant. Results: DE analysis revealed that 85 genes were up-regulated， and 31 genes were down-regulated in the adult left ventricles treated with in utero caffeine.,mRNA expression profiles in the adult left ventricles treated with vehicle or 20 mg/kg caffeine during E6.5-9.5 were generated by deep sequencing (n=3/treatment)， using Illumina NextSeq500.,27677355,Sci Rep
Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901， a shift from a H2-excess condition to a H2-limiting condition,GSE42143,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
ERF deletion rescues RAS deficiency in mouse embryonic stem cells [ChIP-seq],GSE99476,Mus musculus,RAS proteins are key regulators of growth factor signaling. Here we show that deletion of all RAS genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) leads to an overall reduction in protein translation， limits their long-term proliferative capacity and incapacitates them to differentiate. Deletion of ERF， a transcriptional repressor of the ETS family， rescues proliferation and differentiation of RAS-deficient mES cells and allows the development of teratomas lacking RAS genes. Upon RAS deletion， ERF translocates to the nucleus where it binds to multiple enhancers of key RAS targets suppressing their expression. We also reveal recurrent losses of ERF in cancer and show that ERF deficiency increases the resistance of cancer cells to pharmacological inhibition of the RAS pathway. In summary， we here reveal a central role for ERF in coordinating RAS signaling in pluripotent cells， and identify a synthetic viable interaction that bypasses the requirement for RAS proteins in mammalian cells.,We performed ChIP-seq analysis by pulling down ERF-bound genomic sequences in untreated and OHT-treated H-Rasâ/â; N-Rasâ/â; K-Raslox/lox; RERTert/ert ES cells. In the untreated condition ERF remains out of the nuclei by ERK-dependent phosphorylation， whereas ERF goes to the nuclei and bound its targets in the OHT-treated cells due to the absence of MAPK pathway signaling.,29650524,Genes Dev
Network-based， cross-cohort discovery of transcriptional mechanisms presiding over maintenance of high-risk neuroblastoma subtype state,GSE84389,Homo sapiens,Network-based analysis of neuroblastoma samples from two large cohorts identified master regulator proteins controlling the transcriptional state of three high-risk molecular subtypes. In particular， a TEAD4-MYCN positive feedback loop emerged as the core regulatory motif of a small protein module presiding over implementation and stability of the subtype associated with MYCN amplification. Specifically， MYCN transcriptionally activates TEAD4， which in turn activates MYCN both transcriptionally and post-translationally. The resulting MYCN-TEAD4 positive feedback loop plays a critical role in maintaining aberrant activity of a 10-protein regulatory module that causally regulates the transcriptional state of this subtype. Consistently， loss of TEAD4 activity induces core module activity collapse and abrogates neuroblastoma cell viability in vitro and in vivo， thus suggesting novel therapeutic strategies for this important childhood cancer.,Study of the transcriptional control by TEAD4 and MYCN positive feedback loop using RNA-seq profiles of TEAD4， WWTR1 and MYCN shRNA knockdowns in neuroblastoma BE2 cells.

Transcriptomics and Real-Time PCR analysis reveals a cross-modulatory effect between riboflavin and iron and outlines common and specific responses to riboflavin biosynthesis and uptake in Vibrio cholerae,GSE107538,Vibrio cholerae,Riboflavin-derived molecules such as flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide comprise the most important redox coenzymes all across life kingdoms. Vibrio cholerae， a pandemic diarrheagenic bacterium， is able to synthesize riboflavin through the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (RBP) and to internalize exogenous riboflavin using the RibN importer. This bacterium thrives in different environments such as estuarine waters and the human intestinal tract. The presence of two independent riboflavin supply pathways in this species may be related to the variable riboflavin availability and requirements across different niches. In order to gain insights into the role of the riboflavin provision pathways in the physiology of V. cholerae， we analyzed the bacterial transcriptomics response to extracellular riboflavin and to the deletions of ribD (RBP-deficient strain) or ribN. Notably， many genes responding to riboflavin have been previously reported to belong to the iron regulon. Real time PCR analysis confirmed this effect and further documented that reciprocally， iron regulates RBP and ribN genes in a riboflavin-dependent way. A subset of genes were responding to both ribD and ribN deletions. Nonetheless， a group of genes was specifically affected in the âribD strain， on which the functional terms protein folding and oxidation reduction process were enriched. Also， a subset of genes was affected specifically in the âribN strain， on which the cytochrome complex assembly functional term was enriched.  Results indicate that iron and riboflavin interrelate to regulate its respective provision genes and suggest that both common and specific effects of biosynthesized and internalized riboflavin exist.,Strains and growth conditions. V. cholerae N16961 strain and its âribD and âribN derivatives were grown overnight in LB plates at 37 Â°C. 5 ml of LB broth were inoculated with a colony of the plate cultures and incubated at 37 Â°C in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm until they reached an OD600 nm of 1.0. Next， cultures were centrifuged and pellet washed twice with T minimal medium (Wyckoff and Payne， 2011) and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh T medium. 10 ml of plain T medium or T + 2 ÂµM riboflavin were inoculated with 10 Âµl of the resuspensions and incubated at 37 Â°C and 180 rpm until an OD600 nm of 0.8. 1 ml of each culture was centrifuged and subjected to RNA extraction. When indicated， iron was omitted in T media， in which case 3 ml of cultures at OD600 nm = 0.3 were harvested for RNA extraction. This growth protocol was similar for RNA subjected to transcriptomics and RT-PCR.RNA extractions， retrotranscription， RNAseq and RT-PCR. RNA extraction was performed with the Thermo Scientific Genejet RNA purification kit according to manufacturerÂ´s instructions. RNA extracts were digested with Turbo DNA-free DNAase at 37 Â°C for 1 hour. For RNAseq， rRNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero removal kit and cDNA libraries were constructed using the TruSeq mRNA stranded kit， according to manufacturerÂ´s instructions. Next， RNA was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to produce 100bp paired-end reads， with ~40 million reads (per sample).  rRNA removal， cDNA libraries generation and RNAseq were performed at Genoma Mayor (Santiago， Chile). For RT-PCR analysis， the AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies) was used for cDNA synthesis according to manufacturerÂ´s instructions. As a control， a reaction with no reverse transcriptase was included for each sample in each run. RT-PCR was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix kit in a One-Step Applen Biosystems (Life Technologies) thermocycler. Relative expression in the indicated conditions was determined through the ââCt method as developed before (Livak and Schmittgen， 2001). The 16s RNA subunit gene was used for normalization. For the assessment of the relative expression by RT-PCR of ribB， ribN， ribD and gyrB， the sets of primers used were ribB Fw/ribB Rv， ribN Fw/ribN Rv， ribD Fw/ribD Rv and gyrB Fw/gyrB Rv (Cisternas et al.， 2017)， respectively. Other RT-PCR primers are as follow: for tonB1， tonB1 Fw (5Â´- ggtgtttgccatgcctgctgg-3Â´) / tonB1 Rv (5Â´-GCGGCTTCACCTTCGGCTTAG-3Â´); for sodA， sodA Fw (5Â´-GCCAAGCGATATTCATCCAAGG-3Â´) / sodA Rv (5Â´-GCTCAGTGGCCTATCTTCATGC-3Â´).RNAseq data analysis. Quality control visualization and analysis (adapter and quality trimming) was performed using FastQC version 0.11.2 (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and Trim_galore version 0.4.1 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)， respectively. Reads were mapped to the genome of Vibrio cholerae 01 biovar El Tor str. N16961 (RefSeq， NCBI) using Bowtie2 version 2.1.0 (Langmead and Salzberg， 2012). In all the samples the alignment percentage of reads were above 98%. Differential expression analysis between samples was performed with the Bioconductor package edgeR version 3.18.1 (Robinson et al.， 2010) using negative binomial model and exact test based on quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood method (qCML). Genes with a statistically significant change in expression (P<0.05) were selected for further analysis. Analyses of enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms of biological processes in the indicated subsets of genes were performed on the online platform of the Gene Ontology Consortium (www.geneontology.org)， and statistically significant (P<0.05) functional terms were retrieved.This series contains only the RNA-seq data from wildtype， âribD and âribN strains grown in the presence or absence of riboflavin.,29453341,Sci Rep
SLFN11 blocks stressed replication forks independently of ATR,GSE101516,Homo sapiens,SLFN11 sensitizes cancer cells to a broad range of DNA-targeted therapies. Here we show that， in response to replication stress induced by camptothecin， SLFN11 tightly binds chromatin at stressed replication foci via RPA1 together with the replication helicase subunit MCM3. Unlike ATR， SLFN11 neither interferes with the loading of CDC45 and PCNA nor inhibits the initiation of DNA replication but selectively blocks fork progression while inducing chromatin opening across replication initiation sites. The ATPase domain of SLFN11 is required for chromatin opening， replication block and cell death but not for the tight binding of SLFN11 to chromatin. Replication stress by the CHK1 inhibitor Prexasertib also recruits SLFN11 to nascent replicating DNA together with CDC45 and PCNA. We conclude that SLFN11 is recruited to stressed replication forks carrying extended RPA filaments where it blocks replication by changing chromatin structure across replication sites.,Nascent strand abundance assay (Nascent strand DNA-seq; NS-seq)Replication origins were identified using the nascent-strand sequencing and abundance assay (Fu et al.， 2014; Martin et al.， 2011). In brief， twenty million of CCRF-CEM parental and SLFN11-del cells were treated with DMSO， CPT (100 nM)， or CPT (100 nM) and VE-821 (2 Î¼M) for four hours. DNA fractions (0.5-2 kb) were isolated using DNA fractionation on a 5-30% neutral sucrose gradient. 5â single strand DNA ends were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and then treated with lambda-exonuclease (NEB) to remove genomic DNA fragments that lacked the phosphorylated RNA primer. After RNase treatment， purified single stranded nascent DNA were random-primed using the Klenow and DNA Prime Labeling System (Invitrogen). Double-stranded nascent DNA (1 Î¼g) was sequenced using the Illumina genome analyzer II (Solexa).Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq)Genome-wide mapping of chromatin accessibility was done by following the published method (Buenrostro et al.， 2015). Briefly， fifty thousand CCRF-CEM parental and SLFN11-del cells were treated with DMSO or CPT (100 nM) for 2 and 4 hours. K562-Vector， -WT and âE669Q cells were treated with DMSO or CPT (1 Î¼M) for 4 hours. To prepare nuclei， cells were lysed using cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl， pH 7.4， 10 mM NaCl， 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). Immediately following the nuclei preparation， the pellet was re-suspended in the transposase reaction mix [25 Î¼l 2x TD buffer， 2.5 Î¼l Transposase (Illumina) and 22.5 Î¼l of nuclease free water]， and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 Â°C. Directly following transposition， the sample was purified using a DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 (ZYMO RESEARCH) and eluted with 25 Î¼l of DNA elution buffer. Following purification， we amplified library fragments using 1x NEBnext PCR master mix and 1.25 Î¼M of custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2， using the following PCR conditions: 72Â°C for 5 minutes， 98Â°C for 30 seconds， followed by thermo-cycling at 98Â°C for 10 seconds， 63Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 1 minute.

Genome-wide identification of Ikaros binding sites in primary pre-B cells,GSE42462,Mus musculus,Ikaros DNA binding proteins are important regulators of haematopoiesis and genetic deletion of Ikaros results in severe developmental disturbances， including delayed thymocyte differentiation and an early and complete block in B cell development. Although Ikaros ChIP-seq data are available for mouse thymocytes and human haematopoietic progenitors， it has not been achieved in B cell progenitors. The goal of this study was to identify Ikaros binding sites in pre-B cells to define Ikaros target genes which could explain the essential role of Ikaros proteins in B cell differentiation.,We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) with antibodies to the C-terminus of endogenous Ikaros in primary pre-B cells isolated from mouse fetal livers.,23303821,Blood
Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901:del_fruA (MMP1382)-del_frcA (MMP0820)， a shift from a H2-excess and P-limiting condition to a H2-limited and P-excess condition in chemostats (growth rate held constant),GSE42165,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. For shifts from P-limited to P-excess conditions， phosphate was raised from 0.13 mM to the standard 0.8 mM. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res

Transcriptional responses of inbred lines B73， B75 and B96 and resulting F1 lines to herbivory by Tetranychus urticae,GSE116496,Zea mays,The extreme generalist two-spotted spider mite， Tetranychus urticae， which is documented to feed on more than 1100 plant hosts， is becoming an increasingly important agricultural pest. Historically， as studies of plant-herbivore interactions have focused largely on insects， considerably less research has investigated plant responses to spider mite herbivores， especially in grasses. To identify intraspecific differences in maize response to T. urticae， we collected RNA-seq data from three maize (Zea mays) inbred lines (B73， B75 and B49) as well as two F1 lines arising from crosses between B73 x B75 and B73 x B96. For each maize line， RNA-seq data was collected from uninfested leaves (control) and leaves infested with T. urticae for 24 hours.,The experiment was performed with four or eight (in the case of B73 only) biological replicates across each of the following (48 samples in total): control uninfested B73 (B73-C)， T. urticae infested B73 (B73-T)， control uninfested B75 (B75-C)， T. urticae infested B75 (B75-T)， control uninfested B96 (B96-C)， T. urticae infested B96 (B96-T)， control uninfested B73xB75 F1s (F1-B73-B75-C)， T. urticae infested B73xB75 F1s (F1-B73-B75-T)， control uninfested B73xB96 F1s (F1-B73-B96-C) and T. urticae infested B73-B96 F1s (F1-B73-B96-T). B73 replicates 1-4 should be used as references for all samples related to B96， while B73 replicates 5-8 should be used as references for all samples related to B75.,nan,
Rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II is influenced by specific gene features and histone modifications,GSE55534,Homo sapiens,The rate of transcription elongation plays important roles in the timing of expression of full-length transcripts as well as for the regulation of alternative splicing. In this study we coupled Bru-Seq technology with 5，6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-Î²-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) to estimate the elongation rates of over 2，000 individual genes in human cells. This technique， BruDRB-Seq， revealed gene-specific differences in elongation rates with a median rate of around 1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with fast elongation rates showed higher densities of H3K79m2 and H4K20me1 marks compared to slower elongating genes. Furthermore， fast elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length， low complexity DNA sequence and distance from nearest active transcription unit. Features that negatively correlated with elongation rate included exon density and the number of LINE sequences in the gene. The BruDRB-Seq technique offers new opportunities to interrogate mechanisms of regulation of transcription elongation.,Measurement of RNA Pol II elogation rate. Normal fibroblasts (HF1 and TM)， Cockayne syndrome group B fibroblasts， K562 and MCF-7 cells were exposed to DRB for 60 minutes， after which a washout was performed. Nascent RNA was labeled using bromouridine for 10 minutes immediately after the washout. The genomic region extending from actice Trancription Start Sites was used to determine the gene's elongation rate.Please note that the nf_0h_3* samples are duplicated sample records of GSM1062445 and GSM1062446， for the convenient retrieval of the complete raw data from SRA.,24714810,Genome Res

The transcription factor Grainyhead primes epithelial enhancers for spatiotemporal activation by displacing nucleosomes [ATAC-seq Grh mutants and Human GRHL],GSE108019,Drosophila melanogaster;Homo sapiens,Transcriptional enhancers function as docking platforms for combinations of transcription factors to control gene expression. How enhancer sequences determine nucleosome occupancy， transcription factor recruitment， and transcriptional activation in vivo remains unclear. Using ATAC-seq across a panel of Drosophila inbred strains we found that SNPs affecting Grainyhead binding sites causally determine the accessibility of epithelial enhancers. We show that deletion or ectopic expression of Grh causes loss or gain of DNA accessibility， respectively. However， while Grh binding is necessary for enhancer accessibility， it is insufficient to activate enhancers. Finally， we show that human Grh homologs， GRHL1/2/3， function similarly. We conclude that Grh binding is necessary and sufficient for the opening of epithelial enhancers， but not for their activation. Our data support the model that complex spatiotemporal expression patterns are controlled by regulatory hierarchies in which pioneer factors， such as Grh， establish tissue-specific accessible chromatin landscapes upon which other factors can act.,ATAC-seq on control and Grh mutant eye-antennal discs.ATAC-seq on control larval brains and larval brains that ectopically express  the epithelial isoform of Grh.Omni-ATAC-seq on control MCF7 cells and on MCF7 cells with GRHL1，2，3 knockdown.Experiments to establish the pioneering role of Grainyhead.,29867222,Nat Genet
TSA-Seq Mapping of Nuclear Genome Organization [seq],GSE81553,Homo sapiens,We describe TSA-Seq， a new mapping method able to estimate mean chromosomal distances from nuclear speckles genome-wide and predict several Mbp chromosome trajectories between nuclear compartments without sophisticated computational modeling.  Ensemble-averaged results reveal a clear nuclear lamina to speckle axis correlated with a striking spatial gradient in genome activity.  This gradient represents a convolution of multiple， spatially separated nuclear domains， including two types of transcription ?hot-zones?.  Transcription hot-zones protruding furthest into the nuclear interior and positioning deterministically very close to nuclear speckles have higher numbers of total genes， the most highly expressed genes， housekeeping genes， genes with low transcriptional pausing， and super-enhancers.,We used TSA-Seq to study genome organization relative to nuclear speckles and the nuclear lamina. For nuclear speckles， we performed TSA-Seq using two different antibodies against the protein SON and an antibody against a phosphorylated epitope of the protein SC35. We also performed TSA-Seq using an antibody against RNA Pol II as a general marker for active nuclear domains to compare with the speckle TSA-Seq chromosome patterns. For the nuclear lamina， we performed TSA-Seq using antibodies against lamin B and Lamin A/C. For each TSA-Seq experiment， a no primary control experiment was done in parallel， where the same TSA-Seq procedure is performed but with no added primary antibody.,30154186,J Cell Biol
XH lncRNA tend to participate in transcriptional or development regulations as their coding neighbors,GSE62899,Mus musculus,We report that head to head long noncoding RNAs contribute to transcription and developmental process. Thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in the whole genome， and classified to several subgroups based on the genome position with their coding neighbors. XH， the head to head subgroup is associated with transcription and development in GO analysis. Here， we knockdown serveral XH lncRNA by shRNA in embryonic stem cells and induce nondirectional differentiation by removing LIF or neural differentiation by RA. Knockdown of XH lncRNAs led to uniform downregulation of nearby coding genes， and form regulatory circuits with its nearby coding genes to fine-tune embryonic lineage development. We propose that XH lncRNA may function primarily as 'cis-regulators' of the expression of nearby protein-coding genes， and tend to participate in transcriptional or development regulations as their coding neighbors.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal the differentially expressed genes between wild-type or XH lncRNA knockdown ESCs during differentiation.,nan,
Spatiotemporal role of the lncRNA Evx1as in embryonic patterning,GSE104292,Mus musculus,We performed spatial transcriptome analysis on cryosections of gastrulating embryos from E6.5 to E7.5 by low-input RNA sequencing (Geo-seq). Careful spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that the lncRNA Evx1as plays a transient spatiotemporal role in regulating embryonic patterning during gastrulation， yet is dispensable for overall development and survival. Altogether， these results suggest that many lncRNAs are generally dispensable for normal development and survival， but may be selectively required in a particular context in vivo.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal the spatiotemporal role of lncRNA Evx1as in embryonic patterning.,29420831,J Mol Cell Biol

Identification of LEC1 binding sites in soybean embryos at 3 developmental stages,GSE99882,Glycine max,LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1)， an atypical subunit of the NF-Y CCAAT binding transcription factor， is a central regulator that controls many aspects of seed development including the maturation phase during which seeds accumulate storage macromolecules and embryos acquire the ability to withstand desiccation.    To define the gene network and developmental processes controlled by LEC1， genes regulated directly by and downstream of LEC1 were identified.   In order to identify the genes bound by LEC1 in soybean embryos， we used two antibodies specific for soybean LEC1 (GmLEC1) and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using chromatin isolated from soybean embryos at the cotyledon， early maturation and mid-maturation stages.,Identification of LEC1 binding sites in soybean embryos at 3 developmental stages (cotyledon， early maturation and mid-maturation)， using two distinct antibodies directed against soybean LEC1 (GmLEC1).

Transgenerational inheritance of mitochondrial stress adaptation in C. elegans,GSE85835,Caenorhabditis elegans,Using Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate environmental cues-induced mitochondrial dysfunction， we found that exposure to electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors at the parental generation initiates the transmission of heritable information to descendants and make descendants stress-adaptive. This mitochondrial stress adaptation phenotype can persist for at least three generations. Animals lacking histone H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers， or the methyltransferase of N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA)， lose the ability to initiate stress adaptation in progeny. H3K4me3 plays a role upstream of 6mA， while both mark promoter regions of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt ) genes and activate the UPR mt pathway to alleviate mitochondrial damage.,Profile H3K4me3 occupancy in whole body from L3-L4 mix C. elegans， worms were treated with antimycin A (AA) or not treated (NT).,nan,

Multiplexed engineering and analysis of endogenous enhancer activity in single cells: Mosaic-Seq of 10 enhancers in combination,GSE96827,Homo sapiens,Transcriptional enhancers orchestrate cell-type specific gene expression programs critical to eukaryotic development， physiology， and disease. However， despite the large number of enhancers now identified， only a small number have been functionally assessed. Here， we develop MOsaic Single-cell Analysis by Indexed CRISPR Sequencing (Mosaic-seq)， a method that measures one direct phenotype of enhancer repression: change of the transcriptome， at the single cell level. Using dCas9-KRAB to suppress enhancer function， we first implement a multiplexed system to allow the simultaneous measurement of the transcriptome and detection of sgRNAs by single cell RNA sequencing. We validate this approach by targeting the HS2 enhancer in the well-studied beta-globin locus. Next， through computational simulation， we demonstrate strategies to robustly detect changes in gene expression in these single cell measurements. Finally， we use Mosaic-seq to target 71 hypersensitive regions belonging to 15 super-enhancers in K562 cells by utilizing a lentiviral library containing 241 unique-barcoded sgRNAs. Our results demonstrate that Mosaic-seq is a reliable approach to study enhancer function in single cells in a high-throughput manner.,The overall design consists of RNA sequencing in bulk and in single K562 cells. As a control， we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of K562 cells expressing dCas9-KRAB and a control sgRNA targeting the non-expressed HSBP1 gene in two biological replicates. As a pilot project， we performed single cell RNA-Seq of dCas9-KRAB K562 cells after pooled infection of a library of 10 sgRNA viruses targeting promoters and enhancers in the beta-globin locus. As controls for this experiment， we individually infected these 10 sgRNAs and either performed 1) bulk RNA sequencing or 2) single cell RNA sequencing after pooling the separately infected cells. Finally， we scaled this single-cell approach to measure transcriptome changes for a library of 241 sgRNAs spanning 71 hypersensitive sites from 15 super-enhancers in K562 cells. The data in this GEO series relate to the application of Mosaic-Seq for combinatorial repression of enhancers. Four experiments are performed with low MOI， and one is performed at high MOI.,28416141,Mol Cell
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of rice in response to controlled drought stress at vegetative,GSE65022,Oryza sativa Japonica Group,In this study， genome-wide transcriptome profiling was used to understand molecular genetic mechanism of drought tolerance in rice. Illumina High-Seq 2000 platform was used for sequencing RNA from leaf tissue of rice plants exposed to controlled drought stress and well-watered conditions. The differentially expressed genes were used to identify biological process and cis-regulatory elements enriched under drought stress compared to well-watered conditions.,Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare plants were exposed to controlled drought stress and well-watered conditions at the vegetative stage. Controlled drought (DR) stress was applied on 45 day old plants following gravimetric approach. The soil water content was brought down to 40% field capacity over a period of 3-4 days and plants were maintained at that level for 10 days by weighing the pots daily at a fixed time of the day and replenishing the water lost through evapotranspiration. Another set of plants were maintained at 100% FC as well-watered (WW) condition. Total RNA isolated from leaf tissue was used for RNA-sequencing. Two biological replicates per sample were sequenced. cDNA library was constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Plant kit (Illumina). Sequencing was carried out on each library to generate 50 bp SE reads using Illumina High-Seq 2000 platform. The transcriptome reads were mapped to the rice reference genome sequence (MSU 7.0) with tophat1.3.1 using the programâs default parameters (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu). Mapped RNA-Seq reads were assembled into transcripts by Cufflinks (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/) and differentially expressed genes were identified by using Cuffdiff.,nan,
RNA-seq data from human SGBS adipocytes differentiated with marine oxohexadecenoic acids,GSE115827,Homo sapiens,We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic acid (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic acid (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Synthesis and biological characterization show that these are PPARÎ±/Î³ dual agonists. Herein we report the gene expression data from human SGBS pre-adipocytes， stimulated to differentiate with 1， 2 or the classical PPARÎ³ agonist rosiglitazone. The transcriptome analysis shows that both compounds induce anti-diabetic gene programs in adipocytes by upregulating insulin-sensitizing adipokines and repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines.,Human SGBS pre-adipocytes were stimulated with adipogenic media supplemented with either (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic acid， (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic acid， or rosiglitazone from day 0 to day 4. On day 4， agonists were withdrawn， and the cells were allowed to differentiate following standard protocol. On day 8， RNA was isolated and sent to sequencing.,29940464,Eur J Med Chem
Early-life gene expression in neurons modulates lasting epigenetic states [ChIP-Seq],GSE104578,Mus musculus,In mammals during the early postnatal period the environment plays a critical role in promoting the final steps in neuronal development. While epigenetic factors are thought to contribute to this process， the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that in the brain during early life the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A transiently binds across transcribed regions of lowly expressed genes， and its binding specifies the pattern of DNA methylation at CA sequences (mCA) within these genes. We find that DNMT3A occupancy and mCA deposition within the transcribed regions of genes is negatively regulated by gene transcription and may be modified by early-life experience. Once deposited， mCA is bound by the methyl-DNA-binding protein MECP2 and functions in a rheostat-like manner to fine-tune the cell type-specific transcription of genes that are critical for brain function.,ChIP-seq from mouse brain tissue and neurons,29056337,Cell
Designing a single cell RNA sequencing benchmark dataset to compare protocols and analysis methods (Drop-Seq),GSE118706,Homo sapiens,Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has undergone rapid development in recent years and brings new challenges in data processing and analysis.

Biphasic polysaccharide metabolism of Alteromonas macleodii 83-1 analyzed by RNA-Seq,GSE107306,Alteromonas macleodii,Polysaccharides from macroalgae are important bacterial nutrient source and central biogeochemical component in the oceans. To illuminate the cellular mechanisms of polysaccharide degradation by marine bacteria， growth of Alteromonas macleodii 83-1 on a mix of laminarin， alginate and pectin was characterized using transcriptomics， proteomics and exometabolomics. A. macleodii 83-1 showed two distinct growth stages， with exponential growth during laminarin utilization followed by maintenance during simultaneous alginate/pectin utilization. The biphasic growth coincided with major temporal shifts in gene expression and metabolite secretion， enabling to define major/accessory polysaccharide utilization loci， reconstruct the complete degradation pathways for each polysaccharide， as well as identify temporal phenotypes in other relevant traits. FT-ICR-MS revealed a distinct suite of secreted metabolites for each growth phase， with pyrroloquinoline quinone exclusively produced with alginate/pectin. The finding of substrate-unique phenotypes indicates an exquisite adaptation to polysaccharide utilization with probable relevance for the degradation of macroalgal biomass， which comprises a complex mix of polysaccharides. Moreover， substrate-unique exometabolomes possibly influence metabolic interactions with other community members. Overall， the presence of fine-tuned genetic machineries for polysaccharide degradation and the widespread detection of related CAZymes in global locations indicate an ecological relevance of A. macleodii in marine polysaccharide cycling and bacteria-algae interactions.,Alteromonas macleodii 83-1 cells were grown on a mix of three polysaccharides (laminarin， pectin， alginate) in triplicates (Mix1-3). As control， cells were grown on glucose also in triplicates (Glucose1-3).

Differentiation enhances Zika virus infection in neuronal brain cells,GSE121534,Homo sapiens,Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging， mosquito-borne pathogen associated with a widespread 2015â2016 epidemic in the Western Hemisphere and a proven cause of microcephaly and other fetal brain defects in infants born to infected mothers. ZIKV infections have been also linked to other neurological illnesses in infected adults and children， including Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS)， acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and meningoencephalitis， but the viral pathophysiology behind those conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigated ZIKV infectivity in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells， both undifferentiated and following differentiation with retinoic acid. We perform RNA seq， and global trancriptome analysis to corroborate the effect of retinoic acid in SH-SY5Y cells. Then we analyze the virus infection in differentiated and undifferntiated cells. We found that multiple ZIKV strains， representing both the prototype African and contemporary Asian epidemic lineages， were able to replicate in SH-SY5Y cells. Differentiation with resultant expression of mature neuron markers increased infectivity in these cells， and the extent of infectivity correlated with degree of differentiation.  Enhanced ZIKV infectivity in a neural cell line following differentiation may contribute to viral neuropathogenesis in the developing or mature central nervous system.,Analysis of Zika virus infection in one neuroblastoma cell line differentiated， or not with retinoic acid.,nan,
Targeted sequencing by a CRISPR-assistant target enrichment-sequencing (CATE-seq),GSE119994,Homo sapiens,Targeted sequencing of genome is essential to the basic biological research and biomedicine. Therefore， various targeted enrichment methods have been developed for this end， in which various hybridization-based methods have been most widely used. However， the current hybridization-based methods (both on solid or in solution) are still restricted by the intrinsic shortcomings of nucleic acid hybridization. In this study， by combining an engineered dCas9-sgRNA with widely used magnetic isolation， we developed a new strategy to enrich target genomic DNAs in high efficiency. In this strategy， target DNA was firstly specifically recognized and bound by a complex of dCas9 and capture sgRNA (csgRNA). The DNA-dCas9-csgRNA complex was then captured on magnetic beads through the annealing of elongated 3â² end of csgRNA with single-stranded capture oligonucleotides coupled on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. We thus named the strategy as CRISPR-assistant target enrichment (CATE). The enriched DNAs can be analyzed by the next generation sequencing (NGS). We thus named the technique as CATE-seq. Used the technique， we successfully enriched 35 target exons of 6 genes in 6 cell lines by using 54 csgRNA. We found that the target genomic DNA fragments such as exons could be efficiently enriched and analyzed by CATE-seq. The technique has several significant advantages over the current hybridization-based methods， including high simplicity， specificity， sensitivity， and throughput. This study therefore provides a new powerful tool for targeted sequencing.,we developed a new dCas9/sgRNA-based target enrichment technique by combining dCas9-sgRNA with magnetic separation. The 3â² end of sgRNA was redesigned to add a short capture sequence in complementary with a single-stranded capture oligonucleotide coupled on magnetic beads. The special sgRNA was named as capture sgRNA (csgRNA). The single-stranded capture oligonucleotides is anchored on the surface of magnetic beads by biotin-streptavidin interaction， in which the single-stranded capture oligonucleotide was modified by biotin and streptavidin was coated on the surface of magnetic beads. In order to enrich target DNA fragments from an input DNA library， the input DNA library was firstly incubated with the dCas9-csgRNA to form DNA-dCas9-csgRNA complex， which were them captured by the capture oligonucleotides-coupled magnetic beads via annealing of capture sequence of csgRNA with capture oligonucleotides. The captured DNA-dCas9-csgRNA complex can be easily isolated from input DNA library by a magnetic separation. The enriched DNA can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing. We named this technique as CATE-seq. We used this technique successfully enriched 35 exons of 6 genes in 6 cell lines， indicating the feasibility， reliability， specificity， and simplicity of the new target enrichment sequencing technique.,nan,
MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication,GSE117274,Mus musculus,During genome replication， parental histones are recycled to newly replicated DNA with their post-translational modifications (PTMs). It remains unknown whether sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly. Here， we measured histone PTM partition to sister chromatids in embryonic stem cells. We found that parental histones H3-H4 segregate to both daughter DNA strands with a weak leading strand bias， skewing partition at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders and enhancers proximal to replication initiation zones. Segregation of parental histones to the leading strand increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2， part of the replicative helicase， exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry. This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism for how symmetric cell division is ensured by the replication machinery.,Measurement of partition of new histone H4 (K5ac) and old histones H4 (K20me2) and H3 (K36me3) to Sister Chromatids After Replication in wild type and MCM2_2A histone binding mutants in mouse embryonic stem cells.,30115746,Science

Toxicogenomic responses of low level anticancer drug exposures in Daphnia magna,GSE115386,Daphnia magna,The use of anticancer drugs in chemotherapy is increasing， leading to growing environmental concentrations of imatinib mesylate (IMA)， cisplatinum (CDDP)， and etoposide (ETP) in aquatic systems. Previous studies have shown that these anticancer drugs cause DNA damage in the crustacean Daphnia magna at low， environmentally relevant concentrations. To explore the mechanism of action of these compounds and the downstream effects of DNA damage on D. magna growth and development at a sensitive life stage， we exposed neonates to low level concentrations equivalent to those that elicit DNA damage (IMA: 2000 ng/L， ETP: 300 ng/L， CDDP: 10 ng/L) and performed transcriptomic analysis using an RNA-seq approach. RNA sequencing generated 14 million reads per sample， which were aligned to the D. magna genome and assembled， producing approximately 23，000 transcripts per sample. Over 90% of the transcripts showed homology to proteins in GenBank， revealing a high quality transcriptome assembly， although functional annotation was much lower. RT-qPCR was used to identify robust biomarkers and confirmed the downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) involved in neuropeptide regulation across all three anticancer drugs and the down-regulation of DNA topoisomerase II by ETP. RNA-seq analysis also allowed for an in depth exploration of the differential splicing of transcripts revealing that regulation of different gene isoforms predicts potential impacts on translation and protein expression， providing a more meaningful assessment of transcriptomic data. Enrichment analysis and investigation of affected biological processes suggested that the DNA damage caused by ETP and IMA influences cell cycle regulation and GPCR signaling.

Epigenetic characterization of NKG2C high cells of primigravid decidual NK， multigravid decidual NK， nulligravid endometrial NK and multigravid endometrial NK,GSE100636,Homo sapiens,Natural killer cells (NKs) are abundant in the human decidua. Several diseases of poor placental development are associated with first pregnancies， and we thus looked to characterize differences in decidual NKs in first versus repeated pregnancies. We discovered a population unique to repeated pregnancies， which possesses a novel transcriptome and epigenetic signature， characterized with high expression levels of the receptors NKG2C and LILRB1. Activation of these receptors leads to increased production and secretion of IFNÎ³ and VEGFa， the latter found to support vascular sprouting and trophoblast-tumor growth. We propose that this population represents NK âmemoryâ of pregnancy， and have named these cells Pregnancy Trained decidual NK cells (PTdNKs). We further suggest that the precursors of PTdNKs are found in the endometrium. PTdNKs may prove useful in understanding and treating disorders of poor placentation.,NKG2Chigh (and negative) decidual and endometrial NK cells， from nulligravid， primigravid and multigravid women,29768178,Immunity
Transcriptional plasticity， priming and commitment in hematopoietic lineages [CRISP-seq],GSE113494,Mus musculus,Differentiation of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) constantly produces the cell types of the blood and immune system. The dynamics of this process and the hierarchy of downstream oligopotent stem cell differentiation remain controversial. Here we dissect hematopoietic progenitor populations in a minimally biased fashion using extensive single cell sampling from murine bone marrow. We characterize the HSC population， define its quiescent transcriptional program and validate it with label retaining assays and cytokine mediated stimulations. Analysis of initial HSC commitment defines marked bifurcation of erythroid/megakaryocytic cells from myeloid/lymphoid lineages. Unexpectedly， we find states that mix transcription of pre-myeloid and pre-lymphoid genes. This suggests a model in which more than one differentiation trajectory can link HSC to several cell types.

Genome-wide analysis of Estrogen Receptor-mediated response to acute Estradiol treatment in liver (ChIP-seq),GSE70346,Mus musculus,Estrogen-based treatments have numerous extra-reproductive effects. On the one hand， they have protective metabolic actions against abdominal fat accumulation， type 2 diabetes， liver steatosis，â¦ But， on the other hand， the oral route of administration， presumably due to a hepatic impact on liver-derived coagulation factors， appears to increase risks of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The characterization of liver genes expression regulations by these hormones thereby appears of utmost interest， but the estrogen-sensitive transcriptome of liver and ER cistrome was so far explored under chronic hormonal treatment. To explore the early steps of these mechanisms， we determined here the short-term changes in liver transcriptional responses to acute E2 administration， and aimed to characterize the mechanisms allowing these programs to be engaged. Collectively， through the comparison of mice expressing or not ER， our data demonstrate that acute administration of E2 provokes genes expression variations which fit with a crucial role of ER in the prevention of liver steatosis in mice fed with a high fat diet by E2. They also evidenced higher proportion of ER binding sites (BSs) located at the direct vicinity (distance <3kb) of regulated genes than what is determined in human cancer cell models. Besides this specific aspect of ER cistrome in vivo， we unexpectedly found that 40 % of the BSs of the pioneer factor Foxa2 were dependent upon the expression of ER that indirectly influences the distribution of the nucleosomes harbouring a dimethylated H3K4 around these Foxa2 sites.,Whole-genome analysis of estrogen receptor (ER) and FOXA2 binding events associated with the cartography of two histone marks (H3K4me2 and H3K27ac) in livers from wild-type or ERKO mice.,27164166,Mol Endocrinol

Circular RNAs in cattle muscle: developmental stage-dependent changes,GSE87908,Bos taurus,Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified in various tissues and cell types from human， monkey， porcine and mouse. However， expression profile of circRNAs across cattle muscle development has never been investigated. Here， we examine the expression of circRNA in cattle skeletal muscle at embryonic stage and adult stage， exhibiting the first report of circRNA in the cattle muscle development of a large animal. 12，981 circRNAs are identified and annotated in Qinchuan cattle muscle tissues， including 530 circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs). We discovered that one parental gene could generate multiple circRNA isoforms with only one or two circRNA isoforms being expressed at higher levels， and several host genes produced different alternative circularization numbers between different muscle development stages. The most circRNA candidates contained two to seven exons， and the genomic distance of the back-splicing site was generally no more than 50 kb. The flanking intron length of most circRNAs was not more than 105 nt and the mean length of upstream or downstream flanking intron was about 11，000 nt. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis confirmed the expression profile of these circRNAs， including several highly abundant circRNAs， and a subset of differently expressed circRNAs according to the high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. These results display that an abundant circRNAs are dynamically expressed in a spatio-temporal manner in cattle muscle， indicating important and diverse functions during mammalian muscle development.,Six longissimus muscle samples from Qinchuan cattles of two developmental states (embryonic， 90 d; and adult， 24 M old) were collected from Yiming abattoir， a local slaughterhouse of XiâAn， P.R.

Allele-specific H3K27me3， H3K27ac and Ctcf ChIP-seq in Smchd1 control and Smchd1 deleted female neural stem cells. [H3K27me3],GSE112045,Mus musculus,We sought to examine whether the non-canonical SMC protein Smchd1 plays a role in chromosome conformation. We used in situ Hi-C to analyse chromosome conformation changes upon deletion of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1 in female neural stem cells.

We additionally analysed Smchd1 binding genome-wide using ChIP-seq. Together， we find that deletion of Smchd1 alters chromosome conformation at Smchd1 target genes including the inactive X chromosome， Hox genes and imprinted loc. Smchd1 deletion results in gain in Ctcf binding and activation of enhancers. We propose Smchd1 functions by limiting Ctcf-mediated chromosome looping.,n=3 Smchd1del/del vs n=3 Smchd1del/fl female neural stem cell lines analysed by RNA-seq.,30127357,Nat Struct Mol Biol

A CRISPR loss-of-function Hepatic progenitor cells expansion screen in liver organoids,GSE111269,Mus musculus;synthetic construct,Biliary epithelial cells (BECs) form bile ducts in the liver， and are facultative liver stem cells that establish a ductular reaction (DR) to support liver regeneration following injury. Liver damage induces periportal LGR5+ putative liver stem cells which can form BEC-like organoids， suggesting RSPO-LGR4/5-mediated WNT/Î²-catenin activity is important for a DR. We addressed the roles for this and other signaling pathways in a DR by performing a focused CRISPR-based loss-of-function screen in BEC-like organoids， followed by in vivo validation and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found BECs lack and do not require LGR4/5-mediated WNT/Î²-Catenin signaling during DR， while YAP and mTORC1 signaling are required for this process. Upregulation of LGR5/AXIN2 is required in hepatocytes to enable their regenerative capacity in response to injury. Together， these data highlight heterogeneity within the BEC pool and delineate signaling pathways involved.,The 1000 element library is a pooled CRISPR library with 1000 unique CRISPR sgRNA.  The take rate library is a DNA barcode library (https://www.cellecta.com/content/uploads/2014/10/Cellecta-PAC-Barcode-Library-13Kx13K-Plasmid-12082901.pdf). The manuscript presents the finding of a pooled CRISPR screen on liver organoid culture system using a 1000 element CRISPR library.  To develop the screening assay， we evaluated the clonal growth kinetics of the liver organoids by infecting the organoids with the take rate library which is composed of DNA barcodes that do not perform genetic perturbation.  The take rate library result confirms that the liver organoids do not display strong clonal growth and thus are suitable for screening.We use cell survival and proliferation as the measure for identifying signalling pathways regulating HPC expansion in vitro.,31080135,Cell Stem Cell

Identification of miR-29b targets using 3-cyanovinylcarbazole containing mimics - mouse,GSE120764,Mus musculus,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved â¼22 nt small noncoding RNAs that bind partially complementary sequences in target transcripts. MicroRNAs regulate both translation and transcript stability， and play important roles in development， cellular homeostasis， and disease. There are limited approaches available to agnostically identify microRNA targets transcriptome-wide， and methods using miRNA mimics， which in principle identify direct miRNA:transcript pairs， have low sensitivity and specificity. Here， we describe a novel method to identify microRNA targets using miR-29b mimics containing 3cyanovinylcarbazole ( CNV K)， a photolabile nucleoside analog. We demonstrate that biotin-tagged， CNV K-containing miR-29b ( CNV K-miR-29b) mimics are nontoxic in cell culture， associate with endogenous mammalian Argonaute2， arehighly sensitive for known targets and recapitulate endogenous transcript destabilization. Partnering CNV K-miR-29b with ultra-low-input RNA sequencing， we recover â¼40% of known miR-29b targets and findrobust conservation of the focal adhesion and apoptotic target pathways in mouse and mouse. We also identify hundreds of novel targets， including NRAS， HOXA10， and KLF11， with a validation rate of 71% for a subset of 73 novel target transcripts interrogated using a high-throughput luciferase assay. Consistent with previous reports， we show that both endogenous miR-29b and CNV K-miR-29b are trafficked to the nucleus， but find no evidence of nuclear-specific miR-29b transcript binding. This may indicate that miR-29b nuclear sequestration is a regulatory mechanism in itself. We suggest that CNV K-containing small RNA mimics may find applicability in other experimental models,pulldown assay with 3x3x3x3 design: miRNA mimic and scrambled miRNA mimic x input and pulldown conditions.

Cicero Predicts cis-Regulatory DNA Interactions from Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Data,GSE109828,Homo sapiens,Linking regulatory DNA elements to their target genes， which may be located hundreds of kilobases away， remains challenging. Here， we introduce Cicero， an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of âchromatin hubsââthey are enriched for physical proximity， interact with a common set of transcription factors， and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture， sequence determinants， and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.,sci-ATAC-seq data was collected on human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM) in culture at four timepoints after serum switch to induce differentiation into myotubes， 0 hours， 24 hours， 48 hours and 72 hours.

Targeting the HBZ Viral Oncoprotein Transcriptional Network in Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ChIP-Seq),GSE94732,Homo sapiens,Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) is a frequently incurable disease associated with the human lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). The transcription factor HBZ is the only virally encoded gene that is expressed in all ATLL cases， but it is unclear why it may be essential in ATLL and how it might be targeted therapeutically. Here we performed RNA interference screening of ATLL lines and discovered that their proliferation depends on the transcription factors BATF3 and IRF4， which regulate the identity of normal immune cells. These factors， which are highly expressed in ATLL， cooperatively bind and transactivate genes that distinguish ATLL from other T cell malignancies， including BATF3 itself. HBZ binds to an ATLL-specific BATF3 super-enhancer and thereby regulates the expression of BATF3 and its downstream targets， including the oncogene MYC. The BET protein inhibitor JQ1 collapsed the transcriptional network directed by HBZ and BATF3， and was consequently toxic for ATLL lines and patient samples in vitro， and blocked growth of ATLL xenografts. Our study demonstrates that the HTLV-I virus exploits a regulatory module that can potentially be attacked therapeutically with BET protein inhibitors.,For IRF4 ChIP-seq (n=4)， KK1 and ST1 cell line chromatins were immuno-precipitated with normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology， sc2027) or IRF4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology， sc6059 and sc11450 (1:1 mix)).

Cooperation between TLX1 and the NUP214-ABL1/STAT5 signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,GSE102209,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The NUP214-ABL1 fusion is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is significantly associated with overexpression of the TLX1 or TLX3 transcription factors in T-cell acute lymphoblastic (T-ALL). Here we show that NUP214-ABL1 kinase cooperates with TLX1 in driving T-ALL development using a transgenic mouse model. Using ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq， we show that TLX1 and STAT5， the downstream effector of NUP214-ABL1， selectively increase the accessibility of enhancer regions， and cooperatively activate the expression of key proto-oncogenes such as MYC and BCL2. Moreover， MYC is also part of the TLX1/STAT5 complex and inhibition of both MYC and STAT5 leads to reduction of target gene expression.,RNA-sequencing of different conditions: wild type， NUP214-ABL1 +， TLX1 +， NUP214-ABL1+TLX1 +， NUP214-ABL1+TLX3 +.

Use single cell RNA sequencing to study the molecular siganature of primary human Megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor,GSE112692,Homo sapiens,Megakaryocytic-Erythroid Progenitors (MEP) produce circulating red blood cells and platelets. Although much is known regarding megakaryocytic (Mk) and erythroid (E) maturation， detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the MEP fate decision have not been determined. Single cell RNA sequencing of highly enriched populations of primary human common myeloid progenitors (CMP)， MEP， megakaryocyte progenitors (MKP) and erythroid progenitors (ERP)， revealed that MEP have a distinct molecular signature with co-expression of genes otherwise expressed exclusively in CMP， MKP or ERP. Cell cycle genes are significantly differentially expressed between MEP， MKP， and ERP. We therefore tested the effects on MEP fate of genetic and pharmacologic modulation of cell cycle progression， and found that cell cycle activity mechanistically controls MEP fate decisions; cell cycle activation promotes E whereas cell cycle inhibition promotes Mk specification. The data obtained from healthy cells can now be applied to the mechanisms underlying benign and malignant disease states of Mk and E production.,To address the heterogeneity of the MEP enriched population， we performed single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of FACS-enriched MEP， MKP and ERP， and CMP. Specifically， we tested whether MEP have an expression signature that is distinct from CMP， MKP and ERP. Single cells were captured and lysed using the Fluidigm C1 platform and sequenced to more accurately identify and profile the transcriptome of multi-lineage cells. On average， there were 504，984 aligned reads per cell， with an average of 5，028 genes expressed (FPKM>0.1) per cell. We first performed an analysis of the scRNA-seq data from sorted CMP， MEP， MKP and ERP populations from a single PBSC donor (donor-1， n=246 cells). Unsupervised analysis with the recentlyÂ described ICGS software identified separate major gene expressionÂ clusters for each of the sorted populations along with subdivisions ofÂ the CMP， MEP， MKP and ERP. To confirm the major gene expressionÂ clusters associated with the four sorted populations， we performed scRNA-Seq analysis of cells from a differentÂ donorÂ (donor-2， n=294 cells) sorted using a complementary gating strategy， but running 1 plate of MEPs andÂ 1 plate of a mix of 55% MKP and 45% ERP.,30463007,Cell Rep

Bisulfite-free， nano-scale analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single base resolution,GSE112048,Homo sapiens,High-resolution detection of genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) sites of small-scale samples represents a continuous challenge. Here， we present CATCH-seq， a bisulfite-free， base-resolution method for the genome-wide detection of 5hmC. CATCH-seq is based on selective 5hmC oxidation， labeling and subsequent C-to-T transition during PCR. Applications of CATCH-seq to nano-scale DNA samples reveal previously underappreciated non-CG 5hmCs in the hESC genome and base-resolution hydroxymethylome in human cell-free DNA.,"We developed a method named ""CATCH-Seq"" ， a bisulfite-free， base-resolution method for the genome-wide detection of 5hmC.

The transcriptomic response to a short day to long day shift in the reference legume Medicago truncatula,GSE118893,Medicago truncatula,Photoperiod regulated flowering is a well understood developmental pathway in the intensively studied Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis thaliana and in the monocot rice， but less so in other angiosperm groups. One such group， the temperate legumes in the Fabaceae family which are important both agriculturally and ecologically， accelerate their flowering in response to long-day photoperiods (LD)， but lack functional homologues of key regulatory genes present in A. thaliana such as CO. Curiously previous work in the reference legume Medicago truncatula has shown that floral activator MtFTa1， which is upregulated by LD and vernalisation， does not exhibit a peak in expression at dusk like its homologue in A. thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T， instead MtFTa1 maintains a near constant pattern of expression. In addition legumes possess for other FT-like genes such as the MtFTb genes expressed in LD which may also act in the regulation of flowering time. This study utilises RNA-Seq to identify genes which may regulate or be co-expressed with these FT-like genes in Medicago truncatula. Following a shift from short-day photoperiods to inductive long-days genes which alter their pattern of expression are distinguished from those which just alter their magnitude of expression (and those that do neither). Specifically this study focuses on the first few hours of the day in the young leaves which coincides with the first diurnal peak of the FTb genes. It goes on to categorise these genes into groups with similar patterns of expression using c-means clustering. In the process this study identifies a number of potential candidate genes for future studies to consider.,Combines two similar experiments where plants were grown in short-day photoperiods and shifted to long-day photoperiods after 10 days. Triplicate RNA-seq libraries from both short-day and long-day leaf tissue were generated in experiment 1 at ZT0 and ZT4 at 13 days. In experiment 2 at ZT4 at 15 days.,30923654,PeerJ
Comparative transcriptome analysis of Shewanella MR-1 under oxic vs. suboxic conditions,GSE65062,Shewanella oneidensis MR-1,"To understand how cell physiological state affects mRNA translation， we used the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 grown under steady state conditions at either 20% or 8.5% O2. Using a combination of quantitative proteomics and RNA-Seq， we generated high-confidence data on >1000 mRNA and protein pairs. By using a steady state model， we found that differences in proteinâmRNA ratios were primarily due to differences in the translational efficiency of specific genes. When oxygen levels were lowered， 28% of the proteins showed at least a 2-fold change in expression. Transcription levels were significantly altered for 26% of the protein changes; translational efficiency was significantly altered for 46% and a combination of both was responsible for the remaining 28%. Changes in translational efficiency were significantly correlated with the codon usage pattern of the genes and measurable tRNA pools changed in response to altered O2 levels. Our results suggest that changes in the translational efficiency of proteins， in part due to altered tRNA pools， is a major determinant of regulated alterations in protein expression levels in bacteria. For further details， see the resulting publication and its supplemental material: Taylor， R. C. et al.，  ""Changes in translational efficiency is a dominant regulatory mechanism in the environmental response of bacteria""， Integrative Biology， 2013， 5， 1393.

Correlating anatomy and function with gene expression in individual neurons by combining in vivo labeling， patch clamp and single cell RNA-seq,GSE90822,Mus musculus,The classification of neurons into distinct types is an ongoing effort aimed at revealing and understanding the diversity of the components of the nervous system. Recently available methods allow us to determine the gene expression pattern of individual neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex to generate powerful categorization schemes. For a thorough understanding of neuronal diversity such genetic categorization schemes need to be combined with traditional classification parameters like position， axonal projection or response properties to sensory stimulation. Here we describe a method to link the gene expression of individual neurons with their position， axonal projection or sensory response properties. Neurons are labeled in vivo based on their anatomical or functional properties and， using patch clamp pipettes， their RNA individually harvested in vitro for RNAseq. With this method we can determine the genetic expression pattern of functionally and anatomically identified individual neurons.,single cortical neurons were patch clamped and the RNA harvested; single neuron mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing,29249941,Front Cell Neurosci
T helper cells modulate intestinal stem cell renewal and differentiation,GSE106510,Mus musculus,Using single-cell RNA-seq of intestinal epithelial cells we identify surprising expression of MHC class II， which participates in a novel interaction between gut-resident CD4+ T cells and epithelial stem cells， governing the balance between stem cell differentiation and renewal.,In the small intestine， a niche of accessory cell types supports the generation of mature epithelial cell types from intestinal stem cells (ISCs). It is unclear， however， if and how immune cells in the niche affect ISC fate or the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Here， we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify MHC class II (MHCII) machinery enrichment in two subsets of Lgr5+ ISCs. We show that MHCII+ Lgr5+ ISCs are non-conventional antigen-presenting cells in co-cultures with CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Stimulation of intestinal organoids with key Th cytokines affects Lgr5+ ISC renewal and differentiation in opposing ways: pro-inflammatory signals promote differentiation， while regulatory cells and cytokines reduce it. In vivo genetic perturbation of Th cells or MHCII expression on Lgr5+ ISCs impacts epithelial cell differentiation and IEC fate during infection. These interactions between Th cells and Lgr5+ ISCs， thus， orchestrate tissue-wide responses to external signals.,30392957,Cell
Characterization of genome-wide DNA binding rhythms of HNF4A,GSE118007,Mus musculus,HNF4A mRNA cycles over the coure of 24 h. To understand whether the chromatin binding of the transcription factor is also rhythmic， we performed ChIP-seq for HNF4A using mouse liver samples of ZT4 and ZT16.

DNA methylation profiling of Daphnia species.,GSE103939,Daphnia pulex;Daphnia magna,To profile the Daphnia species methylome and to achieve a better understanding of the level of variations in the methylome of Daphnia species， we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBSeq) of adult Daphnia magna Bham2 strain and Daphnia pulex Eloise Butler strain (EB45 and EB31 strains). We also analysed the correlation between gene expression and methylation in the two species， using data generated in this study and RNA-seq data from Orsini， et al. 2016. We found that methylation percentage across the genome of Daphnia spp. follows a bimodal distribution. Furthermore， CpG methylation in Daphnia predominantly occurs at coding regions. Although methylation levels significantly decrease towards the 3â end of a gene with a significant drop in methylation levels from one exon to the neighbouring intron， there is a clear spike in relative methylation levels between exon and intron boundaries， which may be linked to regulation of splicing. We further demonstrate that DNA methylation in Daphnia is responsive to intrinsic and extrinsic factors.We also compared the methylation and gene expression correlations found in Daphnia to publicly available dataset from two other invertebrate species (Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis) and two vertebrate species (Homo sapiens and Mus musculus). We observed that similar to other invertebrates， Daphniaâs genome is sparsely methylated at a lower level and the methylation is predominantly focused at gene body while in vertebrate species the genome is heavily methylated (global methylation). Although the level and distribution of methylation across CpG sites is different between vertebrates and invertebrates it is possible that methylation density at coding regions has the same function between vertebrates and invertebrates. We demonstrate evolutionary conservation of a positive correlation between high methylation density at coding regions and gene expression across vertebrates and invertebrates， leading to potentially ensuring continuous high expression of genes required throughout the life in both vertebrates and invertebrates.,Examination of DNA methylation in two different species of Daphnia (Daphnia magna bham2 and Daphnia pulex EB strains)Correlation analysis between levels of gene expression and DNA methylation (Daphnia pulex EB45).,30060190,Genome Biol Evol

Next generation sequencing of leaf transcriptome from taro (Colocasia esculenta) cultivars Niue， Palau 10， and Sam-07,GSE87777,Colocasia esculenta,Despite the fact that taro， colocasia esculenta， is an important staple food for millions of people around the world， its genome and transcriptome sequence has not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to generate transcriptome sequence information from taro cultivars Niue， Palau 10， and Sam-07. Niue and Sam-07 are highly susceptible to the taro leaf blight (TLB) disease caused by Phytophthora colocasiae， to which Palau 10 is resistant. The analysis of the taro transcriptome will facilitate gene discovery， including genes that are responsible for TLB-resistance.

Whole blood RNA sequencing in idiopathic pneumonia syndrome reveals a unique transcriptomic profile compared to ARDS,GSE84439,Homo sapiens,The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal syndrome characterized by hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates in response to an inciting event such as sepsis. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a life-saving treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies that can be complicated by ARDS. We sought to identify blood gene expression signatures that distinguish whether ARDS in BMT may be a distinct pathobiologic entity from ARDS in non-BMT patients.RNA-Seq was used to measure whole blood transcript expression differences between 26 patients meeting the Berlin definition of ARDS: 8 patients without BMT and 5 BMT patients with ARDS from the Brigham and Womenâs Registry of Critical Illness (RoCI)， as well as 7 non-BMT patients with sepsis and 6 BMT patients with sepsis.

RNA-binding protein WDR43 binds prevalently to open chromatin and promotes gene transcription,GSE110358,Mus musculus,The intricate regulation of transcription underlies cellular differentiation and development. However， the general relevance of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in polymerase (Pol) II transcription is less understood. Here we revealed that WDR43， a novel chromatin-bound RBP， promotes transcription and is essential for self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and early embryonic development. WDR43 binds to promoter-associated non-coding and nascent RNAs， localizes at thousands of gene promoters and enhancers， and interacts with the Pol II transcription machinery. Recombinant WDR43 directly promotes transcription and the release of elongation factor P-TEFb in vitro. Depletion of WDR43 in ESCs leads to global defects in Pol II pause release and mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that WDR43 maintains high-level expression of pluripotency programs by modulating Pol II activity and transcription elongation. To extend these findings， we demonstrated widespread co-occupancy of open chromatin by multiple RBPs， suggesting an unforeseen role for RBPs in transcription control,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing and genome occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing. chrTAP-seq for WDR43.,nan,
scFTD-seq: freeze-thaw lysis based， portable approach toward highly distributed single-cell 3â mRNA profiling,GSE109535,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We present sc-FTDseq， a microchip platform for single-cell freeze-thaw lysis directly toward 3â mRNA sequencing. It offers format flexibility with a much simplified， widely adoptable workflow that reduces the number of preparation steps and hands-on time， with the quality of data and the cost per sample matching that of the state-of-the-art scRNA-seq platforms. Freeze-thaw， known as an unfavorable lysis method resulting in RNA fragmentation， turns out to be fully compatible with single-cell 3â mRNA sequencing， which detects only ~50 bases at the 3â end. We applied it to the profiling of mixed populations including whole tumors for distinguishing all major cell types and to the profiling of circulating follicular helper T cells implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis.

Analysis of reads mapping revealed 4，244 previously uncharacterized transcripts， including a mass of protein-coding genes and putative functional non-coding RNA genes. Alignment of junction reads indicated over 42% of rice multiple-exon genes produce two or more distinct splicing isoforms. Itâs intriguing that we identified 1，356 putative gene fusion events， indicating the 234 fusion gene produced by trans-splicing vastly increases the complexity of rice transcriptome， together with the pervasive alternative splicing events. Digital gene expression profiling revealed most rice duplicate genes were maintained by the selection constraint on gene dosages， which would increase the genetic robustness of rice to counteract deleterious mutationsKeywords: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,mRNA expression of 8 independent rice tissues was determined by method of RNA-Seq using short reads from high throughput sequencing technology.

Allele-specific RNA-seq in Smchd1 control and Smchd1 deleted female neural stem cells.,GSE112043,Mus musculus,We sought to examine whether the non-canonical SMC protein Smchd1 plays a role in chromosome conformation. We used in situ Hi-C to analyse chromosome conformation changes upon deletion of the epigenetic regulator Smchd1 in female neural stem cells. In parallel， we analysed nucleosome accessibility using ATAC-seq， gene expression using RNA-seq，  chromatin marks H3K27me3 and H3K27ac and Ctcf binding using ChIP-seq. We additionally analysed Smchd1 binding genome-wide using ChIP-seq. Together， we find that deletion of Smchd1 alters chromosome conformation at Smchd1 target genes including the inactive X chromosome， Hox genes and imprinted loc. Smchd1 deletion results in gain in Ctcf binding and activation of enhancers. We propose Smchd1 functions by limiting Ctcf-mediated chromosome looping.,n=3 Smchd1del/del vs n=3 Smchd1del/fl female neural stem cell lines analysed by RNA-seq.,30127357,Nat Struct Mol Biol

RNAseq of drought treated  Populus trichocarpa,GSE79401,Populus trichocarpa,To identify genes that are drought-responsive we conducted drought (soil water depletion) experiments on 3-month-old *P*. *trichocarpa *clonal plants. The plants undergo five different stages based on the appearance of their shoots and leaves during the drought experiments. Stage I: The shoot and leaves are green， and the leaves are well-spread. Stage II: The leaves are droopy. Stage III: The shoot is droopy， and the leaves are partially dry. Stage IV: The leaves are brown and totally dry. Stage V: The shoot is brown. With fully irrigation， the soil water content is 74% and the xylem water content is 80.6%. Plants in Stage III (Day 5) are under a mild drought state. The soil and xylem water content in Stage III dropped to 33% and 75.3%， respectively. Stage IV (Day 6-10) is a severe drought state where the soil and xylem water content continued decreasing to 29% and 74.3%， respectively in Day 7. The stressed plants from Stage I-IV could all recover in 3 days after rehydration， but the plants in Stage V could not recover after rehydration.,We collected the xylem tissue from plants (1) without drought treatment (Control， Day 0)， (2) under mild drought stress (Stage III， Day 5)， (3) under severe drought stress (Stage IV， Day 7) followed by RNA-seq analysis.,30538157,Plant Cell
A sequence motif within chromatin entry sites directs MSL establishment on the Drosophila X chromosome,GSE11485,Drosophila melanogaster,Dosage compensation serves as a model for understanding how chromatin-modification enzymes are targeted to initiate and maintain gene regulation. In Drosophila， the MSL complex associates with active genes specifically on the male X chromosome to acetylate histone H4 at lysine 16， and increase expression of most X-linked genes approximately two-fold. To date， no DNA sequence has been discovered to explain the specificity of MSL binding. We previously hypothesized that sequence-specific targeting occurs at initiation or âchromatin entry sitesâ， but binding to the majority of sites is sequence-independent. Here we characterize more than 150 potential entry sites by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq and discover a common GA-rich MSL recognition element (MRE). The motif is only slightly enriched on the X chromosome (~2 fold)， but this is doubled when considering its preferential location within or 3â to active X-linked genes (>4 fold enrichment). When inserted on an autosome， a newly identified site can direct local MSL spreading to flanking active genes on the autosome. These results provide strong evidence for both sequence-dependent and -independent steps in MSL targeting of dosage compensation to the male X chromosome.,ChIP-chip: msl3 mutant embryos (1 g) were collected for chromatin preparation as described in Alekseyenko et al. (2006). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-MSL2 antibody， as in Larschan et al. (2007). Immunoprecipitated DNA was isolated， amplified and hybridized to NimbleGen tiling arrays as in Alekseyenko et al (2006). We performed two replicates for each type of ChIP-chip experiment.ChIP-seq: Immunoprecipitated DNA from Clone 8 cells was isolated as in Alekseyenko et al. (2006). DNA amplification was performed using the Illumina Sample Prep Kit with minor modifications. 1 Âµl adapter oligo mix was used per 100 ng ChIP DNA. The ligation mix was first amplified as detailed in the protocol and then the PCR products (3-8 Âµg) were gel-fractionated using Biorad Certified Low Range Ultra Agarose. Different fractions (100-200 bp， 200-300 bp， 300-400 bp) were collected. Purified DNA was run on the Solexa Genome Analyzer.

Bhlhe40 is an essential repressor of IL-10 during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,GSE113054,Mus musculus,The cytokine IL-10 antagonizes pathways that controlÂ Mycobacterium tuberculosisÂ (Mtb) infection. Nevertheless， the impact of IL-10 duringÂ MtbÂ infection has been difficult to decipher because loss of function studies in animal models have yielded only mild phenotypes. We have discovered that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 is required to repressÂ Il10Â expression duringÂ MtbÂ infection. Loss of Bhlhe40 in mice results in higherÂ Il10Â expression， higher bacterial burden， and early susceptibility similar to that observed in mice lacking IFN-g. Deletion ofÂ Il10Â inÂ Bhlhe40-/-Â mice reverses these phenotypes. Bhlhe40 deletion in T cells or CD11c+Â cells is sufficient to cause susceptibility toÂ Mtb. Bhlhe40 represents the first transcription factor found to be essential duringÂ MtbÂ infection to specifically regulateÂ Il10Â expression， revealing the importance of strict control of IL-10 production by innate and adaptive immune cells during infection. Our findings uncover a previously elusive but significant role for IL-10 inÂ MtbÂ pathogenesis.,Bhlhe40+/+ and Bhlhe40-/- GM-CSF-cultured bone marrow-derived cells were stimulated in the presence of 10 Âµg/ml heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra strain， Difco) for 4 hours. Bhlhe40+/+ and Bhlhe40-/- in vitro-polarized TH1 cells were stimulated with PMA (50âng/ml， Enzo Life Sciences) and ionomycin (1 ÂµM， Enzo Life Sciences) for 1.5 hours. After stimulation， cells were fixed and genomic DNA was immunoprecipitated with anti-Bhlhe40 antibody.,29773644,J Exp Med
Recovery and analysis of transcriptome subsets from pooled single-cell RNA-seq libraries,GSE119428,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To generate more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries， we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets， enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in both a cell-centric and gene-centric mode to isolate mRNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries.,targeted resequencing and original untargeted datasets of various scRNA-Seq libraries from the 10x genomics and wafergen platform,30496484,Nucleic Acids Res

Assessing the effect of SUPT4H1 RNAi on the transcription of a repeat-containing reporter construct,GSE121757,Homo sapiens,SUPT4H1 is a transcription elongation factor comprising part of the RNA polymerase II complex. Recent studies propose a selective role for SUPT4H1 in transcription of repeat-containing transcripts， the translated products of which are a hallmark of neurodegeneration in disorders such as Huntingtonâs Disease and C9orf72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To investigate the potential of SUPT4H1 as a therapeutic target in repeat-associated neurodegeneration， we engineered a reporter containing 71 hexanucleotide repeats (HNRs) encoding for pDi-amino acid repeats (DARPs) fused to EGFP. To approximate endogenous expression levels， the reporter also incorporated human C9orf72 intronic DNA immediately 5' of the hexanucleotide repeats. The reporter construct was integrated into the genome of HEK293t cells. We assessed the effect of depleting SUPT4H1 by RNAi interference on the transcriptome as a whole and on the DARP-EGFP reporter.,HEK293 cells stably expressing the intron-DARP-EGFP reporter were transfected with pools of siRNAs targeting SUPT4H1 or with scrambled control siRNAs. Starting from the same culture， six independent transfections were performed for each treatment side by side.

Global transcriptomic changes following N-deprivation in Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1: Illumina sequencing,GSE42508,Nannochloropsis oceanica,Limited systems-level understanding of oil synthesis in wild oleaginous algae has hindered the development of microalgal feedstock. Nannochloropsis is a small unicellular microalgae widely distributed in oceans and fresh water. In many large-scale and pilot-scale outdoor cultivation facilities， Nannochloropsis strains have been found to be capable of robust growth when supplied with flue gases， naturally accumulating large quantities of oils in a stationary phase， and exhibiting resistance to environmental contaminants. The rich genomic resources， compact genomes， resistance to foreign DNA invasion， wide ecological adaptation， large collections of natural strains and the demonstrated ability to grow on a large scale suggested Nannochloropsis can serve as research models and platform strains for economical and scalable photosynthetic production of fuels and chemicals. To untangle the intricate genome-wide networks underlying the robust biomass accumulation and oil production in Nannochloropsis， we applied high-throughput mRNA-sequencing and reconstructed the structure and dynamics of the genome-wide functional network underlying robust microalgal triacylglycerol (TAG) production in Nannochloropsis oceanica， by tracking the genome-wide， single-base-resolutiontranscript change for the complete time-courses of nitrogen-depletion-induced TAG synthesis.,Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 cells were grown in liquid cultures under continuous light (approximately 50 Âµmol photons m-2 s-1) at 25â and aerated by bubbling with a mixture of 1.5% CO2 in air. Mid-logarithmic phase algal cells were collected and washed three times with axenic seawater. Equal numbers of cells were re-inoculated in nitrogen replete medium (Control condition or C， i.e. N+) and nitrogen deprived medium (N deficiency or N， i.e. N-) with 50Âµmol m-2 s-1 light intensity， respectively. Cell aliquots were collected for RNA isolation after being transferred to the designated conditions for 3h， 4h， 6h， 12h， 24h and 48h. Three biological replicates of algal cultures were established under each of the above âCâ (i.e. N+) and âNâ (i.e. N-) conditions， respectively. In total， 36 samples collected at six time points (3h，4h，6h，12h，24h and 48h) were used for mRNA-Seq library preparation and then submitted to Illumina HiSeq 2000 for sequencing.,24692423,Plant Cell
Full-length TARGET-seq resolves molecular signatures of distinct genetic subclones in MPN patients [full length TARGET-seq patient samples; Figures 3，4],GSE105452,Homo sapiens,We developed TARGET-seq， a single-cell genotyping and RNA-seq method， which allows accurate detection of multiple mutations within single-cells from genomic and coding DNA in parallel with whole transcriptome analysis， providing a powerful tool to link transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity. Single cell whole transcriptome sequencing of Lineage-CD34+ HSPC (Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells) from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and normal controls using full-length TARGET-seq reveals distinct molecular signatures associated with the presence of somatic mutations in single cells as well as distinct transcriptional profiles of WT cells from patient samples as compared with normal controls.,We isolated single HSPCs from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and normal controls using full-length TARGET-seq， a novel method for parallel mutational analysis and whole transcriptome sequencing from the same single cell. We analyzed a cohort of patients with different combinations of JAK2 V617F， TET2 and EZH2 mutations， and performed differential expression analysis between mutant and WT cells from the same patient as well as cells obtained from normal donors.  We also analyzed molecular signatures corresponding to every combination of mutations found in single cell as well as molecular signatures of WT cells from patient samples as compared to WT cells from normal controls.,30765193,Mol Cell

CRISPR-based multimodal genetic screens in human iPSC-derived neurons,GSE124703,Homo sapiens,CRISPR/Cas9-based functional genomics have transformed our ability to elucidate mammalian cell biology. Most previous CRISPR-based screens were implemented in cancer cell lines， rather than healthy， differentiated cells. Here， we describe a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based platform for genetic screens in human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We demonstrate robust and durable knockdown of endogenous genes in such neurons， and present results from three complementary genetic screens. A survival-based screen revealed neuron-specific essential genes and a small number of genes that improved neuronal survival upon knockdown. A screen with a single-cell transcriptomic readout uncovered several examples for genes knockdown of which had dramatically different cell-type specific consequences. A longitudinal imaging screen detected distinct consequences of gene knockdown on neuronal morphology. Our results highlight the potential of interrogating cell biology in iPSC-derived differentiated cell types and provide a platform for the systematic dissection of normal and disease states of neurons.,The Quant-seq experiments were performed using iPSC-derived neurons at Day 14， Day 21 and Day 28 of differentiation with 2 replicates for each sample. The CROP-seq experiments were performed using iPSCs and Day 7 neurons infected by a library of sgRNAs. Two lanes of 10X platform were used for each CROP-seq sample.,31422865,Neuron
Naked mole rat cells show resistance to iPSC reprogramming and signs of more stable epigenome,GSE83585,Mus musculus;Heterocephalus glaber,Naked mole rat (NMR) is a valuable model for aging and cancer research due to its exceptional longevity and resistance to tumorigenesis. In an effort to generate NMR induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) we observed that reprogramming efficiency of NMR fibroblasts in repsonse to OSKM overexpression was drasticaly lower than that of mouse fibroblasts. To understand the cause of NMR resistance to reprogramming we screened for factors that improve reprogramming effciency. We identified that expression of SV40 Large T (LT) dramatically improved reprogramming of NMR fibroblasts. Inactivation of Rb alone， but not p53， was suffcient to improve reprogramming effciency suggesting that NMR chromatin structure is refractory to reprogramming. Analysis of global histone landscape using quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that NMR fibroblasts had higer levels of repressive H3K27 methylation marks， and lower levels of activating H3K27 acetylation mark than the mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore， the NMR cells had lower levels of permissive H2A.Z acetylation marks. ChIP showed that of E-cadherin had repressive H3K9me3 histone mark in the NMR， but was poised with a bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 in the mouse. Expression of LT reduced the levels of H3K9me3 mark on E-cadherin promoter. ATAC-seq revealed that NMR had more open chromatin globally， however， NMR promoters were more closed than mouse promoters. Expression of LT antigen led to massive opening of the NMR promoters including gene promoters required for reprogramming. Cumulatively， these data suggest that NMR has more stable epigenome than mouse， which resists reprogramming and may contribute to NMR longevity and cancer resistance.,ATAC-seq in mouse and naked mole rate fibroblast cell lines.,nan,
Polycomb PRC2 antagonizes de novo DNA methylation at the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus [Next-Gen Sequence Data],GSE59463,Mus musculus,Wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells are compared with mutants for components of PRC2 including  Ezh2-/-， Eed-/-， and Jarid2-/- cells. Chromatin modifications， Gene expression， Pol-II， small-RNA sequencing， and DNA methylation are compared for both cell types.,To study genomic and epigentic control of PRC2 in mESCs， we designed gene expression analysis (RNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq)， combining with ChIP-Seq analysis of several factors and histone marks from wild-type and distinct PRC2 mutants including wild-type， Ezh2-/-， Eed-/-， and Jarid2-/-.,nan,
Genomic deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 reveals a critical role for Evx1as/Evx1 locus in regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation,GSE58801,Mus musculus,We report that head to head long noncoding RNAs contribute to transcription and developmental process. Thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in the whole genome， and classified to several subgroups based on the genome position with their coding neighbors. XH， the head to head subgroup is associated with transcription and development in GO analysis. Here， we deleted the promoter and exon1 region which shared by Evx1as/Evx1 XH pair in embryonic stem cells by two sgRNAs-mediated CRISPR. Two homozygous mutants came out from 46 single clones with high efficiency， while two control clones were picked from cells which were only Cas9 transfected. These two mutants failed to activate Evx1 in -LIF differentiation compared to control cells， while Evx1as still have 30% mRNA residual. Meanwhile， we characterized gene expression level among different stages of ESC differentiation and found many differentiated related makers exhibited aberrant regulation， especially endodermal genes. We propose that XH lncRNA and its coding neighbor could regulate each other， and function as a unit to promote ESC differentiation and biological development.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal the differentially expressed genes between wild-type or Evx1as/Evx1 promoter and exon1 KO cells during -LIF differentiation.,26996597,Cell Stem Cell
iRNA-seq: Computational method for genome wide assessment of acute transcriptional regulation from total RNA-seq data,GSE60462,Homo sapiens,RNA-seq is a sensitive and accurate technique to compare steady state levels of RNA between different cellular states. However， as it does not provide an account of transcriptional activity per se， other technologies are needed to more precisely determine acute transcriptional responses. Here， we have developed an easy， sensitive and accurate novel method， iRNA-seq， for genome-wide assessment of transcriptional activity based on analysis of intron coverage from total RNA-seq data. To test our method， we have performed total RNA-seq and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) ChIP-seq profiling of the acute transcriptional response of human adipocytes to TNFÎ± treatment and analyzed these using iRNA-seq in addition to different publically availbale dataset.  Comparison of the results derived from iRNA-seq analyses with results derived using current methods for genome-wide determination of transcriptional activity， i.e. Global Run-On (GRO)-seq and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) ChIP-seq， demonstrate that iRNA-seq provides very similar results in terms of number of regulated genes and their fold change. However， unlike the current methods that are all very labor-intensive and demanding in terms of sample material and technologies， iRNA-seq is cheap and easy and requires very little sample material.

Assessing characteristics of RNA amplification methods for single cell RNA sequencing,GSE88850,Homo sapiens,We conducted a large-scale control experiment to assess the transfer function of three scRNA-seq methods and factors modulating the function. Our approach was to dilute bulk total RNA (from a single source) to levels bracketing single-cell levels of total RNA (10 pg and 100 pg) in replicates and amplifying the RNA to levels sufficient for RNA sequencing.,We performed replicate transcriptome amplifications of Universal Human Reference RNA (UHR) and Human Brain Reference RNA (HBR) that were diluted to single-cell and ten-cell abundances (10 and 100 picograms (pg.) total RNA or ~200，000 and 2 million mRNA molecules， respectively) and were amplified using three single-cell RNA amplification methods. Methods included the antisense RNA IVT protocol (aRNA)， a custom C1 SMARTer protocol (SmartSeq Plus) performed on a Fluidigm C1 96-well chip， and a modified NuGen Ovation RNA sequencing protocol (NuGen). Bulk ribo-depleted UHR and HBR RNA were sequenced and served as a reference. The general experimental scheme was consistent for all dilution replicates; however， there were differences across experimental groups in the specifics of experimental protocols， necessitated by particular methodologies. Because of these experimental differences， head-to-head comparison of methods is not appropriate and our goal is to provide quantitative analyses of factors affecting individual methods. Current results should be used in experimental planning， data analysis， and method optimization rather than as a performance test of any particular method.Detailed experimental design:Each collaborating center obtained reference RNA with the same lot number for Universal Human Reference (UHR) RNA (Agilent 740000， Lot 0006141415) and Human Brain Reference (HBR) (Ambion AM6050， Lot-105P055201A) and performed replicate amplification using a single amplification method， detailed below.SmartSeq Plus: Reference RNA was diluted to an intermediate stock solution by serial dilution. A final 1000-fold dilution occurred on the C1 chip， such that individual wells in a given batch contained 9.99 pg. sampled from a common intermediate dilution. ERCC spike-in RNA mix 1 (Ambion 4456740) was also added for a final mass of approximately 7 femtograms (fg.) per sample， a 4，000，000x dilution from stock. Samples for each source RNA were prepared in single batches. After amplification， cDNA from the entire C1 96-well plate was quantified using picogreen. C1 chips with an average yield of less than 3 nanograms were discarded. The top 15 reactor wells by cDNA concentration were selected as representative 10 pg. samples for sequencing library preparation. Another 50 wells were selected by the same criteria. These were pooled in sets of 10， generating 5 100 pg. samples for each HBR and UHR. All samples for a given source were prepared in a single sequencing library preparation batch using Nextera XT C1 protocol.NuGen: HBR samples were prepared in a single batch using amplification protocol 1， generating 4 10 pg. and 4 100 pg. amplified replicates. UHR samples were prepared in two batches， using either amplification protocol 1 or 2， generating 15 10 pg. and 11 100 pg. samples. A single sequencing library preparation was performed for each batch of samples using either Lucigen NxSeq or NuGen Ovation Rapid protocol.aRNA: Amplification was performed as previously described (Morris J， Singh JM， Eberwine JH. Transcriptome analysis of single cells. J. Vis. Exp. [Internet]. 2011; Available from:http://www.jove.com/video/2634/transcriptome-analysis-of-single-cells). HBR samples were prepared in 4 batches from separate dilutions of reference RNA， generating 19 10 pg. and 3 100 pg. amplified replicates. ERCC spike-ins were added to 5 of the 10 pg. replicates before amplification at a dilution of 4，000，000x from stock. UHR samples were diluted and amplified in 2 batches from separate dilutions of reference RNA， generating 12 10 pg. and 7 100 pg. amplified replicates. A single sequencing library preparation was performed using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol modified to begin with amplified aRNA. A small numbers of reads were assigned to ERCC transcripts in replicates from the batch where ERCCs had been added that did not have spike-ins added (average of 0.5% of the number of reads assigned in spiked samples). 18 additional HBR 10 pg. replicates were amplified using aRNA for protocol optimization experiments. These samples were treated separately and were excluded from primary analysis.Bulk UHR and HBR: For each reference RNA， three sequencing libraries were generated from bulk material at the same laboratory as the SmartSeq Plus replicates. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were depleted using Ribo-Zero Gold as part of Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA protocol. Samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000.Because of differences in experimental design， direct comparison across methods of precision and the effect of input RNA abundance is difficult. For example， input RNA amount as a factor have different meanings for the different amplification methods: for SmartSeq Plus， because 100pg samples were constructed by pooling 10 pg. samples after cDNA amplification， any resulting effects involve library construction， while for aRNA and NuGen resulting effects reflect both cDNA amplification steps and library steps.,27881084,BMC Genomics

A protective strategy against hyperinflammatory responses requiring the non-transcriptional actions of GPS2,GSE35197,Homo sapiens,The association between hyper-inflammatory states and numerous diseases is widely recognized， but our understanding of the molecular strategies that have evolved to prevent uncontrolled activation of inflammatory responses remains incomplete. Here， we report a critical， non-transcriptional role of GPS2 as a guardian against hyperstimulation of TNFA-induced gene program. GPS2 cytoplasmic actions are required to specifically modulate RIP1 ubiquitylation and JNK activation by inhibiting TRAF2/Ubc13 enzymatic activity. In vivo relevance of GPS2 anti-inflammatory role is confirmed by inhibition of TNFA target genes in macrophages and by improved insulin signaling in the adipose tissue of aP2-GPS2 transgenic mice. As the non-transcriptional role is complemented by GPS2 functioning as positive and negative cofactor for nuclear receptors， in vivo overexpression also results in elevated circulating level of resistin and development of hepatic steatosis. Together， these studies define GPS2 as a molecular guardian required for precise control of inflammatory responses involved in immunity and homeostasis.,RNA-sequencing of polyA selected RNA molecules in 293T cells and ChIP-seq of GPS2， TBL1， and NCOR.,22424771,Mol Cell
Deconstructing Retinal Organoids: single cell RNA-Seq reveals the cellular components of human pluripotent stem cell-derived retina,GSE119893,Homo sapiens,The rapid improvements in single cell sequencing technologies and analyses methods afford greater scope for dissecting organoid cultures composed of multiple cell types and create an opportunity to interrogate these models to understand tissue biology， cellular behaviour and interactions. To this end， retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were analysed by single cell RNA-Sequencing at three time points of differentiation. Combinatorial data from all time points revealed the presence of nine clusters， five of which corresponded to key retinal cell types， namely retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)， retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)， cone and rod photoreceptors and MÃ¼ller glia cells. The remaining four clusters expressed genes typical of mitotic cells， extracellular matrix (ECM) components and those involved in retinal homeostasis. The cell clustering analysis revealed the decreasing presence of mitotic cells and RGCs， formation of a distinct RPE cluster， the emergence of cone and rod photoreceptors from photoreceptor precursors and an increasing number of MÃ¼ller Glia cells over time. The pseudotime analysis resembled the order of cell birth during retinal development， with the mitotic cluster commencing the trajectory and the large majority of MÃ¼ller glia being the latest. Together， these data demonstrate the feasibility and potential of single cell RNA-Seq to dissect the inherent complexity of the organoids and the orderly birth of key retinal cell types.,A hESC (H9) cell line harbouring a CRX-GFP reporter was differentiated to retinal organoids 25. Samples were collected at 60， 90 and 200 days， dissociated， partitioned into single cells using the Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell mRNA-Seq HT IFC and processed for scRNA-Seq.,30548510,Stem Cells

From pioneer to repressor: Bimodal foxd3 activity dynamically remodels neural crest regulatory landscape in vivo,GSE106676,Danio rerio,The neural crest (NC) is a transient embryonic stem cell population characterised by its multipotency and broad developmental potential. Here， we perform NC-specific transcriptional and epigenomic profiling of foxd3-mutant versus wild-type cells in vivo to define the gene regulatory circuits controlling NC specification. Together with global binding analysis obtained by foxd3 biotin-ChIP and single cell profiles of foxd3-expressing premigratory NC， our analysis shows that during early steps of NC formation， foxd3 acts globally as a pioneer factor to prime the onset of genes regulating NC specification and migration by re-arranging the chromatin landscape， opening cis-regulatory elements and reshuffling nucleosomes. Strikingly， foxd3 then gradually switches from an activator to its previously well-described role as a transcriptional repressor.

Deconstructing the dynamic transcriptional program of pluripotent stem cells.,GSE60749,Mus musculus,Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between distinct substates， but the regulatory circuits specifying these states and enabling transitions between them are not well understood. We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs， with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly， either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network， increased self-renewal efficiency， and a distinct chromatin state， an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis. These findings illuminate the causes of transcriptional heterogeneity in PSCs and their consequences for cellular decision-making.,Single-cell RNA-Seq on 183 individual v6.5 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in serum+LIF media， 94 v6.5 mESCs cultured in 2i+LIF media ('ground state' conditions)， and 84 Dgcr8 -/- mESCs (constructed in a v6.5 background)， that lack mature miRNAs due to knockout of a miRNA processing factor， cultured in serum+LIF.

A link between RNA metabolism and silencing affecting Arabidopsis development,GSE11070,Arabidopsis thaliana,Whole genome small RNA sequencing (wild-type Col-0， abh1-1， ein5-6， ein5-6 abh1-1) and 5'-RACE (GMUCT) (wild-type Col-0 and ein5-6) sequencing of parenthetically indicated genotypes of Arabidopsis using the Illumina Genetic Analyzer. Whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays were used for gene expression studies of the entire transcriptome for wildtype Col-0， abh1-1， ein5-6， and ein5-6 abh1-1 plants.Micro (mi)RNAs and small-interfering (si)RNAs are abundant endogenous small (sm)RNAs that control transcript expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Here， we show that concomitant loss of XRN4/EIN5， a 5â-3â exoribonuclease， and CBP80/ABH1， the largest subunit of the mRNA cap binding complex， results in Arabidopsis plants manifesting myriad developmental defects. Through the analysis of ein5 abh1 double mutant plants， we find that CBP80/ABH1 regulates the levels of mature miRNAs， which suggests this protein is a novel component of the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway. Additionally， we show that a novel class of smRNAs are processed from both sense and anti-sense strands of ~130 endogenous transcripts that apparently are converted to double-stranded RNA and subsequently processed into smRNAs， and accumulate in the absence of XRN4/EIN5. Moreover， we demonstrate that accumulation of these smRNAs is often synergistically increased in ein5 abh1 double mutant plants， which suggests that these proteins act coordinately to regulate the substrates from which they are processed. Finally， we find that the parent transcripts of these novel smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5. These results suggest that uncapped endogenous transcripts can shuttle into an RNA silencing pathway where they become smRNA biogenesis substrates. Overall， our results reveal unexpected connections between RNA metabolism and silencing.Keywords: transcriptome analysis using tiling array; whole genome small RNA sequencing; 5'-RACE sequencing,Two biological replicates were done for each of the four genotypes (wild-type Col-0， abh1-1， ein5-6， and ein5-6 abh1-1) for the gene expression studies of the entire transcriptome employing tiling microarrays for the reverse (Crick) and forward (Watson) chromosomal strands， which meant a total of 16 whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays were used for these studies.

Multiplex enhancer-reporter assays uncover unsophisticated p53 enhancer logic [RNA-seq],GSE76656,Homo sapiens,Analysis of p53 binding sites using multiplex enhancer reporter assays， ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data.Transcription factors establish and maintain the specific transcriptome of a cell by binding to genomic regulatory regions， thereby regulating the transcription of their target genes. Like many transcription factors， the DNA sequence-specific binding preferences of p53 are known. However， it remains largely unclear what distinguishes functional enhancers from other bound genomic regions that have no regulatory activity. In addition， the genome is scattered with seemingly perfect recognition sequences that remain unoccupied. To disentangle the rules of genome-wide p53 binding， we employed two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays， one using barcoded reporters and the other using enhancer self-transcription. We compared the activity of more than one thousand candidate p53 enhancers under loss and gain of p53 conditions and identified several hundred high-confidence p53-responsive enhancers. Strikingly， the large majority (99%) of these target enhancers can be characterized and distinguished from negative sequences by the occurrence of a single p53 binding site. By training a machine learning classifier on these data， and integrating the resulting genome-wide predictions with fifteen publicly available human p53 ChIP-seq data sets， we identified a consensus set of 1148 functional p53 binding sites in the human genome. Unexpectedly， this direct p53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions， while differences between experiments can be largely attributed to indirect non-functional binding. Our data suggest that direct p53 enhancers function in a context-independent manner and do not contain obvious combinatorial complexity of binding sites for multiple transcription factors. They represent a class of unsophisticated cell-autonomous enhancers with a single binding site， distinct from complex developmental enhancers that integrate signals from multiple transcription factors. This suggests that context-dependent regulation of p53 target genes is not encoded in the p53 enhancer， but at different upstream or downstream layers of the cell's gene regulatory network.,RNA-seq on MCF7 cells with p53 stable knockdown.,27197205,Genome Res

RNA-Seq Revealed Differences in Transcriptomes between 3ADON and 15ADON Populations of Fusarium graminearum,GSE83735,Fusarium graminearum,Fusarium graminearum is the major causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in North America and other regions of the world. The pathogen causes direct yield losses and produces various types of trichothecenes mycotoxins [Deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated forms (3-acetyl-4-deoxynivalenol=3ADON and 15-acetyl-4-deoxvevalenol=15ADON)， nivalenol (NIV). Recent studies indicated that 3ADON-type isolates were significantly increased in North America and China in recent years and appears to be more aggressive based on growth rate， disease severity on different cultivars， and DON production in vitro. Thus the overall objective of this this study was to understand the molecular mechanisms that make 3ADON- and 15ADON-type populations different during infection using a susceptible cultivar， and to compare the transcriptomes of the 3ADON- and 15ADON-type populations in vitro and in planta using the RNA-seq approach as well as to identify the expression differences of candidate genes related to aggressiveness and DON production.,Experimental samples were collected from in-vitro and in-planta inoculations with Fusarium graminearum isolates producing different mycotoxin derivatives. In in-vitro， Mung Bean Media was inoculated with a mix of 10 isolates of either 3ADON or 15ADON isolate population， incubated for five days and harvested to extract RNA. While for in planta， a susceptible spring wheat cultivar- Briggs was point inoculated at the flowering stage by both populations separately. The samples were collected at 48， 96 and 144 hours after plant inoculation. In both cases， samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to power for RNA extraction using Promega SV total RNA isolation kit. Extracted RNA was converted dscDNA and used for library preparation and sequencing using TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit from Illumina.,27788144,PLoS One

ALS implicated protein TDP-43 sustains levels of STMN2 a mediator of motor neuron growth and repair,GSE121569,Homo sapiens,The discovery that TDP-43 mutations cause familial ALS and that many patients display pathological TDP-43 mislocalization has nominated altered RNA metabolism as a potential disease mechanism. Despite its importance， the identity of RNAs regulated by TDP-43 in motor neurons remains poorly understood. Here， we report transcripts whose abundances in human motor neurons are sensitive to TDP-43 depletion. Notably， we found STMN2， which encodes a microtubule regulator， declined after TDP-43 knockdown， in patient-specific motor neurons， following TDP-43 mislocalization， and in the postmortem patient spinal cords. Loss of STMN2 upon reduced TDP-43 function was due to the emergence of a cryptic exon， which is of substantial functional importance， as we further demonstrate that STMN2 is necessary for both axonal outgrowth and repair. Importantly， post-translational stabilization of STMN2 could rescue neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration deficits induced by TDP-43 depletion.  We propose restoring STMN2 expression warrants future examination as an ALS therapeutic strategy.,Transcriptome differential expression analysis in HUES3 cells with and without siRNA knockdown of TDP-43,30643292,Nat Neurosci

RNAseq of pre-T cells from control and Zfp36l1， Zfp36l2 double conditional knockout mice.,GSE79174,Mus musculus,Purpose: Conditional knockout of Zfp36l1 Zfp36l2 early in lymphocyte development leads to a bypass of beta-selection and subsequently T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This RNA seq experiment aimed to determine the molecular pathways affected by loss of Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2， and to deduce direct targets of these RNA binding proteins.Methods: RNA was isolated from sorted Zfp36l1fl/fl; Zfp36l2fl/fl DN3a (Lineage-negative， CD44-， Kitlow， CD25+， CD98low) and DN3b (Lineage-negative， CD44-， Kitlow， CD25intermediate， CD98+) cells as well as Zfp36l1fl/fl; Zfp36l2fl/fl; CD2cre DN3 (Lineage-negative， CD44-， Kitlow， CD25+) cells with the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). RNAseq libraries were prepared from 20-200ng RNA using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA and rRNA Removal Mix â Gold from Illumina. Libraries were sequenced by Hiseq in 100bp single-end reads. The reads were trimmed to remove adapter sequences using Trim Galore then mapped using Tophat (version 2.0.12) to the GRCm38 mouse assembly; reads with an identical sequence to more than one genomic locus were not mapped.  Quality control analysis was carried out with FastQC.  Reads were counted using htseq-count tool and mouse gtf file version 78.Results:  Differences in the abundance of transcripts between DCKO and control samples were calculated in the R/Bioconductor program DESeq2 (version 1.6.3).  Adjusted P values for differential expression were calculated in DESeq2 using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction: genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 5% were considered significant.

Arid1a loss drives nonâalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice via epigenetic dysregulation of hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation,GSE124694,Mus musculus,ARID1A， a DNA-binding component of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex， contributes to nucleosome repositioning and access by transcriptional regulators. Liver-specific deletion of Arid1a (Arid1a LKO) caused the development of age-dependent fatty liver disease in mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of lipogenesis and down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation genes.,Livers of P90-day-old mice were collected， and transcriptomic analysis performed via RNA-seq.,30584660,Hepatology
DNase I hypersensitivity and algorithmic prediction of TF binding in early pancreatic mES directed differentiation,GSE53776,Mus musculus,This dataset uses DNase-seq to profile the genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity of mES and mES-derived cells along an early pancreatic lineage and provides the locations of putative Transcription Factor (TF) binding sites using the PIQ algorithm. DNase-seq takes advantage of the preferential cutting of DNase I in open chromatin and steric blockage of of DNase I by tightly bound TFs that protect associated genomic DNA sequences. After deep sequencing of DNase Iâdigested genomic DNA from intact nuclei， genome-wide data on chromatin accessibility as well as TF-specific DNase I protection profiles that reveal the genomic binding locations of a majority of TFs are obtained. Such TF signature âDNase profilesâ reflect the effect of the TF on DNA shape and local chromatin architecture， extending hundreds of base pairs from a TF binding site， and these profiles are centered on âDNase footprintsâ at the binding motif itself， which reflects the biophysics of protein-DNA binding. An algorithm， PIQ， is then applied that models the specific profile of each factor， and in combination with sequence information predicts the likely binding locations of over 700 TFs genome wide.,This dataset includes DNase-seq hypersensitivity data from 6 mES-derived cell types: mESC， Mesendoderm， Mesoderm， Endoderm， Intestinal Endoderm， and Prepancreatic Endoderm. For each cell type， TF binding site predictions are made based on the identification TF-specific DNase-seq profiles over any of 1331 possible binding motifs. After significance thesholding， genome-wide binding site predictions for <700 TFs are included.,24441470,Nat Biotechnol
Systematic reconstruction of molecular cascades regulating growth plate development using single-cell RNA-seq,GSE76157,Mus musculus,The growth plate， which comprises sequentially differentiated cell layers， is a critical structure for bone elongation and regeneration. Although several key regulators in growth plate development have been identified using primarily genetic perturbation， the systematic understanding is still limited. Here we used single cell RNA-seq to interrogate gene expression profiles of 217 single cells from growth plates， and developed the bioinfromatics pipeline Sinova to de-novo reconstruct physiological growth plate development in both temporal and spatial high-resolution. Our unsupervised model not only confirmed prior knowledge but also enabled systematic discovery of novel genes， potential signal pathways and surface markers CD9/CD200 to precisely depict the development. Sinova further identified effective transcriptional factor portfolio directing growth plate maturation， which was cross-validated experimentally using an in-vitro EGFP-Col10a screening system. Our case demonstrated systematic reconstructing of molecular cascades of a developmental process from single-cell profiling， and the workflow is readily transferable to other physiological scenarios.,217 single-cell RNA-seq for cell isolated from mouse growth plate at postnatal day7,27160914,Cell Rep
Deep RNA sequencing of the human placental transcriptome,GSE77085,Homo sapiens,The goal of this study was to conduct an in-depth analysis of the human placental transcriptome. RNA was extracted from 16 placental samples using TRIzol following the manufacturerâs protocol. All samples were spiked with 96 External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) ExFold RNA transcripts. Ribosomal RNAs were depleted from samples using Ribo-Zero Gold and sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation kits. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 using a 100bp paired-end protocol. Sequence adapters were trimmed using AdapterRemoval with options --trimns， --minlength 20. Trimmed RNA-Seq reads were aligned to known UCSC hg19 genes and the hg19 genome using Bowtie 2 v2.1.0 and TopHat v2.0.9 with options --library-type=fr-firststrand --mate-inner-dist -20 --mate-std-dev 180. UCSC hg19 reference genome and transcriptome was obtained through Illumina iGenomes (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html). Aligned RNA-Seq reads were summarised using the summarizeOverlaps algorithm with the UCSC known genes hg19 GTF file using the the options overlapMode=``Union''， ignoreStrand=FALSE， singleEnd=FALSE， fragments=TRUE to generate a table of unique read counts per gene for each sample. All samples were processed in the same way， with all sequencing libraries created in the same batch and sequenced together.,Villous tissue from 16 human placental samples were profiled by total RNA-Seq.,28049421,BMC Genomics

Differential RNA-Seq (dRNA-seq)  of Staphylococcus epidermidis PS2 and PS10 isolates,GSE126097,Staphylococcus epidermidis,We performed differential RNA-seq of two StaphylococcusÂ epidermidis clinical isolates (PS2 and PS10) to compare their transcription profiles. The isolates were originally obtained from blood cultures during a systemic infection in an immunocompromised patient (Weisser et al. 2010. J Clin Microbiol 48: 2407-2412). They are of clonal origin， but differ phenotypically with respect to extracellular biofilm matrix production. Thus PS2， isolated in the early stage of the infection， forms a weak biofilm mediated by protein-protein interactions， while PS10， which was obtained at the end of the infection course， forms a strong biofilm through production of a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) extracellular biofilm matrix. Transcription profiling by dRNA-seq was performed to elucidate differentially expressed metabolic pathways and regulators contributing to the switch in extracellular biofilm matrix producction between the two isolates.,Exponentially growing S. epidermidis PS2 and PS10 isolates were subjected to dRNA-seq. A detailed analysis of the transcriptome focusing on metabolic gene expression was performed,30870530,PLoS Pathog
Iron-responsive chromatin remodelling and MAPK signalling enhance adhesion in Candida albicans,GSE55819,Candida albicans,Recent cumulative data shows that various transcription factors are recruited to the chromatin in an iron-responsive manner to affect diverse cellular functions in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Here， we identified groups of iron-responsive genes in C. albicans by chromatin remodeling analysis at gene promoters， using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion followed by deep sequencing. Chromatin in the promoter regions of iron uptake and utilization genes showed repressed and active configuration， respectively， under iron-replete conditions. GO Term enrichment analysis of genes with differentially remodeled chromatin， in respective promoter locales， suggested that many genes involved in adhesion are also iron-responsive. C. albicans was observed to be more self-adherent (2-fold increase) and formed higher biofilm mass (77% increase) in the presence of iron. Furthermore， we identified various known and novel adhesion-related genes with iron-dependent active chromatin profiles that are indicative of potential up-regulation under iron-replete conditions. Transcription factor Cph1 that is activated upon Cek1 phosphorylation also showed an active chromatin profile under iron-replete conditions and cells showed iron-responsive Cek1 MAPK phosphorylation in the presence of iron. Thus， iron affects diverse biological functions by modulating chromatin profiles of large gene sets and by signaling through Cek1 MAPK in C. albicans.,Two matched MNase-seq replicates in the presence and absence of iron in the media.,24889932,Mol Microbiol

Assessment of a highly multiplexed RNA sequencing platform and comparison to existing high-throughput gene expression profiling techniques [3pDGE],GSE118798,Homo sapiens,In this study， we report the performance of one such technique denoted as sparse full length sequencing (SFL)， a ribosomal RNA depletion-based RNA sequencing approach that allows for the simultaneous sequencing of 96 samples and higher.  We offer comparisons to well established single-sample techniques， including: full coverage Poly-A capture RNA-seq and microarray， as well as another low-cost highly multiplexed technique known as 3â digital gene expression (3â DGE). Data was generated for a set of exposure experiments on immortalized human lung epithelial (AALE) cells in a two-by-two study design， in which samples received both genetic and chemical perturbations of known oncogenes/tumor suppressors and lung carcinogens.  SFL demonstrated improved performance over 3â DGE in terms of coverage， power to detect differential gene expression， and biological recapitulation of patterns of differential gene expression from in vivo lung cancer mutation signatures.,3' Digital Gene Expression (3'DGE) for immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (AALE) exposed to chemical and genotypic perturbations,30891063,Front Genet
Transcriptomic analysis of strains evolved for anaerobic xylose utilization [Y223_Y127_Y128],GSE92907,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Engineering microbes with novel metabolic properties is a critical step for production of biofuels and biochemicals. Synthetic biology enables identification and engineering of metabolic pathways into microbes; however， knowledge of how to reroute cellular regulatory signals and metabolic flux remains lacking. Here we used network analysis of multi-omic data to dissect the mechanism of anaerobic xylose fermentation， a trait important for biochemical production from plant lignocellulose. We compared transcriptomic， proteomic， and phosphoproteomic differences across a series of strains evolved to ferment xylose under various conditions.,RNA-seq and transcriptome analysis of three evolved S. cerevisiae strains (Y22-3， Y127， Y128) grown aerobically or anaerobically in rich lab media with glucose， xylose， galactose， or sorbitol.

Modeling the Neuropathology of Tuberous Sclerosis with Human Stem Cells Reveals a Role for Inflammation and Angiogenic Growth Factors [Treatment],GSE78960,Homo sapiens,Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease characterized by mTOR hyperfunction induced benign tumor growths in multiple organs and neurological symptoms. Because the molecular pathology is highly complex and the etiology poorly understood we employed a defined human neuronal model with a single mTOR activating mutation to dissect the disease-relevant molecular responses driving the neuropathology. TSC2 deficient neural stem cells showed severely reduced neuronal functional maturation and characteristics of astrogliosis instead. Accordingly， transcriptome analysis uncovered an inflammatory response and increased metabolic activity， while ribosome profiling revealed excessive translation of ribosomal transcripts and higher synthesis rates of angiogenic growth factors. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors corrected translational alterations but not transcriptional dysfunction. These results extend our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of TSC brain lesions， and suggest phenotype-tailored pharmacological treatment strategies.,Rapamycin， AZD-8055， and DMSO were given to two TSC+/+ cell lines and two TSC-/- cell lines after six weeks of differentiation. Cells are harvested after 3 hours treatment and are subject to ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis.,27655340,Genome Med
Evx1as and EVX1 knockouts by CRISPR,GSE70419,Mus musculus,We report that long noncoding RNAs contribute to transcription and developmental process. Thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in the whole genome， and tend to located closely to protein-coding genes. To study position relationship between lncRNA and protein-coding genes， we classified all of lncRNA to several subgroups based on the genome position with their coding neighbors. XH， the head to head subgroup is associated with transcription and development in GO analysis. Here， we knockdown serveral XH lncRNA by shRNA in embryonic stem cells and induce nondirectional differnetiation by removing LIF or neural differnetiation by RA. Knockdown of XH lncRNAs led to uniform downregulation of nearby coding genes， and form regulatory circuits with its nearby coding genes to fine-tune embryonic lineage development. In addition， we also knockout one lncRNA-Evx1as and its nearby protein-coding gene-EVX1 by CRISPR， and get similar results as knockdown.We propose that XH lncRNA may function primarily as 'cis-regulators' of the expression of nearby protein-coding genes， and tend to participate in transcriptional or development regulations as their coding neighbors.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal the differentially expressed genes between wild-type and XH lncRNA knockdown/knockout ESCs during differentiation.,26996597,Cell Stem Cell
Insight into novel RNA-binding activities via large-scale analysis of lncRNA-bound proteome and IDH1-bound transcriptome,GSE119798,Mus musculus,RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play pivotal roles in directing RNA fate and function. Yet the current annotation of RBPs is largely limited to proteins carrying known RNA-binding domains. To systematically reveal dynamic RNA-protein interactions， we surveyed the human proteome by a protein array-based approach and identified 671 proteins with RNA-binding activity. Among these proteins， 525 lack annotated RNA-binding domains and are enriched in transcriptional and epigenetic regulators， metabolic enzymes， and small GTPases. Using an improved CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) method， we performed genome-wide target profiling of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)， a novel RBP. IDH1 binds to thousands of RNA transcripts with enriched functions in transcription and chromatin regulation， cell cycle and RNA processing. Purified IDH1， but not an oncogenic mutant， binds directly to GA- or AU-rich RNA that are also enriched in IDH1 CLIP targets. Our study provides useful resources of unconventional RBPs and IDH1-bound transcriptome， and convincingly illustrates， for the first time， the in vivo and in vitro RNA targets and binding preferences of IDH1， revealing an unanticipated complexity of RNA regulation in diverse cellular processes.,Transcriptome-wide profiling of IDH1 RNA targets in mESCs.,30698743,Nucleic Acids Res
Integrative genomics outlines a biphasic glucose response and a ChREBP-RORÎ³ axis regulating proliferation in Î²-cells,GSE81628,Rattus norvegicus,Glucose is an important regulator of pancreatic Î²-cell function. In addition to the acute stimulation of insulin secretion， glucose stimulates long-term adaptive changes in gene expression that can either promote or antagonize the proliferative potential and function of Î²-cells. The glucose-sensing transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) has been shown to promote both Î²-cell proliferation and dysfunction; however， the molecular mechanisms underlying these pleiotropic effects of ChREBP and glucose are not well understood. Here， we have generated time-resolved profiles of enhancer and transcriptional activity in response to glucose in the INS-1E pancreatic Î²-cell line. Our data outline a biphasic response with a first wave during which metabolic genes are activated， and a second wave where cell cycle genes are induced and Î²-cell identity genes are repressed. We show that ChREBP directly activates first wave genes， whereas repression and activation of second wave genes by ChREBP is indirect. By integrating motif enrichment within late-regulated enhancers with expression profiles of the associated transcription factors， we identify multiple putative regulators of the second wave， including RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR) Î³， which we demonstrate is a novel direct ChREBP target gene. Importantly， we show that RORÎ³ activity is necessary for full glucose-induced proliferation of both INS-1E and primary rat Î²-cells.,Genome-wide assesment of the  transcriptional response to glucose in INS-1E Î²-cells using RNA- ChIP- and DNase-seq,27545881,Cell Rep
Rapid recapitulation of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis upon loss of HCF-1 function in mouse hepatocytes [ChIP-seq],GSE115767,Mus musculus,Background and Aims: Host-cell factor 1 (HCF-1)， encoded by the ubiquitously expressed X linked gene Hcfc1， is an epigenetic co-regulator important for mouse development and cell proliferation， including during liver regeneration. Here， we examine the role of HCF-1 in adult tissue physiology using， as model， the resting mouse liver. Methods: We used a hepatocyte-specific inducible Hcfc1 knock-out allele (called Hcfc1hepKO)， to induce HCF-1 loss in hepatocytes of hemizygous Hcfc1 hepKO/Y males by four days. In heterozygous Hcfc1hepKO/+ females， owing to random X-chromosome inactivation， upon Hcfc1hepKO allele induction， a 50/50 mix of HCF-1 positive and negative hepatocyte clusters is engineered. Results: The livers with Hcfc1hepKO/Y hepatocytes displayed a 21 24-day terminal non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) disease progression typical of severe NAFL disease (NAFLD). In contrast， in livers with heterozygous Hcfc1hepKO/+ hepatocytes， HCF-1-positive hepatocytes replaced HCF-1-negative hepatocytes and revealed only mild-NAFL development. Loss of HCF-1 led to loss of PGC1 alpha protein levels， probably owing to its destabilization， and deregulation of gene expression particularly of genes involved in mitochondrial structure and function， likely explaining the severe Hcfc1hepKO/Y liver pathology. Interestingly， although HCF-1 binds to over 5000 transcriptional start sites in the resting liver， expression of only a minor subset of the associated genes was affected by HCF-1 loss. Conclusion: HCF-1 is essential for proper liver physiology likely playing both transcriptional and non-transcriptional roles. These genetically-engineered loss-of-HCF-1 mice represent models for the study of NASH and NAFLD resolution.,Mouse liver from Male KO were subjected to HCF1 ChIP and then sequenced at day zero and day four after Tamoxifen injection.

DNA (de)methylation in embryonic stem cells controls CTCF-dependent chromatin boundaries,GSE114599,Mus musculus,Coordinated changes of DNA (de)methylation， nucleosome positioning and chromatin binding of the architectural protein CTCF play an important role for establishing cell type specific chromatin states during differentiation. To elucidate molecular mechanisms that link these processes we studied the perturbed DNA modification landscape in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carrying a double knockout (DKO) of the Tet1 and Tet2 dioxygenases. These enzymes are responsible for the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into its hydroxymethylated (5hmC)， formylated (5fC) or carboxylated (5caC) forms. We determined changes in nucleosome positioning， CTCF binding， DNA methylation and gene expression in DKO ESCs， and developed biophysical models to predict differential CTCF binding. Methylation-sensitive nucleosome repositioning accounted for a significant portion of CTCF binding loss in DKO ESCs， while unmethylated and nucleosome-depleted CpG islands were enriched for CTCF sites that remained occupied. A number of CTCF sites also displayed direct correlations with the CpG modification state: CTCF was preferentially lost from sites that were marked with 5hmC in wild type cells but not from 5fC enriched sites. In addition， we found that some CTCF sites can act as bifurcation points defining the differential methylation landscape. CTCF loss from such sites， e.g. at promoters， boundaries of chromatin loops and topologically associated domains (TADs)， was correlated with DNA methylation/demethylation spreading and can be linked to downregulation of neighbouring genes. Our results reveal a hierarchical interplay between cytosine modifications， nucleosome positions and DNA sequence that determines differential CTCF binding and regulates gene expression.,Two WT and two Tet1/2-deficient (DKO) mouse ES cell lines were isolated from WT and Tet1/Tet2 double-mutant mice with a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background as described (Daw+B1laty et al.， 2013). ESCs were maintained in regular ESC medium (KnockOut DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum， 1x non-essential amino acids， 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin， 2 mM L-glutamine， 0.0008% Î²-mercaptoethanol and 1000 U/ml leukemia inhibiting factor) at 37 Â°C and 7% CO2 on inactivated MEF feeders seeded on gelatin (0.2%) coated dishes. For CTCF ChIP-seq experiments cells were trypsinized and pre-plated on gelatin coated dishes three times to remove feeders. ESCs were resuspended in medium， fixated for 10 min at room temperature and lysed as described (Wiehle and Breiling 2016). After nuclei lysis， samples were sonicated 4 Ã 5 min with 30 s on/off intervals (Bioruptor， Diagenode). SDS content was reduced by dilution as described (Wiehle and Breiling 2016). Chromatin from 6 x 10^6 cells was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4Â°C using 5 Âµg of antibody against CTCF (#61311， Active Motif). Further processing occurred according to instructions of the ChIP-IT High Sensitivity kit (Active Motif). Immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted from Protein A/G agarose beads and purified using the IPure kit (Diagenode). For ChIP-sequencing libraries were generated from 10 ng of DNA using the NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set (NEB) according to the manufacturerÂ´s instructions. Final libraries were quality controlled and pooled to equimolar amounts and sequenced in 50 bp single-read mode on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 device. For MNase-assisted histone H3 ChIP-seq cells were cross-linked with 1% methanol-free formaldehyde for 10 min. After quenching with glycine， cells were washed three times with PBS. The cell pellet was treated with 40 U MNase for 5 min at 37Â°C， then stopped with 10x Covaris buffer (Covaris Ltd) and chromatin was sheared for 15 min with the Covaris S2 device (burst 200; cycle 20%; intensity 8).  Immunoprecipitation was performed for ~5 x 10^6 cells with anti-H3 antibody (Abcam #ab1791， Lot: GR103864-1). Then chromatin was treated with RNaseA and proteinase K. Purified DNA was cloned into Illumina libraries with the NEBNext Ultra library preparation kit (NEB).,30948436,Genome Res

The RNA helicase UPF1 associates with mRNAs cotranscriptionally,GSE116808,Drosophila melanogaster,UPF1 is an ATP-driven RNA helicase required for efficient nonsense mediated mRNA decay in eukaryotes. Although it is currently understood that UPF1 primarily acts on the 3âUTR of translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm， our data indicates that this is a highly dynamic protein that is rapidly shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm in Drosophila. Additionally， ChIP-seq analysis in different cell types demonstrates genome-wide association of UPF1 with nascent RNAs at most of the active Pol II transcription sites， and at some specific Pol III genes. Notably， intron recognition appears to interfere with association and translocation of UPF1 on nascent transcripts. Cells depleted of UPF1 show defects in nuclear processes such as mRNA export and transcription site retention. These data， thus redefine UPF1 as a global player in mRNA based processes in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.,Refer to individual Series,30907728,Elife
Splicing enhances recruitment of methyltransferase HYPB/Setd2 and methylation of histone H3 lysine 36,GSE30902,Homo sapiens,Several lines of recent evidence support a role for chromatin in splicing regulation. Here we show that splicing can also contribute to histone modification， which implies a bidirectional communication between epigenetics and RNA processing. Genome-wide analysis of histone methylation in human cell lines and mouse primary T cells reveals that intron-containing genes are preferentially marked with H3K36me3 relative to intronless genes. In intron-containing genes， H3K36me3 marking is proportional to transcriptional activity， whereas in intronless genes H3K36me3 is always detected at much lower levels. Furthermore， splicing inhibition impairs recruitment of H3K36 methyltransferase HYPB/Setd2 and reduces H3K36me3， whereas splicing activation has the opposite effect. Moreover， the increase of H3K36me3 correlates with the length of the first intron， consistent with the view that splicing enhances H3 methylation. We propose that splicing is mechanistically coupled to recruitment of HYPB/Setd2 to elongating RNA Polymerase II.,This experiment proposes to profile genome-wide binding profiles by ChIP-seq (Illumina， 36 bp tags) of RNA polymerase II (one biological replicate)， the histone modification H3K36me3 (2 replicates) and a reference control input sample (genomic DNA after reverse cross-link， one replicate) in a human H1299 lung carcinoma cell line*** Raw data not provided for Samples GSM766322-GSM766324.,21792193,Nat Struct Mol Biol
Decoding the regulatory landscape of melanoma reveals TEADS as regulators of the invasive cell state.,GSE60665,Homo sapiens,Understanding the molecular processes underlying intra-tumor heterogeneity is of critical importance to improve the efficiency of therapy and overcome drug resistance. In malignant melanoma， heterogeneity is though to arise -at least partly- through epigenetic rather than genetic reprogramming of proliferating cells， leading to the appearance within the primary tumors of a phenotypically distinct invasive cell subpopulation. The invasive melanoma cells are at the origin of metastatic spread and are thought to provide a reservoir of therapeutically resistant cells. To decipher the gene regulatory networks that underlie the proliferative and invasive cellular states we integrated publicly available gene expression and DNA methylation data from tumor biopsies with a newly generated compendium of open chromatin and histone modification profiling of melanoma cultures that are dominant in either of the two subpopulations. Extensive in silico analyses identified SOX10 and MITF， and AP-1 and TEADs as key upstream regulators of the proliferative and invasive transcriptomes， respectively. Knock-down experiments confirmed the implication of TEADs in the invasive gene network and， more importantly， established a causative link between activation of these transcription factors and melanoma cell invasion and sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors.,Investigation of the epigenomic landscape of 11 melanoma cultures by using FAIRE-seq to map the open chromatin regions,25865119,Nat Commun
Genomic profiling of lymphomas in Canis lupus familiaris,GSE41917,Canis lupus familiaris,Comparative oncology is a developing research discipline that is being used to assist our understanding of human neoplastic diseases.  Companion canines are a preferred animal oncology model due to spontaneous tumor development and similarity to human disease at the pathophysiological level. We use a paired RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)/microarray analysis of a set of four normal canine lymph nodes and ten canine lymphoma fine needle aspirates to identify technical biases and variation between the technologies and convergence on biological disease pathways.   Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) provides a formal multivariate analysis of the combined RNA-Seq/microarray data set. Applying SVA to the data allows us to decompose variation into contributions associated with transcript abundance， differences between the technology， and latent variation within each technology. A substantial and highly statistically significant component of the variation reflects transcript abundance， and RNA-Seq proved more sensitive for detection of transcripts expressed at low levels. Latent random variation among RNA-Seq samples is also distinct in character from that impacting microarray samples. In particular， we observed variation between RNA-Seq samples that reflects transcript GC content. Platform-independent variable decomposition without a priori knowledge of the sources of variation using SVA represents a generalizable method for accomplishing cross-platform data analysis.    We identified genes differentially expressed between normal lymph nodes of disease free dogs and a subset of the diseased dogs diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma using each technology. There is statistically significant overlap between the RNA-Seq and microarray sets of differentially expressed genes. Analysis of overlapping genes in the context of biological systems suggests elevated expression and activity of PI3K signaling in B-cell lymphoma biopsies compared with normal biopsies， consistent with literature describing successful use of drugs targeting this pathway in lymphomas.,RNA was extracted from 10 lymphoma fine needle aspirates attained from companion canines. 4 normal lymph node samples were obtained from a Beagle breeding colony at Pfizer， including two samples that were taken from the same dog but different lymph nodes.This Series represents the Affymetrix gene expression only， not RNA-Seq referenced above.

A multi-step transcriptional and chromatin cascade underlies motor neuron programming (ATAC-Seq),GSE80511,Mus musculus,Direct programming via the overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) aims to control cell fate at a precision that will be instrumental for clinical applications. However， direct programming of terminal fates remains an obscure process. Taking advantage of the rapid and uniquely efficient programming of spinal motor neurons by overexpression of Ngn2， Isl1 and Lhx3， we have characterized gene expression， chromatin and transcription factor binding time-course dynamics during complete motor neuron programming. Our studies point to a surprisingly dynamic programming process. Promoter chromatin and expression analysis reveals at least three distinct phases of gene activation， while programming factor binding shifts from one set of targets to another， controlling regulatory region activity and gene expression. Furthermore， our evidence suggest that the enhancers and genes activated in the final stage of motor neuron processing are dependent on the combined activities of Isl1 and Lhx3 factors with Ebf and Onecut TFs that are themselves activated midway through the programming process. Our results suggest an unexpected multi-stage model of motor neuron programming in which the programming TFs require activation of a set of intermediate regulators before they complete the programming process.,50，000 cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS buffer.

RUNX super-enhancer control through the Notch pathway by Epstein-Barr virus transcription factors regulates B cell growth,GSE76869,Homo sapiens,In B cells infected by the cancer-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)， RUNX3 and RUNX1 transcription is manipulated to control cell growth. The EBV-encoded EBNA2 transcription factor (TF) activates RUNX3 transcription leading to RUNX3-mediated repression of the RUNX1 promoter and the relief of RUNX1-directed growth repression. We show that EBNA2 activates RUNX3 through a specific element within a -97 kb super-enhancer in a manner dependent on the expression of the Notch DNA-binding partner RBP-J. We also reveal that the EBV TFs EBNA3B and EBNA3C contribute to RUNX3 activation in EBV-infected cells by targeting the same element. Uncovering a counter-regulatory feed-forward step， we demonstrate EBNA2 activation of a RUNX1 super-enhancer (-139 to -250 kb) that results in low-level RUNX1 expression in cells refractory to RUNX1-mediated growth inhibition. EBNA2 activation of the RUNX1 super-enhancer is also dependent on RBP-J. Consistent with the context-dependent roles of EBNA3B and EBNA3C as activators or repressors， we find that these proteins negatively regulate the RUNX1 super-enhancer， curbing EBNA2 activation. Taken together our results reveal cell-type specific exploitation of RUNX gene super-enhancers by multiple EBV TFs via the Notch pathway to fine tune RUNX3 and RUNX1 expression and manipulate B-cell growth.,Examination of EBNA2 protein binding using a monoclonal antibody (PE2) in single ChIP-seq experiments carried out in the human GM12878 EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell line.,26883634,Nucleic Acids Res
Zfp281 Coordinates Opposite Functions of Tet1 and Tet2 for Alternative Pluripotent States [RNA-Seq],GSE81044,Mus musculus,Pluripotent cell identity comprises a spectrum of cell states including naive and primed states， which are typified by mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast-derived stem cells (EpiSCs)， respectively. Here we define a pluripotent cell fate (PCF) gene signature based on RNA-seq analysis associated with naive and primed pluripotency acquisition， and identify Zfp281 as a key transcriptional regulator for primed pluripotency and also as a barrier to achieve the naive pluripotency of both mouse and human ESCs.,RNA sequencing analysis was performed in WT and Zfp281 null mouse embryonic stem cells under different pluripotent culture conditions. RNA-seq Experiments were carry out in two biological replciates. Genome binding/occupancy profiling of Zfp281 was performed in mouse embryonic stem cells by ChIP sequencing.,27345836,Cell Stem Cell
Fbxl19 recruits Rnf20 to CpG Islands and promotes H2B mono-ubiquitination [ChIP-Seq],GSE76569,Mus musculus,Rnf20 catalyzes lysine 120 mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B (H2Bub1) that has been previously invloved in normal differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) and adult stem cells. However，the mechanims underlying by which Rnf20 is recruited to its target chromosomal loci to generate H2Bub1 is still elusive. Here， we reveal that Fbxl19， a CxxC domain-containing protein， physically interacts with Rnf20， guides it preferentially to CpG island-containing target promoters， and thereby promotes mono-ubiqutination of H2B. We first show that up-regulation of Fbxl19 induces the level of global H2Bub1， while down-regulation of Fbxl19 reduces the level of H2Bub1 in mouse ES cells. Our genome-wide target mapping unveils the preferential occupancy of Fbxl19 on CpG island-containing promoters， and we further show that the binding of Fbxl19 is essential for the recruitment of Rnf20 to its target genes and subsequent H2Bub1. Altogether， our results demonstrate that Fbxl19 plays critical roles in the H2Bub1 pathway by recruiting Rnf20 to CGI target genes specifically and selectively.,ChIP sequenicngs were performed for Fbxl19 and H2Bub1 in mouse ES cells. To perform Fbxl19 ChIP-seq we generated Fbxl19-overexpressing flag-biotin tagged clones and selected overexpression (OE)-high (more than 5 fold) and OE-low (sub-endogeous level) clones. Using these two OE-high and OE-low clones， we performed ChIP-seq of Fbxl19 using Streptavidin-conjugated beads. We also conducted H2Bub1 ChIP-seq  under various conditions: normal， differentiation， Fbxl19-OE， Fbxl19-KD， and Fbxl19-KD under differentaiton conditions. Input was also sequenced and used for control.,28453857,Nucleic Acids Res
Genome-wide target profiling of pluripotency-associated long noncoding RNAs by RAT-Seq,GSE101765,Mus musculus,Using RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-Seq)， we profiled the genome-wide binding gene targets for pluripotency-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)， including Platr10 (Osclr8)， Oeblr20， Oplr16， Palr35， Palr34， Peln1， and Peln4. These datasets will help study the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNAs in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency.,A RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-seq) assay [1， 2] was modified to map the genome-wide interacting gene targets for lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in reprogramming of fibroblasts into pluripotency. Cells were collected at different stages of pluripotent reprogramming， including fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [3， 4]. After cross-linking with 2% formaldehyde to fix the lncRNA-chromatin structure， cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0]， 10 mM NaCl， 0.2% NP-40， 1x protease inhibitors). After centrifugation， nuclei were suspended in 1Ã reverse transcription buffer in the presence of 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)， and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS.The gene strand-specific reverse transcription was performed using lncRNA-specific complementary primers in the presence of biotin-dCTP. After 50 min of reverse transcription of Platr10 lncRNA with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific， CA) at 62 C， the reaction was stopped by adding 4Âµl 0.5M EDTA. After nuclear lysis， the chromatin complex was subjected to sonication for 180 s (10 s on and 10 s off) on ice with a Branson sonicator with a 2-mm microtip at 40% output control and 90% duty cycle settings. The biotin-labeled cDNA/chromatin DNA complex was pulled down with biotin-streptavidin magic beads (Invitrogen， CA). After reversing the cross-links and washing with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 65Â°C overnight and treatment with 0.4 Âµg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37Â°C， the genomic DNA that interacts with the lncRNA was extracted and digested by Dpn I， and ligated with the NEBNext adaptors (NEBNextÂ® ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina) to construct the library. The library DNAs were subject to Illumina sequencing (Shanghai Biotechnology， Shanghai).As the controls， the RAT assay was performed for iPSCs and fibroblasts by replacing lncRNA-specific complimentary primers with random primers and constructed a control library for sequencing using the same protocol.To reduce the background， the RAT-Seq data were normalized over the peaks of the control RAT-Seq data that were generated by using random oligonucleotide primers in the RAT assay. For this， differential binding analysis was performed with the DiffBind package using parameters of fold change difference â¥2 and p-value < 0.05， with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1.

Genome-wide target profiling of pluripotency-associated long noncoding RNAs by RAT-Seq,GSE101765,Mus musculus,Using RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-Seq)， we profiled the genome-wide binding gene targets for pluripotency-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)， including Platr10 (Osclr8)， Oeblr20， Oplr16， Palr35， Palr34， Peln1， and Peln4. These datasets will help study the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNAs in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency.,A RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-seq) assay [1， 2] was modified to map the genome-wide interacting gene targets for lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in reprogramming of fibroblasts into pluripotency. Cells were collected at different stages of pluripotent reprogramming， including fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [3， 4]. After cross-linking with 2% formaldehyde to fix the lncRNA-chromatin structure， cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0]， 10 mM NaCl， 0.2% NP-40， 1x protease inhibitors). After centrifugation， nuclei were suspended in 1Ã reverse transcription buffer in the presence of 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)， and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS.The gene strand-specific reverse transcription was performed using lncRNA-specific complementary primers in the presence of biotin-dCTP. After 50 min of reverse transcription of Platr10 lncRNA with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific， CA) at 62 C， the reaction was stopped by adding 4Âµl 0.5M EDTA. After nuclear lysis， the chromatin complex was subjected to sonication for 180 s (10 s on and 10 s off) on ice with a Branson sonicator with a 2-mm microtip at 40% output control and 90% duty cycle settings. The biotin-labeled cDNA/chromatin DNA complex was pulled down with biotin-streptavidin magic beads (Invitrogen， CA). After reversing the cross-links and washing with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 65Â°C overnight and treatment with 0.4 Âµg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37Â°C， the genomic DNA that interacts with the lncRNA was extracted and digested by Dpn I， and ligated with the NEBNext adaptors (NEBNextÂ® ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina) to construct the library. The library DNAs were subject to Illumina sequencing (Shanghai Biotechnology， Shanghai).As the controls， the RAT assay was performed for iPSCs and fibroblasts by replacing lncRNA-specific complimentary primers with random primers and constructed a control library for sequencing using the same protocol.To reduce the background， the RAT-Seq data were normalized over the peaks of the control RAT-Seq data that were generated by using random oligonucleotide primers in the RAT assay. For this， differential binding analysis was performed with the DiffBind package using parameters of fold change difference â¥2 and p-value < 0.05， with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. The adjusted RAT-Seq data were used for mapping the lncRNA target gene interaction network.LncRNAs and controls:1.

Genome-wide target profiling of pluripotency-associated long noncoding RNAs by RAT-Seq,GSE101765,Mus musculus,Using RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-Seq)， we profiled the genome-wide binding gene targets for pluripotency-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)， including Platr10 (Osclr8)， Oeblr20， Oplr16， Palr35， Palr34， Peln1， and Peln4. These datasets will help study the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNAs in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency.,A RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-seq) assay [1， 2] was modified to map the genome-wide interacting gene targets for lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in reprogramming of fibroblasts into pluripotency. Cells were collected at different stages of pluripotent reprogramming， including fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [3， 4]. After cross-linking with 2% formaldehyde to fix the lncRNA-chromatin structure， cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0]， 10 mM NaCl， 0.2% NP-40， 1x protease inhibitors). After centrifugation， nuclei were suspended in 1Ã reverse transcription buffer in the presence of 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)， and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS.The gene strand-specific reverse transcription was performed using lncRNA-specific complementary primers in the presence of biotin-dCTP. After 50 min of reverse transcription of Platr10 lncRNA with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific， CA) at 62 C， the reaction was stopped by adding 4Âµl 0.5M EDTA. After nuclear lysis， the chromatin complex was subjected to sonication for 180 s (10 s on and 10 s off) on ice with a Branson sonicator with a 2-mm microtip at 40% output control and 90% duty cycle settings. The biotin-labeled cDNA/chromatin DNA complex was pulled down with biotin-streptavidin magic beads (Invitrogen， CA). After reversing the cross-links and washing with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 65Â°C overnight and treatment with 0.4 Âµg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37Â°C， the genomic DNA that interacts with the lncRNA was extracted and digested by Dpn I， and ligated with the NEBNext adaptors (NEBNextÂ® ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina) to construct the library. The library DNAs were subject to Illumina sequencing (Shanghai Biotechnology， Shanghai).As the controls， the RAT assay was performed for iPSCs and fibroblasts by replacing lncRNA-specific complimentary primers with random primers and constructed a control library for sequencing using the same protocol.To reduce the background， the RAT-Seq data were normalized over the peaks of the control RAT-Seq data that were generated by using random oligonucleotide primers in the RAT assay. For this， differential binding analysis was performed with the DiffBind package using parameters of fold change difference â¥2 and p-value < 0.05， with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. The adjusted RAT-Seq data were used for mapping the lncRNA target gene interaction network.LncRNAs and controls:1.

These datasets will help study the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNAs in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency.,A RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-seq) assay [1， 2] was modified to map the genome-wide interacting gene targets for lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in reprogramming of fibroblasts into pluripotency. Cells were collected at different stages of pluripotent reprogramming， including fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [3， 4]. After cross-linking with 2% formaldehyde to fix the lncRNA-chromatin structure， cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0]， 10 mM NaCl， 0.2% NP-40， 1x protease inhibitors). After centrifugation， nuclei were suspended in 1Ã reverse transcription buffer in the presence of 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)， and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS.The gene strand-specific reverse transcription was performed using lncRNA-specific complementary primers in the presence of biotin-dCTP. After 50 min of reverse transcription of Platr10 lncRNA with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific， CA) at 62 C， the reaction was stopped by adding 4Âµl 0.5M EDTA. After nuclear lysis， the chromatin complex was subjected to sonication for 180 s (10 s on and 10 s off) on ice with a Branson sonicator with a 2-mm microtip at 40% output control and 90% duty cycle settings. The biotin-labeled cDNA/chromatin DNA complex was pulled down with biotin-streptavidin magic beads (Invitrogen， CA). After reversing the cross-links and washing with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 65Â°C overnight and treatment with 0.4 Âµg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37Â°C， the genomic DNA that interacts with the lncRNA was extracted and digested by Dpn I， and ligated with the NEBNext adaptors (NEBNextÂ® ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina) to construct the library. The library DNAs were subject to Illumina sequencing (Shanghai Biotechnology， Shanghai).As the controls， the RAT assay was performed for iPSCs and fibroblasts by replacing lncRNA-specific complimentary primers with random primers and constructed a control library for sequencing using the same protocol.To reduce the background， the RAT-Seq data were normalized over the peaks of the control RAT-Seq data that were generated by using random oligonucleotide primers in the RAT assay. For this， differential binding analysis was performed with the DiffBind package using parameters of fold change difference â¥2 and p-value < 0.05， with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. The adjusted RAT-Seq data were used for mapping the lncRNA target gene interaction network.LncRNAs and controls:1.

Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS.The gene strand-specific reverse transcription was performed using lncRNA-specific complementary primers in the presence of biotin-dCTP. After 50 min of reverse transcription of Platr10 lncRNA with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific， CA) at 62 C， the reaction was stopped by adding 4Âµl 0.5M EDTA. After nuclear lysis， the chromatin complex was subjected to sonication for 180 s (10 s on and 10 s off) on ice with a Branson sonicator with a 2-mm microtip at 40% output control and 90% duty cycle settings. The biotin-labeled cDNA/chromatin DNA complex was pulled down with biotin-streptavidin magic beads (Invitrogen， CA). After reversing the cross-links and washing with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 65Â°C overnight and treatment with 0.4 Âµg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37Â°C， the genomic DNA that interacts with the lncRNA was extracted and digested by Dpn I， and ligated with the NEBNext adaptors (NEBNextÂ® ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina) to construct the library. The library DNAs were subject to Illumina sequencing (Shanghai Biotechnology， Shanghai).As the controls， the RAT assay was performed for iPSCs and fibroblasts by replacing lncRNA-specific complimentary primers with random primers and constructed a control library for sequencing using the same protocol.To reduce the background， the RAT-Seq data were normalized over the peaks of the control RAT-Seq data that were generated by using random oligonucleotide primers in the RAT assay. For this， differential binding analysis was performed with the DiffBind package using parameters of fold change difference â¥2 and p-value < 0.05， with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1. The adjusted RAT-Seq data were used for mapping the lncRNA target gene interaction network.LncRNAs and controls:1.

Cell type-dependent differential activation of ERK by oncogenic KRAS in human colon cancer and mouse intestinal epithelium,GSE115242,Mus musculus,Mutations activating the KRAS GTPase or the BRAF kinase are frequent in colorectal cancer and are thought to constitutively activate the terminal mitogen-activated protein kinase， ERK. Using mass cytometry， we found graded phosphorylation of ERK anti-correlated with cell differentiation in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids， and unexpectedly this gradient was observed independently of KRAS mutational status. We therefore investigated differentiation-dependent signal transduction elicited by oncogenic KRAS or BRAF in transgenic mouse organoid models. Reporter， single cell transcriptome and mass cytometry analyses showed that transgenic expression of KRASG12V activated ERK in a cell type-specific pattern. Furthermore， expression of oncogenic KRAS induced the formation of RAS-ERK-responsive cells. In contrast， transgenic expression of BRAFV600E triggered high ERK activity and downstream gene expression in all intestinal cell types， followed by epithelial disorganisation. We analysed signal transduction to ERK using single cell-resolved network perturbation data in transgenic organoids. Network reconstruction followed by quantitative modelling revealed that activation of ERK is shaped by cell type-specific MEK to ERK feed forward and negative feedback signalling. We identify dual-specificity phosphatases as candidate modulators of MEK to ERK signal transduction. Our experiments highlight key differences between ERK activity elicited by the BRAF or KRAS oncogenes in colorectal cancer and find unexpected functional heterogeneity in a signalling pathway with fundamental relevance for cancer therapy.,Transgene-inducible mouse intestinal organoids for KRAS， BRAF and CTNNB1 were subjected to single cell RNA-sequencing.,31266962,Nat Commun
CTCF counter-regulates cardiomyocyte development and maturation programs in the embryonic heart [RNA-seq],GSE77588,Mus musculus,Analysis of chromatin architecture suggests that the 3D structure of the genome plays a major role in regulating gene expression， orchestrating the compartmentalization of chromatin and facilitating specific enhancer-promoter interactions. However， the mechanisms that control this structuring of the genome are not fully understood. We have addressed this issue by analyzing the role of CTCF， a major architectural factor in chromatin structure， in the embryonic heart. Loss of CTCF triggered an overall downregulation of the cardiac developmental program， suggesting that CTCF facilitates enhancer-promoter interactions in the developing heart. Detailed analysis of the IrxA gene cluster showed that CTCF loss leads to disruption of the heart-specific regulatory domain that surrounds Irx4， resulting in changes in expression of IrxA cluster genes and neighboring genes. In contrast to the critical role proposed for CTCF in organizing large-scale chromatin domains， our results show that CTCF preferentially mediates local regulatory interactions.,RNAseq of mouse embryonic E10.5 hearts in three conditions: 1) control (labeled as WT)， 2) heterozygous (labeled as HET) and  3) homozygous (labeled as KO).

A multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platform enables systematic dissection of the unfolded protein response,GSE90546,Homo sapiens,Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured.  We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq， which combines droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations， allowing many perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. A genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen identified genes whose depletion perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting ~100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses revealed epistasis among the three UPR branches， bifurcated UPR branch activation between cells subject to the same perturbation， and differential activation of the branches across hits， including a feedback loop between the translocon and the IRE1Î± branch. These studies provide insight into how the three sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex cellular responses.,3 different pooled CRISPR screening experiments were conducted via Perturb-seq,27984733,Cell

Sensitive， high-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq reveals within-clonal transcript-correlations in yeast populations,GSE122392,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within many organisms but few methods have been developed for microbial clonal populations. The yeast genome displays an unusually dense transcript spacing with interleaved and overlapping transcription from both strands， resulting in a minuscule but complex pool of RNA protected by a resilient cell wall. Here， we developed a sensitive， scalable and inexpensive yeast single-cell RNA-seq (yscRNA-seq) method that digitally counts transcript start sites (TSS) in a strand- and isoform-specific manner with unique molecular identifiers (UMI). YscRNA-Seq detects expression of low-abundant， non-coding RNAs and at least half of the protein-coding genome in each cell. From just one single-cell transcriptome experiment of a bulk population， enough heterogeneity is uncovered between individual cells to identify biological associations without the need for perturbation experiments necessary to derive correlations from bulk data. Within cells of a single clonal population， we observe negative expression correlation of sense/antisense pairs while duplicated gene pairs and divergent transcripts co-express. By combining yscRNA-Seq with index sorting， which allows phenotypic characterization， we uncover a linear cell size-dependent change in absolute RNA content. Although we detect an average of ~3.5 molecules per gene， a single cell tends restrict the number of expressed isoforms. Remarkably， there is a highly variable expression within metabolic genes， whose stochastic expression primes cells for fitness benefit towards the corresponding environmental challenge. These findings suggest functional transcript diversity as a mechanism for providing a selective advantage to individual cells within otherwise transcriptionally heterogeneous microbial populations.,Yeast single cell RNA-seq (yscRNA-seq) data for S288c and YJM789 strains,30718850,Nat Microbiol

Assessment of a highly multiplexed RNA sequencing platform and comparison to existing high-throughput gene expression profiling techniques [SFL],GSE118797,Homo sapiens,In this study， we report the performance of one such technique denoted as sparse full length sequencing (SFL)， a ribosomal RNA depletion-based RNA sequencing approach that allows for the simultaneous sequencing of 96 samples and higher.  We offer comparisons to well established single-sample techniques， including: full coverage Poly-A capture RNA-seq and microarray， as well as another low-cost highly multiplexed technique known as 3â digital gene expression (3â DGE). Data was generated for a set of exposure experiments on immortalized human lung epithelial (AALE) cells in a two-by-two study design， in which samples received both genetic and chemical perturbations of known oncogenes/tumor suppressors and lung carcinogens.  SFL demonstrated improved performance over 3â DGE in terms of coverage， power to detect differential gene expression， and biological recapitulation of patterns of differential gene expression from in vivo lung cancer mutation signatures.,Highly-multiplexed RNA-seq for immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (AALE) exposed to chemical and genotypic perturbations,30891063,Front Genet
Nascent RNA and Poly(A) RNA Seq from S2 cells [RNA-seq],GSE116807,Drosophila melanogaster,Nascent RNA and Poly(A) RNA Seq from S2 cellsUPF1 is an ATP-driven RNA helicase required for efficient nonsense mediated mRNA decay in eukaryotes. Although it is currently understood that UPF1 primarily acts on the 3âUTR of translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm， our data indicates that this is a highly dynamic protein that is rapidly shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm in Drosophila. Additionally， ChIP-seq analysis in different cell types demonstrates genome-wide association of UPF1 with nascent RNAs at most of the active Pol II transcription sites， and at some specific Pol III genes. Notably， intron recognition appears to interfere with association and translocation of UPF1 on nascent transcripts. Cells depleted of UPF1 show defects in nuclear processes such as mRNA export and transcription site retention. These data， thus redefine UPF1 as a global player in mRNA based processes in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.,Nascent RNA were isolated from Histone-DNA-Pol II-RNA fraction of S2 cells and poly(A) RNA were isolated from cytoplasmic fraction of S2 Cells.

Xist exploits three-dimensional chromosome architecture to spread across the X-chromosome,GSE46918,Mus musculus,Many large noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin， but the mechanisms by which they localize to genomic targets remain unexplored. Here we investigate the localization mechanisms of Xist during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)， a paradigm of lncRNA-mediated chromatin regulation. During the maintenance of XCI， Xist binds broadly across the X-chromosome.  During initiation of XCI， Xist initially transfers to distal regions across the X-chromosome that are not defined by specific sequences. Instead， Xist identifies these regions by exploiting the three-dimensional conformation of the X-chromosome. Xist initially accumulates on the periphery of actively transcribed regions and requires its silencing domain to spread across active regions. This suggests a model where Xist coats the entire X-chromosome by searching in three dimensions， modifying chromosome structure， and spreading to newly accessible locations.,We examined the genomic localization of the Xist lncRNA using RNA Antisense Purification (RAP) in multiple cell contexts: 1) differentiated female cells (MLFs);  2) a time-course of Xist localization in male embryonic stem (ES) cells where the endogenous Xist promoter is replaced by a tet-inducible one (pSM33); 3) a time-course of Xist localization in differentiating female ES cells (F1 2-1); and 4) wild-type (delXF6) and A-repeat deletion (delSXC9) Xist transgenes incorporated into the Hprt locus under the control of a tet-inducible promoter.,23828888,Science

hnRNPC regulates cancer-specific alternative cleavage and polyadenylation profiles,GSE102357,Homo sapiens,Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) can occur at more than half of all human genes， greatly enhancing the cellular repertoire of mRNA isoforms. As these isoforms can have altered stability， localisation and coding potential， deregulation of APA can disrupt gene expression and this has been linked to many diseases including cancer progression. How APA generates cancer-specific isoform profiles and what their physiological consequences are， however， is largely unclear. Here we use a subcellular fractionation approach to determine the nuclear and cytoplasmic APA profiles of successive stages of colon cancer using a cell line-based model. Using this approach， we show that during cancer progression specific APA profiles are established. We identify that overexpression of hnRNPC has a critical role in the establishment of APA profiles characteristic for metastatic colon cancer cells， by regulating poly(A) site selection in a subset of genes that have been implicated in cancer progression including MTHFD1L.,RNA was extracted from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions from two biological replicates of the following cell lines: the non-malignant adult-derived human male colonic epithelial 1CT cell line and the SW480 and SW620 cell lines， which both derive from the same patient. The SW480 cell line was established from a Dukesâ type B primary adenocarcinoma of the colon and the SW620 cell line was derived from a lymph node after cancer recurred with widespread metastasis. The 3â ends of extracted RNA were generated into libraries using the QuantSeq 3âmRNA-Seq library kit (Lexogen). Libraries were processed on the Ion Chef platform and subsequently sequenced on the Ion Proton system. Sequences were aligned using the Ion Torrent Server TMAP aligner to genome build hg19.

MARS-seq2.0 an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with Single-cell RNA sequencing,GSE123392,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Human tissues are composed of trillions of cells that populate a complex space of molecular phenotypes and functions that vary in abundance by 4-9 orders of magnitude. Relying solely on unbiased sampling to characterize cellular niches becomes non-feasible， as the marginal utility of collecting more cells is diminishing quickly. Further， in many clinical samples， the relevant cell types are scarce and efficient processing is critical. We developed an integrated pipeline for index-sorting and massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq (MARS-seq2.0) that is based on over 1 million cells sequenced with this pipeline. These include， identification of unique cell types across different tissues， diseases， and unique model systems and organisms. In addition we developed several modalities that are based on MARS-seq2.0， including genetic perturbations (CRISP-seq) and spatial reconstruction (NICHE-seq). Here we present a detailed step-by-step procedure to apply the method. We combine sub microliter reaction volumes， optimization of enzymatic mixtures and enhanced analytical pipeline (http://compgenomics.weizmann.ac.il/tanay/?page_id=672) to significantly lower cost， improve reproducibility and reduce the well-to-well contamination. Data analysis combines multiple layers of quality assessment and error detection and correction， graphically presenting key statistics of library complexity， noise distribution and sequencing saturation. Importantly， our combined FACS and single cell RNA-seq workflow enables for intuitive approaches to deplete or enrich for cell populations in a data driven manner that is essential for efficient sampling of complex tissues. The experimental protocol， from sorted plates to a ready to sequence library， takes 2 days. Sequencing and running the analytical pipeline takes another 1-2 days.,Transcriptional profiling of single cells from cell lines and mouse models of， generated from deep sequencing of thousands of cells， sequenced in several batches on illumina Nextseq500.

m5C profiles in zebrafish embryo sample.,GSE120645,Danio rerio;Homo sapiens,Total RNA was isolated from zebrafish embryos harvested at different stages using TRIzolÂ® Reagent (Ambion). mRNA was extracted with using DynabeadsÂ® mRNA Purification Kit (Ambion) and subjected to TURBOâ¢ DNase (Invitrogen) treatment at 37Â°C for 30 min and ethanol precipitation. Thus purified mRNA was used for RNA-BisSeq library construction. Around 200 ng mRNA premixed with the in vitro transcribed Dhfr mRNA at a ratio of 300:1 (Dhfr mRNA serves as methylation conversion control) was fragmented to ~100-nt fragments for 1 min at 90Â°C in 10Ã RNA Fragmentation Reagent (Ambion)， then stopped by 10Ã RNA stop solution (Ambion)， and precipitated with 100% ethanol.

Genome-wide mapping of UPF1 and Pol II [ChIP-seq],GSE116806,Drosophila melanogaster,ChIP with NMD core componenet UPF1 antibody in normal S2 cells and ChIP with Pol II Ser2 antibodies in S2 cells.UPF1 is an ATP-driven RNA helicase required for efficient nonsense mediated mRNA decay in eukaryotes. Although it is currently understood that UPF1 primarily acts on the 3âUTR of translating mRNAs in the cytoplasm， our data indicates that this is a highly dynamic protein that is rapidly shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm in Drosophila. Additionally， ChIP-seq analysis in different cell types demonstrates genome-wide association of UPF1 with nascent RNAs at most of the active Pol II transcription sites， and at some specific Pol III genes. Notably， intron recognition appears to interfere with association and translocation of UPF1 on nascent transcripts. Cells depleted of UPF1 show defects in nuclear processes such as mRNA export and transcription site retention. These data， thus redefine UPF1 as a global player in mRNA based processes in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.,To examine the presence of UPF1 RNA helicase on chromosomes， replicates of  UPF1 ChIP DNA were sequenced by using Illumina HiSeq4000. Input was sequenced as ChIP control. Role of UPF1 in transcription regulation was examined by Pol II Ser2 or Pol II ChIP in control and UPF1 depleted cells. All the experiments were done using Drosophila embryonic S2 cells.,30907728,Elife
Comprehensive analysis of small RNAs reveals insight into the tolerance of Ziyang xiangcheng (Citrus junos Sieb. ex Tanaka) to alkaline stress,GSE115049,Citrus trifoliata;Citrus junos,Alkaline stress has serious negative effects on citrus production. Ziyang xiangcheng (Citrus junos Sieb. ex Tanaka) (Cj) has been reported to be a rootstock that is tolerant to alkaline stress and iron deficiency. Poncirus trifoliata (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.) (Pt)， the most widely used rootstock in China， is sensitive to alkaline stress. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the tolerance of Cj to alkaline stress， next-generation sequencing was employed to profile the root transcriptomes and small RNAs of Cj and Pt seedlings which were cultured in nutrient solution with three gradient pH. This two-regulation level data set provides a system-level view of molecular events with precise resolution. The data suggest that the auxin pathway may play a central role in inhibitory effect of alkaline stress on root growth， and the regulation of auxin homeostasis under alkaline stress was important for citrus adapting to alkaline stress. Moreover， the JA pathway shown an opposite response to alkaline stress in Cj and Pt may contributes to the differentials of root system architecture and iron deficiency tolerance between Cj and Pt. The data set provides a wealth of genomic resources and new clues for further studying the mechanisms underlying Cj that resist alkaline stress.,The seeds of Cj and Pt were surface-sterilized and their germination accelerated. The seedlings were grown in a growth chamber until they had four leaves. Then， the seedlings were selected by uniform size and transferred into hydroponics with 4 L solution in a green house. Three different pH gradients (6.5， 8.0 and 9.5) were set up. Because most natural soils have a weak acidity， we set pH 6.5 as the normal condition. After 8 weeks of culture， three biological replicates (three seedling plants per replicate) were harvested randomly for each treatment. Cj1， Cj2 and Cj3 were represented the seedlings of Cj cultured in pH 6.5， 8.0 and 9.5 condition， respectively. And it was the same for naming the seedlings of Pt. The root tissues of Cj and Pt were used for miRNA-seq. A total of six different samples， each with three replicates， were used for miRNA-seq. The mix samples Cj (mixed with Cj1， Cj2 and Cj3) and Pt (mixed with Pt1， Pt2 and Pt3) were used for degradome sequencing.,30854210,Hortic Res

Meg3 binding sites in mouse insulinoma cells,GSE99798,Mus musculus,We have shown that increased Î²-cell proliferation in functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (insulinomas) correlated with reduced expression of the long non-coding RNA Meg3 and increased expression of the oncogenic receptor c-Met. To investigate the target binding sites of Meg3 in and around the c-Met gene， we did ChIRP-Seq using biotinylated probes from the mouse Meg3 RNA sequence. This would help us better understand how Meg3 regulates ithe expression of c-Met to control Î²-cell proliferation in insulinoma cells.,Glutaraldehyde cross-linked chromatin was prepared from 10 million cells of a mouse pancreatic islet Î²-cell line (MIN6-4N) stably transfected with Vector or stably overexpressing Meg3.  Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) as performed using 2 pools of odd-numbered or even-numbered biotinylated probes from the mouse Meg3 RNA sequence using standard protocols (Sigma).

RNA-seq (H3K9ac and H3K4me3) analysis on Arabidopsis Col-0， hac1-1 (SALK_080380)， and hac1-2 (SALK_136314),GSE134176,Arabidopsis thaliana,Nutrient remobilization during leaf senescence nourishes the growing plant. Understanding the regulation of this process is essential for reducing our dependence on nitrogen fertilizers and increasing agricultural sustainability. Our lab is interested in chromatin changes that accompany the transition to leaf senescence. Previously， darker green leaves were reported for Arabidopsis thaliana hac1 mutants， defective in a gene encoding a histone acetyltransferase in the CREB-binding protein family. Here， we show that two Arabidopsis hac1 alleles display delayed age-related developmental senescence， but have normal dark-induced senescence. Using a combination of ChIP-seq for H3K9ac and RNA-seq for gene expression， we identified 44 potential HAC1 targets during age-related developmental senescence. Genetic analysis demonstrated that one of these potential targets， ERF022， is a positive regulator of leaf senescence. ERF022 is regulated additively by HAC1 and MED25， suggesting MED25 may recruit HAC1 to the ERF022 promoter to increase its expression in older leaves.,Leaves 12-14 from 49 day old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were harvested from one biological replicate and used for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to identify potential HAC1 targets.,nan,
Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites using ATAC-seq,GSE118221,Mus musculus,Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells that comprise different subsets: classical DC type 1 and 2 (cDC1 and cDC2， respectively) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC). In this study cDC1 or pDC were obtained in a two-step in vitro culture system according to Felker et al.， J. Immunol. 185， 5326-5335， 2010. Briefly， mouse bone marrow cells were first amplified with a specific cytokine cocktail and then induced to differentiate into DC with Flt3 ligand. cDC1 are CD11c+ CD11b+ XCR1+ and pDC are CD11c+ CD11b- B220+ and thus cDC1 and pDC were obtained by FACS sorting and subjected to Omin-ATAC-seq analysis.  As an example of practical application of HINT-ATAC， we performed Omin-ATAC-seq experiments of cDC and pDC cell populations and used HINT-ATAC to detect footprints within ATAC-seq peaks of each of these two cells. Next， we estimated changes in binding activity for all factors with a motif in JASPAR. Cell-specific TF activity is measured by the depth of footprints and number of reads flanking regions. Two known cDC factors， BATF3 and HES1， are detected. In summary， we demonstrated that HINT-ATAC is capable of identifying relevant factors for dendritic cell specification.,We performed ATAC-seq experiments in mouse classical dendritic cells type1 (cDC1) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in duplicates. Omni-ATAC-seq was performed according to Corces et al.， Nature Methods 14， 959-962， 2017 with minor modifications. Prior to transposition dead cells were removed by centrifugation (800 rpm， 4 min， 4Â°C). The transposition reaction was with 7.5 Î¼l Tagment DNA Enzyme 1 (TDE1) for 60 min at 37Â°C.Pre-amplification was with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix and Nextera PCR Primers (5 cycles). Quantitative PCR amplification was with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix， Nextera PCR Primer， and SYBR Gold to determine the number of additional cycles. PCR amplification of additional cycles was as for pre-amplification. PCR fragments were purified with Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit and library concentration and quality were determined by Agilent High Sensitive DNA Kit and Bioanalyzer， respectively.,30808370,Genome Biol
DAN (NBL1) promotes collective neural crest migration by restraining uncontrolled invasion,GSE101746,Gallus gallus,Neural crest cells are both highly migratory and significant to vertebrate organogenesis. However， the signals that regulate neural crest cell migration remain unclear. Here， we test the function of DAN， a BMP antagonist we detected by analysis of chick cranial mesoderm. Our analysis shows that， prior to neural crest cell exit from the hindbrain， DAN is expressed in the mesoderm， then it becomes absent along cell migratory pathways. Cranial neural crest and metastatic melanoma cells avoid DAN protein stripes in vitro. Addition of DAN reduces the speed of migrating cells， in vivo and in vitro respectively. In vivo loss-of-function of DAN results in enhanced neural crest cell migration by increasing speed and directionality. Computer model simulations support the hypothesis that DAN restrains cell migration by regulating cell speed. Taken together， our results identify DAN as a novel factor that inhibits uncontrolled neural crest and metastatic melanoma invasion and promotes collective migration in a manner consistent with inhibition of BMP signaling.,Neural tube cultures were prepared and plated. DAN was added to the media at 0， 1 and 10 ug/ml. After overnight incubation， neural tubes and any ectoderm were removed from in vitro cultures using a tungsten needle and pipette. Media was then removed from neural tube cultures and the adherent neural crest cells were gently rinsed once with 0.1% DEPC PBS. Three biological replicates were harvested for each of the three conditions (untreated， 1 ug/ml and 10 ug/ml). cDNA was synthesized using SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (634888， Clontech) with subsequent library preparation by Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep (FC-131-1096， Illumina) and Index kits (FC-131-1002， Illumina). cDNA samples and libraries were both confirmed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 prior to RNAseq. Libraries were sequenced as 75bp， high output， paired reads on an Illumina NextSeq. Each sample generated in excess of 20 million fastq counts.,28811280,J Cell Biol
Single-Cell Analysis Uncovers Clonal Acinar Cell Heterogeneity in the Adult Pancreas,GSE80032,Mus musculus,Acinar cells make up the majority of all cells in the pancreas， yet the source of new acinar cells during homeostasis remains unknown. Using multicolor lineage-tracing and organoid-formation assays， we identified the presence of a progenitor-like acinar cell subpopulation. These cells have long-term self-renewal capacity， albeit in a unipotent fashion. We further demonstrate that binuclear acinar cells are terminally differentiated acinar cells. Transcriptome analysis of single acinar cells revealed the existence of a minor population of cells expressing progenitor markers. Interestingly， a gain of the identified markers accompanied by a transient gain of proliferation was observed following chemically induced pancreatitis. Altogether， our study identifies a functionally and molecularly distinct acinar subpopulation and thus transforms our understanding of the acinar cell compartment as a pool of equipotent secretory cells.,The single-cell RNA-seq library preparation protocol was based on the SMART seq2 protocol (Picelli et al.， 2014) with following modifications.Acinar cells were isolated as described in the section Acinar Cell Isolation and Culture and resuspended in DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PAN-Biotech). Cells were collected in a volume of 0.5 Î¼L and transferred to a reaction tube containing 4 Î¼L of 6 M guanidine-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich)， 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (âSigma-Aldrich). The tube was immediately transferred into liquid nitrogen and kept there for the duration of cell collection. Next， 2.2Ã RNA SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) were added directly to the lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with 70% ethanol. Air-dried beads were resuspended in a solution containing 2 Î¼L of H20， 1 Î¼L of oligo(dT) primer， and 1 Î¼L of dNTP Mix (primer and nucleotides used as in Picelli et al.， 2014). Twenty-four cells contained ERCC Spike-In RNAs (1:10，000; Mix2， Ambion) Mix in addition to primer and nucleotides. Beads were incubated for 3 min at 72Â°C， and reverse transcription and PCR (19 cycles) were performed as described by Picelli et al. (2014). PCR product was cleaned up using 0.8Ã DNA SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter)， and air-dried beads were resuspended in 15 Î¼L of H2O. The quality of cDNA library was assessed for each cell on a high-sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer chip. Subsequent steps (tagmentation， amplification， multiplexing) were done as previously described (Llorens-Bobadilla et al.， 2015). The DKFZ Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility conducted sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (paired-end 100 bp).,27923766,Dev Cell

High-throughput combinatorial indexing enables scalable single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling [species mixture],GSE123579,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,While recent technical advancements have facilitated the mapping of epigenomes at the single-cell resolution， the throughput and quality of these methods have limited the widespread application of these technologies. Here， we describe a high-throughput platform for single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) using droplet microfluidics that yields essential qualities for high-throughput profiling， including improvements in per-cell library complexity and throughput. This approach enables robust cell-typing of complex tissues and reveals a de novo atlas of cellular and epigenomic diversity across many cell types and cell stages.,A mixture of human K562 and murine 3T3 cells was profiled in various quantities to access cross-talk between cells in our combinatorial setting using 24-plex barcoded Tn5,31235917,Nat Biotechnol
Global transcriptomic changes following carbon limitation and elevated carbon dioxide in Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1: Illumina sequencing,GSE55861,Nannochloropsis oceanica,Limited systems-level understanding of CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) and metabolic adaption in response to different CO2-level in wild oleaginous algae has hindered the development of microalgal feedstock and the knowledge of its role in global warming and oceanic acidification. Nannochloropsis are a group of small unicellular microalgae widely distributed in oceans and fresh water， which implies that it plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles impinged on global climate change. In addition， Nannochloropsis has been used for flue gas fixation in many large-scale and pilot-scale outdoor cultivation facilities for photosynthetic production of fuels and chemicals. To untangle the intricate genome-wide networks underlying CCM and metabolic adjustment under different CO2 concentrations in Nannochloropsis， we applied high-throughput mRNA-sequencing and reconstructed the structure and dynamics of the genome-wide functional network underlying robust microalgal CCM and  in Nannochloropsis oceanica， by tracking the genome-wide， single-base-resolution transcript change for the complete time-courses of different CO2 concentrations.,Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 cells were grown in liquid cultures under continuous light (approximately 80Â±5 Âµmol photons m-2 s-1) at 25â and aerated by bubbling with a mixture of 5% CO2 in air. Mid-logarithmic phase algal cells were collected and washed three times with axenic seawater. Equal numbers of cells were re-inoculated in fresh medium and cultured under 5% CO2 for preadaption for one hour， and then two samples (from biological replicates) were collected as 0h samples. After the preadaption for one hour， half of them were sequentially grown under 5% in air (High carbon or HC) and other half of them were grown under 0.01% CO2   (Very low carbon or VLC) with 80Â±5 Âµmol m-2 s-1 light intensity， respectively. Cell aliquots were collected for RNA isolation after being transferred to the designated conditions for 3h， 6h， 12h and 24h. Three biological replicates of algal cultures were established under each of the above âVLCâ and âHCâ conditions， respectively. Two biological replicates were randomly selected to prepare mRNA-Seq library. In total， 18 samples collected at 5 time points (0h， 3h， 6h， 12h， and 24h) were used for mRNA-Seq library preparation and then submitted to Illumina HiSeq 2000 for sequencing.,31297156,Biotechnol Biofuels

Single-cell RNA-seq of UTCÎ±Î² population in sarcoma mice models,GSE123508,Mus musculus,Neutrophils represent a fundamental mechanism of antimicrobial resistance and inflammation 1. Moreover， neutrophils have emerged as important players in the activation， orchestration and regulation of adaptive immune responses2，3. Neutrophils are a component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and have been prevalently shown to promote progression 4-6. On the other hand， unleashed neutrophilic effectors have also been reported to mediate anti-cancer resistance7-11. Antibody-mediated depletion used to investigate the role of neutrophils in tumor progression suffers from limitations， including duration， specificity and perturbation of the system12. We therefore used a genetic approach to investigate the role of neutrophils in primary 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA)-induced sarcomagenesis. Neutrophils were found to play an essential role in resistance against primary carcinogenesis by driving an interferon-Î³ dependent type 1 immune response. Neutrophil-dependent macrophage production of IL-12p70 led to type 1 polarization of CD4- CD8- unconventional Î±Î² T cells (UTCÎ±Î²) in the TME. Single cell RNAseq analysis and in vivo evidence from two preclinical sarcoma models highlight the antitumor potential of a UTCÎ±Î² subset. In the TCGA cohort of human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS)， unlike other sarcomas， granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R) expression and a neutrophil signature were associated with better outcome and with a type 1 immune response. The positive association between high neutrophil infiltration and improved clinical outcome was confirmed in an independent UPS cohort by immunohistochemistry. Thus， neutrophils， by driving a type 1 immune response and polarization of UTCÎ±Î²， mediate resistance against murine and human sarcomas.,two experimental conditions， two biological replicates for each condition,31257026,Cell
Single-cell analysis reveals fibroblast heterogeneity and myofibroblasts in systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease,GSE128169,Homo sapiens,Myofibroblasts are key effector cells in the extracellular matrix remodeling of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)， however the diversity of fibroblast populations present in the healthy and SSc-ILD lung is unknown， and has prevented the specific study of the myofibroblast transcriptome.   We sought to identify and define the transcriptomes of myofibroblasts and other mesenchymal cell populations in human healthy and SSc-ILD lungs to understand how alterations in fibroblast phenotypes lead to SSc-ILD fibrosis.,We performed droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing with integrated canonical correlation analysis of 13 explanted lung tissue specimens (56，196 cells) from 4 healthy control and 4 SSc-ILD patients， with findings confirmed by cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) in additional samples.Please note that the control samples (GSM3660644-GSM3660648 in GSE128033) were re-used in the current study (as indicated in the GSM3666096-GSM3666100 sample titles).***The GEO records contain only processed data (raw counts in sparse matrix format) as raw data is unavailable due to patient privacy concerns.,31405848,Ann Rheum Dis

Combined RNA-seq and Polr2a ChIP-seq Identifies Gene Targets for Transcriptional Regulation in Vasopressin-Sensitive Collecting Duct Cells,GSE79573,Mus musculus,In mammals， the peptide hormone vasopressin controls renal water excretion， largely through its actions in the renal collecting duct to regulate the molecular water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2). There are two modes of regulation:  1) short-term regulation by membrane trafficking; and 2) long-term regulation involving vasopressin-induced changes in the abundance of the aquaporin-2 protein. Defects in the long-term regulation have been implicated in multiple water balance disorders. With the objetive to identify genes that are transcriptionally regulated in response to vasopressin in cultured mouse collecting duct cells (mpkCCD)， we carried out both RNA-seq to measure all transcripts (n=9) and ChIP-seq for RNA polymerase II (Polr2a) binding along the genome (n=3). Observations were made both after 24-hr treatment with the vasopressin analog dDAVP and with vehicle.Protocol:Confluent monolayers mpkCCD cells were washed in ice-cold 1X PBS (Ca+2/Mg+2-free) followed by cross-linking in 1.11% formaldehyde in Covaris Fixing Buffer (5.5 ml) for 5min at room temperature with gentle rocking (PN 520075， Covaris， Woburn， Massachusetts). Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of 1X Covaris Quenching Buffer with rocking. The buffer solution was aspirated and 1X ice-cold PBS was added to each plate. Cells were scraped into 15ml conical tubes， spun down (200 x g， 5 min)， and washed twice with PBS. After the second wash， cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 1X Covaris Lysis Buffer for 10 min at 4o C with rocking.  Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 1，700 x g for 5 min at 4o C. Nuclear pellets was resuspended in the 1X Covaris Wash Buffer and incubated for 10 mins at 4o C with rocking. Samples were spun at 1，700 x g for 5 min at 4o C. Nuclear pellets were washed twice with the Covaris Non-ionic Shearing Buffer and spun at 1，700 x g for 5 min at 4o C. Nuclei were resuspended in Covaris Non-ionic Shearing Buffer (Maximum of 1-3x 10^7cells per ml of buffer).  Shearing.  Two 20 ul aliquots of the resuspended pellets were removed prior to shearing to be used as subsequent unsheared controls for immunoblotting and agarose gel electrophoresis. The remaining samples were transferred to AFA tubes (TC12 x 12 mm) and volumes adjusted to 1 ml (V)). Samples were sheared using a Covaris S2 SonoLAB Single system for two minutes (Duty cycle: 5%; Intensity: 4; cycle: 200). Total nuclear protein concentration of each sample in mcg/ml (R) was determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific， Rockford， IL).  To test shearing efficiency， a 20 ul aliquot from each tube was removed after shearing to test the efficacy of shearing. The aliquots， including the unsheared sample， were incubated with 100 ul 1X TE buffer， 10 ul 10% SDS， and RNAse A (10 ug/ul， Cell Signaling Technology， Danvers， Massachusetts) for 30 mins at 37o C. 1 ul  proteinase K (20 ug/ul) was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 65o C. The DNA was purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator columns (Catalog #: D4013， Zymo Research， Irvine， CA) and ran on an E-gel EX 2% agarose (Invitrogen， Carlsbad， CA). Target fragment sizes for chromatin immunoprecipitation were in the range of 150-700 bp in length with average fragment size of 300 bp.  Testing epitope integrity (immunoblotting).  Total protein content was determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific， Rockford， IL).  Samples were then diluted with sample buffer (5X Laemmli buffer) at 20% (v/v) of the entire sample volume. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4-20% polyacrylamide gels， Criterion， Bio-Rad， Hercules， CA) and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (Hwang， 2010). Membranes were probed with anti-RNA polymerase II (Catalog #: MMS-126R， Covance). The antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution (anti-RNA polymerase II) (in Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4Â°C. After 1-h incubation with secondary antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences 680 anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G or 800 anti-mouse immunoglobulin G; Lincoln， NE) at 1:5000 dilution， sites of antibody-antigen reaction were detected using an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor).  Chromatin immunoprecipitation.  10 ul of sample equivalent to 2% input was removed prior to IP.  Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was performed using 30-90 ug of sheared chromatin in 500 uL of 1X Covaris Non-ionic Shearing Buffer with 10 Î¼l anti-RNA polymerase II antibodies. Samples were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with rotation， followed by addition of ChIP Grade Protein G Magnet Beads (Catalog #: 9006， Cell Signaling Technology) and incubation for 2 h at 4o C with rotation. The beads were washed a total of four times， including three low salt washes followed by one high salt wash for 5 mins/wash at 4o C (SimpleChIP protocol #9003， Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted from the beads with 150 ul of 1X ChIP Elution Buffer for 30 mins at 65o C in a thermomixer. To reverse crosslinks， 6 ul of 5M NaCl and 2 ul of 20 ug/ul  Proteinase K were added to the chromatin followed by incubation at 65o C overnight. DNA was purified according to SimpleChIP protocol #9003， Cell Signaling Technology.   q-PCR.    To check the success of the chromatin immunoprecipitation， input and ChIPâed DNA samples were amplified with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. Primer sets corresponding to Hox9a and actin genes were used as positive controls for both histone and RNA polymerase II IPâs. (see Supplementary Table X for primer sequences).  Library construction， amplification and sequencing.   Loaded fixed volume of total eluate. Library construction was performed on a NuGEN instrument using the protocol and reagents outlined in the Ovation SP Ultralow Library Systems kit. Libraries were then enriched via PCR. After amplification， DNA was measured.  A fixed amount of the total measured DNA was used for sequencing in an Illumina Hiseq2000 instrument to obtain single read data.  High-throughput sequencing and read mapping. Libraries for Illumina sequencing of the samples were prepared using the the protocol and reagents outlined in the Ovation SP Ultralow Library Systems kit ， NuGen Mondrian SP+ (NuGEN， San Carlos， CA) . Samples were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000， obtaining 1- by 50-bp reads.,We combine RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to identify genes whose mRNA abundances change in tandem with changes in RNA polymerase II binding， as a mean to identify genes that are transcriptionally regulated in response to vasopressin.   In addition， the pattern of RNA polymerase II binding along the gene provides important information about regulatory mechanisms.   We identify two populations of genes regulated by vasopressin in mpkCCD cells， viz. 1) those with increases in transcript abundance and increases in RNA polymerase II binding throughout the gene body and; 2) genes that show increases in RNA polymerase II binding in the promotor proximal region but do not produce increases in transcript level.  The former group is restricted to 35 genes and includes Aqp2. The latter group is made up of the majority of expressed genes and is presumably due to a widespread increase in transcriptional initiation without proportionate release of pausing.,nan,
Tet inactivation disrupts YY1 binding and long-range chromatin interactions to cause developmental defects in embryonic heart,GSE121671,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Tet-mediated DNA methylation oxidation plays an important role in shaping the epigenetic landscapes and chromatin accessibility during gene expression. While several studies demonstrated pivotal roles of Tet proteins in regulating embryonic development， little is known about their functions in heart development. Here we systemetically analyzed DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation dynamics during early cardiac development in both human and mice. We discovered that cardiac-specific deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 in mice (Tet2/3-DKO) led to ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) with embryonic lethality. Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses revealed dramatic decrease of cardiomyocytes in Tet2/3-DKO heart tissues. Impaired DNA demethylation and chromatin accessibility in Tet2/3-DKO mice further compromised chromatin association of a key transcription factor， Ying-yang1 (YY1)， and reduced long-range promoter-enhancer interactions at key genes involved in cardiac development. Taken together， our studies establish the physiological role of Tet proteins in the regulation of DNA methylation dynamics and chromatin configuration during embryonic heart development in mammals.,In this study， we systematically investigated the DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation dynamics during early cardiac development in both human and mice. Furthermore， we generated a cardiac specific Tet2 and Tet3 double deficient mouse model to investigate the function of Tet-mediated DNA modifications during early cardiac development. These mice developed severe developmental defects in the ventricular wall reminiscent of non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC). With this disease-relevant in vivo model， we further unveiled previously-unrecognized roles of Tet-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation in regulating chromatin accessibility to facilitate the genomic recruitment of one key transcription factor， Ying-Yang 1 (YY1). More excitingly， our study uncovered a crucial role of Tet/5hmC in modulating chromatin long-range interactions to coordinate higher-order chromatin organization during embryonic heart development.,31541101,Nat Commun
Pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell transcriptome read-out,GSE92872,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We combined CRISPR genome editing with single-cell RNA sequencing to assess complex phenotypes in pooled cellular screens. Our method for CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) comprises four key components: a gRNA vector that makes individual gRNAs detectable in single-cell transcriptomes， a high-throughput assay for single-cell RNA-seq， a computational pipeline for assigning single-cell transcriptomes to gRNAs， and a bioinformatic method for analyzing and interpreting gRNA-induced transcriptional profiles. CROP-seq allowed us to link gRNA expression to the associated transcriptome responses in thousands of single cells using a straightforward and broadly applicable screening workflow. Additional information are available from the CROP-seq websitehttp://crop-seq.computational-epigenetics.org,Drop-seq species mixing experiment was performed with human HEK293T and mouse 3T3 cells in a 1:1 proportion as described by Macosko et al.For CROP-seq， Jurkat cells were transduced with a gRNA library targeting high-level regulators of T cell receptor signaling and a set of transcription factors. After 10 days of antibiotic selection and expansion， cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies or left untreated. Both conditions were analyzed using CROP-seq， measuring TCR activation for each gene knockout. Our dataset comprises 5，905 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with uniquely assigned gRNAs.All CROP-seq raw data files are multiplexed with single-cell reads. Each read 1 contains the cell barcode (12 bp) and a molecule barcode (8 bp) and read 2 contains the transcriptome read. The libraries are pooled by nature but also intrinsically labelled. The file CROP-seq_Jurkat_TCR.digital_expression.csv.gz contains gene level expression quantifications of each gene for each cell which corresponds to the cell barcode in read1.For the Drop-seq_HEK293T-3T3 sample (Drop-seq species mixing)， reads aligning to two genomes were used to quantify for each cell barcode the amount of reads coming from each genome. In a similar way， in the CROP-seq_HEK293T sample (CROP-seq gRNA mixing)， the number of gRNA molecules detected per cell barcode (which is possible due to the polyadenylation of these gRNA-containing transcripts when expressed from a Pol2 promoter as engineered) were counted.,28099430,Nat Methods

AIBP-mediated Cholesterol Efflux Instructs  Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Fate,GSE122204,Mus musculus,Hypercholesterolemia， the driving force of atherosclerosis， accelerates the expansion and mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The molecular determinants connecting hypercholesterolemia with hematopoiesis are underexplored. Here we report that a novel somite-derived pro-hematopoietic cue， AIBP， orchestrates HSPC emergence from the hemogenic endothelium， a type of specialized endothelium manifesting hematopoietic potential. Mechanistically， AIBP-mediated cholesterol efflux activates endothelial Srebp2， the master transcription factor for cholesterol biosynthesis， which transactivates Notch and promotes HSPC emergence. Srebp2 inhibition impairs hypercholesterolemia-induced HSPC expansion. Srebp2 activation and Notch upregulation are associated with HSPC expansion in hypercholesterolemic human subjects. Genome-wide ChIP-seq， RNA-seq， and ATAC-seq indicate that Srebp2 trans-regulates Notch pathway genes required for hematopoiesis. Our studies outline a novel AIBP-regulated Srebp2-dependent paradigm for HSPC emergence in development and HPSC expansion in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.,The ATAC-Seq was performed using 50，000 c-Kit+CD144+ CD45.2- cells isolated from AGM region of E11.5 wild-type B6 mouse embryos. The Tn5 transposome was purified and assembled following a published protocol (46).  The permeabilization was performed with 50 Âµl cold ATAC-RSB buffer (0.1% NP40， 0.1% Tween-20， and 0.01% Digitonin) and the transposition was performed with 50 Âµl transposition mix (10Âµl 5Ã HEPES DMF Buffer， 3 Âµl 5 ÂµM Tn5 transposome， 37 Âµl PBS， 0.5 Âµl 10% Tween-20， and 0.5 Âµl 1% digitonin) and incubated at 37Â° for 30 min. After transposition， the cleaned-up DNA fragments were pre-amplified for 5 cycles using NEB Q5 master mix. Each reaction contains 2.5 Âµl of 25 ÂµM i5 primer， 2.5 Âµl of 25 ÂµM i7 primer， 25 Âµl 2Ã NEB Q5 master mix， and 20 Âµl cleaned up samples.  PCR settings were 5 min at 72Â°C， 30 sec at 98Â°C， and followed by additional 5 cycles (98Â°C for 10 sec， 63Â°C for 30 sec， 72Â°C for 1 min). After pre-amplification， 1 Âµl of the pre-amplified mixture was used to run a 10 Âµl qPCR test to determine the optimal amplification cycle. The final amplified DNA library was purified using Qiagen DNA purification kit and sequenced on NextSeq 500 with SE75 strategy.This submission represents the ATA-Seq component of study.,30705153,Science

Amplicon of Single-Cell Genotyping of Transcriptomes,GSE117825,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Somatic cancer driver mutations may result in distinctly diverging phenotypic outputs. Thus， a common driver lesion may result in cancer subtypes with distinct clinical presentations and outcomes. The diverging phenotypic outputs of mutations result from the superimposition of the mutations with distinct progenitor cell populations that have differing lineage potential. However， our ability to test this hypothesis has been challenged by currently available tools. For example， flow cytometry is limited in its inability to resolve lineage commitment of early progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) may provide higher resolution mapping of the early progenitor populations as long as high throughput technology is available to sequence thousands of single cells. Nevertheless， high throughput scRNA-seq is limited in its inability to jointly and robustly detect the mutational status and the transcriptional profile from the same cell.  To overcome these limitations， we propose the use of scRNA-seq combined with targeted mutation sequencing from transcrptional read-outs.,We apply this method to study myeloid neopasms， in which the comlex process of hematopoiesis is corrupted by mutated stem and progenitor cells.,31270458,Nature
Transcript profiles of developing Arabidopsis dgat1-1 mutant seed,GSE123303,Arabidopsis thaliana,Global transcript profiling of Arabidopsis dgat1-1 seed at different stages of embryo development was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the mutant compared to wild-type (Col-0) seed. These genes provided information about the remodeling of lipid metabolism and TAG synthesis in response to the lack of DGAT1 activity.,In depth transcriptome profile was generated using RNA-Seq for total RNA extracted from different seed development stages 8， 12， 16 Days after flowering (DAF). Samples were collected from wild type (WT) and dgat1-1 genotypes， with three biological replicates for each time point/genotype combination. RNA was sequenced at the Genomics Core at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The mRNA fraction was enriched with oligo dT capture， sized， reverse transcribed into cDNA and ligated with the appropriate indexed adaptors using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Following Agilent Bioanalyzer QC of the library preparation and library quantification using the Roche Lightcycler96 with KAPA SYBR Fast Universal qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems)， the RNA-Seq libraries were adjusted to a 4nM concentration and pooled for multiplexed sequencing. Libraries were denatured and based on qPCR results， diluted to the appropriate concentration， followed by clonal clustering onto the sequencing flow cell using the TruSeq Paired-End (PE) Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). The clonal clustering procedure was automated using the Illumina cBOT Cluster Station. The clustered flow cell was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (Illumina) to obtain 100bp pair-end reads， which were trimmed and quality assessed before assembly against the Arabidopsis reference genome (Araport 11) using CLC genomics workbench (v 7.5.1),31221730,Plant Physiol
Transcriptome analysis of Oshsfa2e mutant plants under controlled drought stress and well-watered conditions at vegetative stage,GSE65025,Oryza sativa Japonica Group,Heat shock factors (Hsfs) are known to regulate heat and drought stress response by controlling the expression of heat shock proteins and oxidative stress responsive genes. Loss-of-function of OsHSFA2e gene resulted in increased sensitivity of rice plants to drought and heat stress. To identify the targets of OsHSFA2e and dissect the stress response pathway regulated by it， we performed transcriptome profiling of Oshsfa2e mutant plants under drought stress as well as well-watered conditions by RNA-sequencing.,OsHSFA2e loss-of-function rice plants (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) were exposed to controlled drought stress and well-watered conditions at the vegetative stage. Controlled drought (DR) stress was applied on 45 day old plants following gravimetric approach. The soil water content was brought down to 40% field capacity over a period of 3-4 days and plants were maintained at that level for 10 days by weighing the pots daily at a fixed time of the day and replenishing the water lost through evapotranspiration. Another set of plants were maintained at 100% FC as well-watered (WW) condition. Total RNA isolated from leaf tissue was used for RNA-sequencing. Two biological replicates per sample were sequenced. cDNA library was constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Plant kit (Illumina). Sequencing was carried out on each library to generate 50 bp SE reads using Illumina High-Seq 2000 platform. The transcriptome reads were mapped to the rice reference genome sequence (MSU 7.0) with tophat1.3.1 using the programâs default parameters (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu). Mapped RNA-Seq reads were assembled into transcripts by Cufflinks (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/) and differentially expressed genes were identified by using Cuffdiff.,nan,
CROP-seq analysis of TCR stimulation using the 10x Genomics platform,GSE137554,Homo sapiens,T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in Jurkat cells was investigated using the CROP-seq method for CRISPR single-cell sequencing. In CROP-seq， genetic perturbations are introduced into single cells in a pooled fashion， and single-cell RNA-seq is used to determine the transcriptional response to the CRISPR-induced perturbation in a large number of single cells in parallel. Importantly， the CROP-seq vector makes individual guide-RNAs detectable using standard single-cell RNA-seq technology.The dataset presented here is based on CROP-seq in combination with single-cell RNA-seq using the 10x Genomics v2 chemistry. It recapitulates a previously published CROP-seq dataset (Datlinger et al. 2017 Nature Methods; GEO: GSE92872) that used the Drop-seq protocol as the single-cell RNA-seq readout. Additional information on CROP-seq are available from the following website:http://crop-seq.computational-epigenetics.org/.,Cas9-expressing Jurkat cells were transduced using a lentiviral vector with a guide-RNA library targeting candidate regulators of TCR signaling， including signaling proteins and transcription factors. After 10 days of cell expansion with antibiotic selection for guide-RNA expressing cells， cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (which induces potent TCR stimulation) or left untreated (control samples). Stimulated und unstimulated cells were subjected to single-cell RNA-seq using the Single Cell 3â Library & Gel Bead Kit v2 (10x Genomics) followed by Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing. The sequencing data were analyzed using standard methods. To identify the guide-RNAs in each cell， a reference genome was created by extending the genome with the sequences of all used guide-RNAs.,nan,
Atlas of Subcellular RNA Localization Revealed by APEX-seq,GSE116008,Homo sapiens,We introduce APEX-seq， a method for RNA sequencing based on direct proximity labeling of RNA using the peroxidase enzyme APEX2. APEX-seq in nine distinct subcellular locales produced a nanometer-resolution spatial map of the human transcriptome as a resource， revealing extensive patterns of localization for diverse RNA classes and transcript isoforms. We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome， which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria， each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems， enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome.,APEX-seq libraries for both labeled targets and unlabeled controls were generated for the following constructs: (1) NLS (nucleus)， (2) NIK (nucleolus)， (3) LMA (nuclear lamina)， (4) NucPore (nuclear pore)， (5) NES (cytosol)， (6) ERM (ER membrane cytosol facing)， (7) KDEL (ER lumen)， (8) OMM (Outer mitochondrial membrane)， and (9) MITO (mitochondrial matrix). 4 libraries were prepared for each construct (2 biological replicates for labeled targets， 2 biological replicates for unlabeled controls). Furthermore， we generated drug-perturbation libraries for OMM and NES using the following treatments: (1) cycloheximide， (2) puromycin and (3) m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In addition， nocodazole-perturbation libraries for OMM and NES were generated following drug treatment for: (1) 3 minutes， (2) 6 minutes， (3) 9 minutes， (4) 30 minutes and (5) 2 hours. We also generated nuclear and cytosol fractionation RNA-seq libraries (2 replicates each) following a protocol by Gagnon et al. (Nature Protocols， 2014).,31230715,Cell

RNA-Seq data on KMO inhibitor (CHDI-00340246) subchronic treated R6/2 mice.,GSE105158,Mus musculus,Dysregulation of the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway has been associated with the progression of Huntington's disease (HD). In particular， elevated levels of the kynurenine metabolites 3-hydroxy kynurenine (3-OH-Kyn) and quinolinic acid (Quin)， have been reported in the brains of HD patients as well as in rodent models of HD. The production of these metabolites is controlled by the activity of kynurenine mono-oxygenase (KMO)， a mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of 3-OH-Kyn from Kyn.  Thus inhibiting KMO is expected to produce a beneficial effect in Huntington's Disease (HD) patients， hopefully reversing their phenotype to match healthy subjects. To test this effect， we chronically treated a mouse model of HD (R6/2， a transgenic mouse model of HD which contains a human HTT gene containing 90 CAG repeats) and wild type mice with a KMO inhibitor for 8 weeks， and separately used a mock treatment on both the transgenic mice and wild type mice. The goal of this project is to analyze the RNA-seq data and find gene expression changes associated with the KMO inhibitor.,12 wk old R6/2 and WT mice were treated per os twice-daily with 30 mg/kg CHDI-00340246 or vehicle (10% (w/v) HP-Î²-CD in 50mM Citrate Buffer (pH 5.5)) for 8 weeks (4-12 weeks of age). Cerebral cortex and striatum samples were taken from 23 mice， giving a total of 46 samples (half cortex and half striatum). RNA-seq data was collected on the three sets of mice. There were 8 HD+drug mice， 7 HD+mock mice， and 8 WT+mock mice. The mice were a mix of male and female.,nan,

Systematic functional characterization of BAF mutations yields novel intra-complex synthetic lethalities [ChIP-Seq],GSE108387,Homo sapiens,Aberrations in genes coding for subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex are highly abundant in human cancers. Currently， it is not understood how these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cancer development and how they can be targeted therapeutically.

Dynamic Change of Transcription Pausing through Modulating NELF Protein Stability Regulates Granulocytic Differentiation,GSE98555,Homo sapiens,The NELF complex is a metazoan-specific factor essential for establishing transcription pausing. Although NELF has been implicated in cell fate regulation， the cellular regulation of NELF and its intrinsic role in specific lineage differentiation remains largely unknown. Using mammalian hematopoietic differentiation as a model system， here we identified a dynamic change of NELF-mediated transcription pausing as a novel mechanism regulating hematopoietic differentiation. We found a sharp decrease of NELF protein abundance during granulocytic differentiation with a consequent genome-wide reduction of transcription pausing. This loss of pausing coincides with activation of granulocyte-affiliated genes and diminished expression of progenitor markers.  Functional studies revealed that sustained expression of NELF inhibits granulocytic differentiation， whereas NELF depletion in progenitor cells leads to premature differentiation towards the granulocytic lineage. Our results thus uncover a previously unrecognized regulation of transcription pausing by modulating NELF protein abundance to control cellular differentiation.,using Gro-seq to analyze transcription in NELF-knockdown human CD34+ HSPCs and early differentiated granulocytes,28868519,Blood Adv
FB5P-seq: FACS-based 5-prime end single-cell RNAseq for integrative analysis of transcriptome and antigen receptor repertoire in B and T cells,GSE137275,Homo sapiens,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) allows the identification， characterization， and quantification of cell types in a tissue. When focused on B and T cells of the adaptive immune system， scRNAseq carries the potential to track the clonal lineage of each analyzed cell through the unique rearranged sequence of its antigen receptor (BCR or TCR， respectively)， and link it to the functional state inferred from transcriptome analysis. Here we introduce FB5Pseq， a FACS-based 5â-end scRNAseq method for cost-effective integrative analysis of transcriptome and paired BCR or TCR repertoire in phenotypically defined B and T cell subsets. We describe in details the experimental workflow and provide a robust bioinformatics pipeline for computing gene count matrices and reconstructing repertoire sequences from FB5Pseq data. We further present two applications of FB5Pseq for the analysis of human tonsil B cell subsets and peripheral blood antigen-specific CD4 T cells. We believe our novel integrative scRNAseq method will be a valuable option to study rare adaptive immune cell subsets in immunology research.,This dataset contains data from B cell subsets sorted from two non-malignant human tonsil samples (Tonsil 1 and Tonsil 2)， and C.alb-specific T cells sorted from human peripheral blood after in vitro peptide restimulation.

Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) acquires transcriptional competence under 17b-estradiol in ERa-positive breast cancer cells [ChIP-seq],GSE137558,Homo sapiens,Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) is a well-known regulator of gene expression during acute environmental stress that enables the cells to survive. Its high level in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients correlated with a worse prognosis. Here， we demonstrated that 17Î²-estradiol (E2) as well as bisphenol A (BPA) and propyl pyrazole triol (PPT， ERÎ± agonist) led to HSF1 phosphorylation on S326 in ERÎ± positive mammary breast cancer cells， but not in ERÎ±-negative ones. We showed that ERK1/2 signaling was involved in this process and down-regulation of ERÎ± expression abrogated it. E2Â­activated HSF1 was transcriptionally potent. Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq analyses revealed that it could modulate the expression of several genes known to be essential for breast cancer cells growth and/or ERÎ± action， i.e. HSPB8， LHX4， PRKCE， WWC1， and GREB1. Our findings indicate that a positive feedback loop between ERÎ± and HSF1 signaling may exist which support the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors.,We sequenced DNA immunoprecipitated from wild type MCF7 cells using rabbit polyclonal anti-HSF1 antibodies. Cells were untreated (control)， subjected to hyperthermia or stimulated using estrogen (17beta-estradiol) for indicated time. Six ChIP replicates were collected and pooled per each sequenced sample. Input samples were included as negative control (no DNA enrichment was observed in mock-IP samples).,31614463,Cancers (Basel)
RNA sequencing identifies differentially expressed genes in embryonic cardiomyocytes following knockdown of DNMT1 expression for 72 h,GSE81446,Mus musculus,Purpose: This study aims to identify the differentially expressed genes in embryonic cardiomyocytes following the knockdown of DNMT1 expression. Methods: Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from mouse embryonic day (E) 13.5 ventricles， and cultured for 48 h at 37Â°C to reach 70-80% confluency. Cells were transfected with either Qiagen FlexiTube GeneSolution (with 4 siRNAs) DNMT1 siRNA (#GS13433) or AllStars negative control siRNA (#1027281) at 12 nM using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (n=3 per treatment). At 72 h after transfection， cells were released with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies， San Diego， CA) and dissociated with Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies). To sort cardiomyocytes， dissociated cells were stained with anti-VCAM1 antibody conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC; BioLegend， San Diego， CA) and magnetically sorted using anti-APC microbeads and magnetic assisted cell sorting (MACS) columns (Miltenyi Biotec， Bergisch Gladbach， Germany). Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cardiomyocytes with the RNAqueousÂ®-Micro Total RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific， Waltham， MA). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared with the NEBNextÂ® mRNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB， Ipswich， MA). The Illumina-adapted libraries were pooled at equal molar ratio and sequenced with one High Output 1x75 cycles run on a NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina). The fastq files generated from RNA-Seq were uploaded to the UF Research Computing Galaxy instance developed by the University of Florida. The data were cleaned with the following steps: removed sequencing artifacts， trimmed 5â or 3â ends with low scores， removed adaptor contamination， and filtered low quality reads by the FastQC program. The remaining high quality RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) with the Tophat2 tool. Counting of RNA-seq reads were performed with HTSeq. Differential expression (DE) of genes between treatments was analyzed using two methods: R packages EdgeR and DEseq2， with Ensembl Mus_GRCm38.79.gtf as the reference annotation. Genes with false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 and absolute fold change greater than 1.5 were considered as significant. Unique DE genes were identified by combining the results generated from the two analytical methods. Results: DE analysis by DEseq2 and EdgeR software revealed that 801 genes were up-regulated， and 494 genes were down-regulated after knockdown of DNMT1 expression for 72 h.,The mRNA profile in embryonic cardiomyocytes with knockdown of DNMT1 expression was generated by deep sequencing (n=3 for negative siRNA and n=3 for DNMT1 siRNA)， using Illumina NextSeq500.,34235895,FEBS Open Bio
Global identification of functional microRNA-mRNA interactions in Drosophila,GSE109980,Drosophila melanogaster,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional gene expression silencing. So far， no comprehensive experimental annotation of functional miRNA target sites exists in Drosophila. To close this gap， we generated the first transcriptome-wide in vivo map of miRNA-mRNA interactions in Drosophila melanogaster， making use of single nucleotide resolution in Argonaute1 (AGO1) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data.Absolute quantification of cellular miRNA levels presents the miRNA pool in Drosophila cell lines to be more diverse than previously reported. Benchmarking two CLIP approaches， we identify a similar predictive potential to unambiguously assign thousands of miRNA-mRNA pairs from AGO1 interaction data at unprecedented depth， achieving higher signal-to-noise ratios than with computational methods alone.

Widespread Long-range Cis-Regulatory Elements in the Maize Genome,GSE120304,Zea mays,Genetic mapping studies on crops suggest that agronomic traits can be controlled by loci within the gene-distal intergenic space. Despite the biological importance and the potential agronomic utility of these intergenic loci， they remain virtually uncharacterized in all crop species to date. Here， we provide genetic， epigenomic， and functional molecular evidence supporting the widespread existence of gene-distal (hereafter， distal) loci which act as long-range transcriptional cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the maize genome. Such loci are enriched for euchromatic chromatin features that suggest their regulatory functions. Chromatin loops link together putative CREs with genes and recapitulate eQTL-gene interactions. Additionally， putative CREs display elevated transcriptional enhancer activities， as measured by STARR-seq. These results provide functional support for the widespread existence of CREs which act over large genomic distances to modulate gene expression.,One MethylC-seq， six RNA-seq， 30 ChIP-seq， 37 DAP-seq， six ATAC-seq， one Hi-C， two HiChIP， and three STARR-seq samples of maize,31740773,Nat Plants

RNA-Seq Analysis of Genes Differentially Expressed across temporal and spatial deposition of wall ingrowths in Arabidopsis Phloem Parenchyma Transfer Cells,GSE107778,Arabidopsis thaliana,Transfer cells (TCs) play important roles in facilitating enhanced rates of nutrient transport at key apoplasmic/symplasmic junctions along the nutrient acquisition and transport pathways in plants. TCs achieve this capacity by developing elaborate wall ingrowth networks which serve to increase plasma membrane surface area thus increasing the cellâs surface area-to-volume ratio to achieve increased flux of nutrients across the plasma membrane. Phloem parenchyma (PP) cells of Arabidopsis leaf veins trans-differentiate to become PP TCs which likely function in a two-step phloem loading mechanism by facilitating unloading of photoassimilates into the apoplasm for subsequent energy-dependent uptake into the sieve element/companion cell (SE/CC) complex. We are using PP TCs in Arabidopsis as a genetic model to identify transcription factors involved in coordinating deposition of the wall ingrowth network. Confocal imaging of pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide-stained tissue revealed different profiles of temporal development of wall ingrowth deposition across maturing cotyledons and juvenile leaves， and a basipetal gradient of deposition across mature adult leaves. RNA-Seq analysis was undertaken to identify differentially expressed genes common to these three different profiles of wall ingrowth deposition. This analysis identified 68 transcription factors up-regulated two-fold or more in at least two of the three experimental comparisons， with six of these transcription factors belonging to Clade III of the NAC-domain family. Phenotypic analysis of these NAC genes using insertional mutants revealed significant reductions in levels of wall ingrowth deposition， particularly in a double mutant of NAC056 and NAC018， as well as compromised sucrose-dependent root growth， indicating impaired capacity for phloem loading. Collectively， these results support the proposition that Clade III members of the NAC domain family in Arabidopsis play important roles in regulating wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs.,The sampling enabled three different temporal and spatial pair-wise comparisons for RNA-Seq analysis， namely: (i) cotyledons at Day 5 vs Day 10; (ii) Leaf 1 and Leaf 2 (first juvenile leaves) at Day 10 vs Day 16; and (iii) basal vs apical third (base vs tip) of Leaf 12 at Day 31. This analysis provided temporal and spatial comparisons of tissues with absent vs abundant wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma transfer cells.,29599795,Front Plant Sci
Low-input and multiplexed microfluidic assay reveals epigenomic variation across cerebellum and prefrontal cortex,GSE99757,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,There has been an extensive effort underway to profile epigenetic features at the genome-wide scale using primary ex vivo tissues. Cell-type specificity of epigenomes calls for enrichment to obtain a homogenous cell population from a small quantity of tissues. Thus technologies that permit both ultralow input and high throughput are desired for profiling an array of histone marks. Here we demonstrate a simple microfluidic technology， SurfaceChIP-seq， for profiling genome-wide histone modifications using as few as 30 cells per assay and with up to 8 assays running in parallel. We applied the technology to study epigenomic landscapes in neurons and glia in prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of mouse brain. The data revealed extensive epigenomic difference in the two regions on important functional elements such as promoters and enhancers.,"We examined genome-wide H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 profiles in GM12878 cell line (using 30 to 10k cells per assay) using SurfaceChIP-seq. They include data generated by 4-channel (4C) and 8-channel (8C) devices and also devices produced using (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane /Glutaraldehyde/Protein A (AGP) linker.  We also profiled H3K4me3， H3K27ac and H3K27me3 marks in neurons (NeuN+) and glia (NeuN-) from mouse cerebellum and prefronal cortex (using 100 or 1k nuclei per assay) using SufaceChIP-seq. We generated RNA-seq data on neurons and glia from mouse prefronal cortex and cerebellum. Finally， we also included SurfaceChIP-seq and RNA-seq data obtained using the homogenate of mouse prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (referred to as ""mix"" in their file names). Three mice (M1， M2 and M3) were used in the study.",29675472,Sci Adv
Global transcriptional responses to KI-MS2-008 treatment and Myc inactivation via doxycycline addition,GSE107222,Homo sapiens,The Myc/Max heterodimer has crucial roles in normal cellular processes such as cell proliferation， metabolism， apoptosis， and differentiation， but its activity is often deregulated in a majority of human cancers. In an effort to explore alternative modes of Myc perturbation， we identified KI-MS2-008 as a small molecule that binds Max and modulates Myc-driven transcription， and in some cellular contexts， KI-MS2-008 treatment leads to a decrease in c-Myc protein levels. As the Myc/Max heterodimer controls many cellular processes， we expected that treatment with this small molecule would cause changes in the transcriptome. We found that treatment with 10 ÂµM KI-MS2-008 resulted in global alterations in the transcriptome， mimicking direct Myc inactivation with doxycycline in P493-6， a B cell line with a Tet-Off system for c-Myc expression. We also discovered enrichment of various Myc target gene sets in the genes downregulated in response to KI-MS2-008 treatment in P493-6 cells. This trend was also observed in ST486 cells， but not in P3HR1 cells， which were chosen as non-engineered B cell lines that were sensitive and insensitive， respectively， toward KI-MS2-008 in cell viability assays.,RNA-seq characterizing three B cell lines: P493-6 (an engineered， KI-MS2-008 sensitive cell line)， ST486 (a non-engineered， KI-MS2-008 sensitive cell line)， and P3HR1 (a non-engineered， KI-MS2-008 insensitive cell line). P493-6 cells were treated with 0.1 Âµg/mL doxycycline， 1 ÂµM KI-MS2-008， 10 ÂµM KI-MS2-008， or 0.4% DMSO for 45 minutes or 8 hours. ST486 cells were treated with 1 ÂµM KI-MS2-008， 10 ÂµM KI-MS2-008 or 0.4% DMSO for 45 minutes or 8 hours.

A cellular taxonomy of the bone marrow stroma in homeostasis and leukemia demonstrates cancer-crosstalk with stroma to impair normal tissue function,GSE128423,Mus musculus,Here， we use single-cell RNA-seq to define a cellular taxonomy of the mouse bone marrow stroma and its perturbation by malignancy.

Candidate genes mediated by estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRÎ³) in pancreatic Î² cells,GSE122805,Mus musculus,Recent studies have established the importance of ERRÎ³ as a required participant for insulin secretion in pancreatic Î² cells. Key downstream genes of ERRÎ³ remain unclear in the pancreatic Î² cell. To understand the molecular role of ERRÎ³ and elucidate potential key candidate genes involved in pancreatic Î² cells， the eukaryotic expression plasmid containing mouse ERRÎ³ was constructed and transfected into NIT-1 pancreatic Î² cells. Overexpression of ERRÎ³ was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR and western blot. RNA-seq was conducted to get the gene expression profiling between the experimental cells and control cells. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and subsequently analyzed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. We found that overexpression of ERRÎ³ in pancreatic Î² cells enables regulation of the expression of certain genes involved in cell apoptosis and mitochondrial function， such as TFPT， Bcl7c， Dap， Thoc6， Ube2d3， ATP5H， MPV17， and NDUFA6. GO analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in biological regulation， cell， and binding. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were significantly enriched in infectious diseases， translation annd signal transduction. This study helps to further understand and reposition the molecular mechanisms of ERRÎ³ in pancreatic Î² cells.,Examination the molecular role of ERRÎ³ and elucidate potential key candidate genes involved in pancreatic Î² cells，,nan,
Uncovering the role admixture in health disparities: Association of hepatocyte gene expression and DNA methylation to African Ancestry in African-Americans [RNA-seq],GSE124074,Homo sapiens,In African Americans (AA)， the proportion of West African ancestry (WAA) may explain the genetic drivers of health disparities in disease.  Analysis of RNA sequencing data from sixty AA-derived primary hepatocytes identified 32 gene expression profiles associated with WAA (FDR <0.05) with enrichment in angiogenesis and inflammatory pathways (FDR <0.1).  Association of DNA methylation to WAA identified 1037 differentially methylated regions (FDR <0.05)， with hypomethylated genes enriched for drug response pathways.  Within the PharmGKB pharmacogene， VDR， PTGIS， ALDH1A1， CYP2C19 and P2RY1 were associated with WAA (p <0.05) with replication of CYP2C19 and VDR in the GTEx liver cohort.  For every 1% increment in WAA， P2RY1 gene expression increased by 1.6% and CYP2C19 gene expression decreased by 1.4%， suggesting effects on clopidogrel response and platelet aggregation.  We conclude that WAA contributes to variablity in hepatic gene expression and DNA methylation with identified genes indicative of health disparities prevalent in AAs.,68 RNA samples from cultured liver hapatocytes were used for RNA-Seq,31798965,NPJ Genom Med
PML2âmediated threadâlike nuclear bodies mark late senescence in HutchinsonâGilford progeria syndrome [RNA-seq],GSE137083,Homo sapiens,Regular nuclear structure is critical for genome maintenance and proper gene expression， disorder of which has a causal role in aging. Accumulation of Progerin in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) disrupts the integrity of nuclear lamina and causes nuclear structure abnormalities， leading to premature aging. However， the nuclear structure/function relationships in HGPS cells have not been well addressed， and roles of nuclear sub-compartments for HGPS pathogenesis are rarely reported. Here， evidence reveals that classical dot-like PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) are reorganized into thread-like morphology in HGPS cells， and these irregular NBs are strongly associated with cell senescence. We demonstrate that farnesylated Progerin interacts with PML isoform 2 specifically， which accounts for the formation of thread-like PML NBs. Moreover， our findings uncover that irregular PML NBs perturb NBs-associated DNA repair and gene transcription， thereby promoting HGPS cell senescence. Thus， our work helps to clarify the roles of nuclear structure and sub-compartments such as PML NBs in cell aging， and evidence presented in this study strongly support that thread-like PML NBs could be a novel biomarker of human cell senescence.,Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were transfected with control siRNA (NFcon) or pan-PML siRNA (NFsi) to analyze the expression of PML NBs-associated genes in NHDF cells. Fibroblasts from the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) patient were treated with control siRNA (HGcon)， pan-PML siRNA (HGsi)， PML2 siRNA (HGI2si)， or FTI (2 uM of farnesylation inhibitor lonafarnib combined with 1 uM of zoledronate， HGFTI) for 3 days. High-throughput RNA sequencing were performed to analyze the differential gene expression between HGPS and NHDF， and to examine the 'rescue effect' of pan-PML siRNA， PML2 siRNA or FTI treatment on expression of PML NBs-associated genes in HGPS cells. Thus， there are total 6 groups of samples for RNA-seq， ie.， NFcon， NFsi， HGcon， HGsi， HGI2si and HGFTI. Each group contains 3 replications， and siRNA sequence information was described in the supporting data of the manuscript.,32351002,Aging Cell
Artemisinins target GABA receptor signaling to induce alpha to beta cell transdifferentiation,GSE84714,Homo sapiens,Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells， and generating new insulin-producing cells from other cell types is a major aim of regenerative medicine. One promising approach is transdifferentiation of developmentally related pancreatic cell types including glucagon-producing alpha cells. In a genetic model， overexpression of the master regulatory transcription factor Pax4 or loss of its counterplayer Arx are sufficient to induce the conversion of alpha cells to functional beta-like cells. Here we identify artemisinins as small molecules that functionally repress Arx and induce beta-cell characteristics in alpha cells. We show that the protein gephyrin is the mammalian target of these antimalaria drugs. Finally， we demonstrate that gephyrin-mediated enhancement of GABAA receptor signaling is the mechanism of action of these molecules in pancreatic transdifferentiation. Our results indicate that gephyrin is a novel druggable target for the regeneration of pancreatic beta cell mass from alpha cells.,Transcriptional dissection of Artemether treated， human pancreatic islets of one donor using single-cell RNA-seq,27916275,Cell

Rapid recapitulation of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis upon loss of HCF-1 function in mouse hepatocytes [RNA-seq],GSE115766,Mus musculus,Background and Aims: Host-cell factor 1 (HCF-1)， encoded by the ubiquitously expressed X linked gene Hcfc1， is an epigenetic co-regulator important for mouse development and cell proliferation， including during liver regeneration. Here， we examine the role of HCF-1 in adult tissue physiology using， as model， the resting mouse liver. Methods: We used a hepatocyte-specific inducible Hcfc1 knock-out allele (called Hcfc1hepKO)， to induce HCF-1 loss in hepatocytes of hemizygous Hcfc1 hepKO/Y males by four days. In heterozygous Hcfc1hepKO/+ females， owing to random X-chromosome inactivation， upon Hcfc1hepKO allele induction， a 50/50 mix of HCF-1 positive and negative hepatocyte clusters is engineered. Results: The livers with Hcfc1hepKO/Y hepatocytes displayed a 21â24-day terminal non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) disease progression typical of severe NAFL disease (NAFLD). In contrast， in livers with heterozygous Hcfc1hepKO/+ hepatocytes， HCF-1-positive hepatocytes replaced HCF-1-negative hepatocytes and revealed only mild-NAFL development. Loss of HCF-1 led to loss of PGC1 alpha protein levels， probably owing to its destabilization， and deregulation of gene expression particularly of genes involved in mitochondrial structure and function， likely explaining the severe Hcfc1hepKO/Y liver pathology. Interestingly， although HCF-1 binds to over 5000 transcriptional start sites in the resting liver， expression of only a minor subset of the associated genes was affected by HCF-1 loss. Conclusion: HCF-1 is essential for proper liver physiology likely playing both transcriptional and non-transcriptional roles. These genetically-engineered loss-of-HCF-1 mice represent models for the study of NASH and NAFLD resolution.,Mouse liver samples from male WT， male KO， and female heterorygotes were collected from day zero to day 14 after Tamoxifen injection.

PRC2 proteins EZH1 and EZH2 regulate postnatal hepatic maturation [srHC-seq],GSE119218,Mus musculus,The inability to derive fully functional cell types， such as hepatocytes， from stem cells may emanate from the lack of knowledge about mechanisms that underlie postnatal cell maturation. We characterized hepatic maturation during the postnatal day 14 (P14) to 2-month-old (M2) transition and found more than 3000 genes differentially expressed. Nearly half of such maturation genes have H3K27me3 at their promoters or gene bodies at P14 or M2. Genetic ablation of both PRC2 histone methyltransferases in perinatal livers causes hepatocytes to prematurely differentiate， expressing genes at P14 that would normally be induced later， by M2. Using srHC-seq， a new method to map sonication-resistant heterochromatin， we found that the H3K27me3+ prematurely upregulated genes have euchromatic promoters at P14. We also observed derepression of many non-hepatic lineage genes with euchromatic promoter H3K27me3-marking. Thus， Polycomb repression is used to restrain expression of late liver maturation genes and lineage inappropriate genes at euchromatic promoters.,srHC-seq.  Long and small DNA fragments from sonicated， crosslinked chromatin were size-selected with AMPure XP beads and prepped for sequencing. Examination of a time-course including P14 and M2 hepatocytes using WT mice and P14 was also assessed for Ezh1/2 knockout mice.

Integrative genomic analysis of CREB defines a critical role for transcription factor networks in mediating the fed/fasted switch in liver [ChIP-seq],GSE45674,Mus musculus,Metabolic homeostasis in mammals critically depends on the regulation of fasting-induced genes by CREB in the liver. Previous genome-wide analysis has shown that only a small percentage of CREB target genes are induced in response to fasting-associated signaling pathways. The precise molecular mechanisms by which CREB specifically targets these genes in response to alternating hormonal cues remain to be elucidated. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing of CREB in livers from both fasted and re-fed mice. In order to quantitatively compare the extent of CREB-DNA interactions genome-wide between these two physiological conditions we developed a novel， robust analysis method， termed the âsingle sample independenceâ (SSI) test that greatly reduced the number of false positive peaks. We found that CREB remains constitutively bound to its target genes in the liver regardless of the metabolic state.  Integration of the CREB cistrome with expression microarrays of fasted and re-fed mouse livers and ChIP-seq data for additional transcription factors revealed that the gene expression switches between the fasted and fed states are associated with co-localization of additional transcription factors at CREB sites. Our results support a model in which CREB is constitutively bound to thousands of potential target genes and combinatorial interactions between DNA-binding factors are necessary to achieve the specific transcriptional response of the liver to fasting. Furthermore， our genome-wide analysis identifies thousands of novel CREB target genes in liver， including a previously unknown role for CREB in regulating ER stress genes in response to nutrient influx.,CREB ChIP-seq was performed on mouse liver from fasted and re-fed mice， using 5 separate biological replicates for each condition.

Proliferating SPP1/MERTK-expressing macrophages in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,GSE128033,Homo sapiens,A comprehensive understanding of the changes in gene expression in cell  types involved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) will shed light on the  mechanisms underlying the loss of alveolar epithelial cells， and  development of honeycomb cysts and fibroblastic foci. We sought to  understand changes in IPF lung cell transcriptomes and gain insight into  innate immune aspects of pathogenesis. We investigated IPF  pathogenesis using single cell RNA-sequencing of fresh lung explants，  comparing human IPF fibrotic lower lobes reflecting late disease， upper  lobes reflecting early disease and normal lungs. IPF lower lobes showed  increased fibroblasts， and basal， ciliated， goblet and club cells， but  decreased alveolar epithelial cells， and marked alterations in  inflammatory cells. We found three discrete macrophage subpopulations  in normal and fibrotic lungs， one expressing monocyte markers， one  highly expressing FABP4 and INHBA (FABP4hi)， and one highly  expressing SPP1 and MERTK (SPP1hi). SPP1hi macrophages in fibrotic lower lobes showed highly upregulated SPP1 and MERTK expression. Low-level local proliferation of SPP1hi macrophages in normal lungs was strikingly increased in IPF lungs. Co-localization and causal modeling supported the role for these highly proliferative SPP1hi macrophages in activation of IPF myofibroblasts in lung fibrosis. These data suggest SPP1hi macrophages contribute importantly to lung fibrosis in IPF， and that therapeutic strategies targeting MERTK and macrophage proliferation may show promise for treatment of this disease.,Single cell RNA-Seq 3 Prime gene expression comparison of normal/healthy donor lung tissue with upper IPF lobe tissue and lower IPF lobe tissue.

NASC-seq monitors RNA synthesis in single cells,GSE128273,Homo sapiens,Sequencing of newly synthesized RNA can monitor transcriptional dynamics with great sensitivity and high temporal resolution， but is currently restricted to populations of cells. Here， we develop new transcriptome alkylation-dependent single-cell RNA sequencing (NASC-seq)， to monitor newly synthesized and pre-existing RNA in single cells. We validate the method on pre-alkylated RNA， and by demonstrating that more newly synthesized RNA was detected for genes with known high mRNA turnover. NASC-seq reveals rapidly up- and down-regulated genes during T-cell activation， and RNA arising from induced genes is essentially only newly synthesized. The newly synthesized and pre-existing transcriptomes after T-cell activation are distinct， confirming that we simultaneously measure gene expression at two time points in single cells. Altogether， NASC-seq is an accessible and powerful tool to investigate transcriptional dynamics that enables the precise monitoring of RNA synthesis at flexible time periods during homeostasis， perturbation responses and cellular differentiation.,For each single-cell RNA-seq experiment， 188 single cells were sequenced according to the NASC-seq protocol. The following experiments are included:  exp1: K562 cells were labelled for 60 minutes with 50uM 4sU. Negative controls and unlabelled cells are included in the experiment  exp2: Jurkat cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin and simultaneously labelled with 50uM 4sU for 15 minutes. Negative controls， unlabelled cells and unstimulated cells are included in the experiment.  exp3: Jurkat cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin and simultaneously labelled with 50uM 4sU for 30 minutes.

TT-seq: Jurkat cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 15 or 30 minutes and labelled with 500uM 4sU during the last 5 minutes of stimulation. Biological duplicates of TT-seq samples were sequenced.,31316066,Nat Commun
U1 snRNP regulates chromatin retention of noncoding RNAs,GSE107131,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,RNA subcellular localization often correlates with its function and regulation. For many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and some isoforms of coding genes， their transcripts are preferentially retained on the chromatin. However， the mechanisms controlling the chromatin retention of lncRNAs and mRNA transcripts remain largely unknown. We hypothesize that embedded RNA sequences and interacting proteins may be the cis and trans regulators governing RNA subcellular localization， respectively. To comprehensively identify the cis-regulatory elements of RNA transcript， here we have developed a high-throughput sequencing-based method named RNA elements for subcellular localization by sequencing (REL-seq). Using this method， we identified RNA sequences contribute to the chromatin retention of several transcripts. By combining REL-seq with random mutagenesis (mutREL-seq)， we further narrowed down the key RNA motifs and residues in regulating their subcellular localization at base resolution. Finally， based on the RNA element we identified， we revealed and confirmed U1 snRNA targeting site contributes to RNA chromatin retention.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal differentially subcellular localized RNAs of RSLP library targeted genes.,32238924,Nature

To induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage-like cells， HL-60 cells were stimulated with 50 nM 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) for 2 days. A total of 10^3 A.fumigatus conidia were transferred to 5 Ã 10^4 differentiated HL-60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. After incubating for 0， 1， and 2 hrs， the sample tubes were vigorously agitated with TRIzolÂ® (Invitrogen) containing glass beads to extract total RNA of alive A.fumigatus. ). Libraries were prepared from 2 Âµg of total RNA using a SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Clontech Laboratories， Inc.， USA).

Integrative discovery of treatments for high-risk neuroblastoma,GSE120920,Homo sapiens,Neuroblastoma (NB) cells exhibit a complex spectrum of pathway changes associated with oncogene activation， chromosome events， tumor micro-environment and super-enhancer states.  So far， elucidating which pharmaceutical compounds could modulate the activation level of each known pathway in NB cells has not been feasible. We treated 2 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) NB cell lines with different chemical compounds， at 3 different doses (IC50， IC20， and IC10) and 2 time-points (6 and 24h). The whole-transcriptome of the treated cells was analyzed by a cost-effective DRUG-Seq method. Using factor analysis and supervised machine learning， the data was used to build a model that predicts the NB-specific outcome of 19，000+ drugs studied in other (non-NB) cell lines in several drug profiling databases (LINCS， CMap， DepMap).,Two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) NB cell lines treated with different chemical compounds， at 3 different doses (IC50， IC20， and IC10) and 2 time-points (6 and 24h).Please note that the D1， D2， and D3 (in the sample titles) correspond to IC10， IC20， and IC50， respectively.,31900415,Nat Commun
Titrating gene expression with allelic series of CRISPR guide RNAs,GSE132080,Homo sapiens,Cellular phenotypes arise from the degrees to which different genes are expressed， yet the  ability to monitor these phenotypes is limited by a lack of tools to precisely control gene expression. We  describe the development of allelic series of systematically compromised sgRNAs to titrate expression of human genes with CRISPR interference. Using large-scale measurements of compromised sgRNA activities， we both  identify empirically validated intermediate-activity sgRNAs and derive the factors governing sgRNA activity using deep learning， enabling construction of a compact sgRNA library to titrate expression of ~2，400 essential genes and a genome-wide in silico library. Staging cells along a continuum of essential gene expression levels using sgRNA series  combined with rich single-cell RNA-seq readout reveals expression threshold-specific responses and gene-specific expression-to-phenotype relationships. Our work provides a general tool to control gene expression with applications ranging from tuning of biochemical pathways to identification of suppressors for diseases of dysregulated gene expression.,Pooled CRISPR screening experiment with intermediate-activity sgRNAs conducted via Perturb-seq,31932729,Nat Biotechnol
Cell type atlas and lineage tree of a whole complex animal by single-cell transcriptomics,GSE103633,Schmidtea mediterranea,Flatworms of the species Schmidtea mediterranea are immortal âadult animals contain a large pool of pluripotent stem cells that continuously differentiate to all adult cell types. Therefore， single-cell transcriptome profiling of adult animals should reveal mature and progenitor cells. Here， by combining perturbation experiments， gene expression analysis， a computational method that predicts future cell states from the transcriptional changes， and a novel lineage reconstruction method， we placed all major cell types onto a single lineage tree that connects all cells to a single stem cell compartment. We characterize gene expression changes during differentiation and discover cell types important for regeneration. Our results demonstrate the importance of single-cell transcriptome analysis for mapping and reconstructing fundamental processes of developmental and regenerative biology at unprecedented resolution.,Single cell sequencing by drop-seq of Schmidtea mediterranea whole cells including 2 bulk population wild type samples fixed in methanol， 1 bulk population wild type sample cryopreserved， 2 bulk population wild type alive sample and 2 bulk population after control and Smed-h2b RNAi samples fixed in methanol and 3 wt samples at 3 different regeneration time points (day 0， day 2， day 4) fixed in methanol.,29674432,Science
High-throughput combinatorial indexing enables scalable single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling [human K562 and muring 3T3],GSE130536,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,While recent technical advancements have facilitated the mapping of epigenomes at the single-cell resolution， the throughput and quality of these methods have limited the widespread application of these technologies. Here， we describe a high-throughput platform for single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) using droplet microfluidics that yields essential qualities for high-throughput profiling， including improvements in per-cell library complexity and throughput. This approach enables robust cell-typing of complex tissues and reveals a de novo atlas of cellular and epigenomic diversity across many cell types and cell stages.,A mixture of human K562 and murine 3T3 cells was profiled in various quantities to access cross-talk between cells in our combinatorial setting using 48-plex barcoded Tn5,31235917,Nat Biotechnol

Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis Infection Induces an Immune Tolerance Phenotype in Primary Bovine Macrophages from Johneâs Disease Cows (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada_N.Bissonnette_J000079),GSE98363,Bos taurus,Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johneâs disease (JD)， which is also known as paratuberculosis， in ruminants. The mechanisms of JD pathogenesis are still unclear， but it is known that MAP subverts the host immune system for years by using macrophages as its primary reservoir. The effect of MAP infection on macrophages is often studied in healthy or experimentally infected cows， but reports on primary macrophages from naturally infected cows are lacking. In our study， the transcriptome of primary monocyte-derived macrophages challenged with live MAP was analyzed using next-generation sequencing (RNAâseq). The gene expression signatures of macrophages from cows diagnosed as negative  or positive  for JD [JD(â) or JD(+)， respectively] revealed differential hostâpathogen interplay， highlighting long-term mechanisms established during mycobacterial disease. In JD(â) cows， a considerable number of genes (1，436) were differentially expressed at 8Â h post-infection (hpi). Interestingly， while expected inflammatory immune response pathways were among the significant pathways， others related to Hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation， lipid homeostasis， such as the  LXR/RXR [liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor] activation， and autoimmune diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis were consistently among the top significant pathways. Unexpectedly， the macrophages from JD(+) cows did not present a clear response pattern to ex vivo MAP infection， neither during the early period nor at 24Â hpi. Analyzing of the transcriptomic profile of the uninfected macrophages， revealed 868Â genes that were differentially expressed in JD(+) versus JD(â) cows. The down-regulated genes particularly modified the general cell metabolism by down-regulating amino acid synthesis， cholesterol biosynthesis， and other energy production pathways while introducing a pro-fibrotic pattern associated with foam cells. These modifications show the apparent importance of the metabolic pathways hijacked by MAP to subvert the immune cells. Our findings support the hypothesis that MAP could induce a tolerant-like state in circulating peripheral blood monocytes when they are differentiating into macrophages， which could further promote the persistence. Similar to other mycobacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns， MAP could influence macrophage behavior in the long term. This report contributes to a better understanding of MAP control of immune cells and its mechanisms of survival.,A total of 12 dairy cows were selected for RNA-seq analysis.

RNA-seq， ChIP-seq and TERRA CHIRT-seq from p53-/- iPS infected with a lentiviral virus carrying a control scrambled shRNA or shRNA against TRF1,GSE121759,Mus musculus,The mechanisms that regulate pluripotency and cell fate are still largely unknown. Here， we show that the Telomere Repeat Binding Factor 1 (TRF1)， a component of the shelterin telomere protection complex， regulates genome-wide binding of polycomb to stem cell and pluripotency genes， thereby exerting vast epigenetic changes that contribute to maintain embryonic stem cells in a naÃ¯ve state. We further show that TRF1 mediates these effects by regulating TERRA， the long-non-coding RNAs transcribed from telomeres and that are part of the telomeric chromatin. In particular， we find that TERRAs are enriched at polycomb and stem cell genes in pluripotent cells and that TRF1 abrogation results in increased TERRA levels and a higher binding of TERRA to those genes， an event that is coincidental with TRF1-dependent induction of cell-fate programs and loss of the naÃ¯ve state. These results are consistent with a model in which TERRA recruits polycomb to genes important for pluripotency and differentiation in a manner that is dependent on TRF1. These unprecedented findings explain the long-standing observation that TRF1 is one of the most upregulated genes during induction of pluripotency and it is essential for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency.,p53-/- iPS cells were infected with lentivirus encoding a control shRNA or a shRNA against TRF1. After two days selection with puromycin， RNA or chromatin was obtained to perform the next techniques. From RNA-seqs， two independent experiments were performed so 2 different control samples and two different condition samples were analyzed. A single experiment was analyzed for the ChIP-seqs， sending one sample for the control and one for the condition sample. The ChIPs against the following proteins were performed: Suz12， H3K27me3 and TRF1. As control， a mix of the input of the control and the condition samples was sequenced. For the CHIRT-seq against TERRA， the sample from the control condition and the original input were sequenced.,31426913,Elife
ARID1A and the BAF complex are determinants of breast cancer treatment response [ChIP-seq],GSE123284,Homo sapiens,Global CRISPR screens provide an unparalleled， longer-term experimental approach for the identification of essential genes in drug resistance. We used an ~18，000 gene deletion screen to discover ARID1A and other BAF complex components as the most critical factors required for response to two classes of Estrogen Receptor (ER) antagonists， namely ER degraders and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). Unexpectedly， ARID1A was also the top candidate for response to the BET inhibitor JQ1， but in the opposite direction， where loss of ARID1A sensitised breast cancer cells to BET inhibition. We show that ARIDA binds chromatin at ER cis-regulatory elements and can physically associate with ER in model systems and primary tumour samples. ARID1A binding to ER enhancer elements， can occur in the absence of ER， suggesting that its repressive activity occurs in an enhancer-specific， but ER-independent manner. Specific targeting of ARID1A validated the CRISPR screen and shows that depletion of BAF activity， does not result in redundancy from P-BAF， the other ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex， but instead results in loss of HDAC1 binding， increased Histone 4 lysine acetylation and subsequent BRD4-driven growth. ARID1A and the BAF complex therefore function as a critical mechanism of antiestrogen activity and mutation or depletion in BAF activity drives a BRD4-mediated proliferative program that is refractory to ER targeted agents. Since ARID1A is mutated in a subset of treatment-resistant disease， these findings provide mechanistic insight and treatment strategies for patients， based on BAF complex fidelity status.,Examination of ARID1A， BRG1 and SNF5 binding sites in asynchronous MCF7 cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 100 nM 4-Hydroxytamoxifen， 250 nM JQ1 and 10 nM Fulvestrant for 6 hours or double times charcoal stripped serum (DCDT)- treated cells for 72 hours and treated with Vehicle or 10 nM b-estradiol for 6 hours.

Tox reinforces the phenotype and longevity of dysfunctional T cell populations during chronic viral infection [ToxKO vs WT Day 20],GSE132032,Mus musculus,Chronic CD8 T-cell stimulation in persisting infections or tumors can induce a stable gene expression program， known as T-cell dysfunction or exhaustion， that limits the cellâs effector functions and anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. Thus far， the underlaying molecular mechanisms that induce and stabilize this phenotype are vaguely understood. We report here that establishing this program requires the thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group-box protein (Tox). Genetic disruption of Tox augments effector function， decreases the expression of PD-1， and significantly enhances immunopathology. These changes are linked to a failure in fixing the dysfunctional phenotype in the critical Tcf1+ progenitor population and to impaired epigenetic programing. Surprisingly， the gains in effector function co-incide with declining numbers of Tcf1+ cells and result ultimately in reduced total numbers of pathogen-specific T-cells. Thus， we establish Tox as a critical factor for the development of T-cell dysfunction and establish a clear link between CD8 T-cell intrinsic suppression of effector function and protection against immune-pathology.,2*10^3 wt or Toxâ P14 T-cells were transferred into C57BL6 host， infected with 5x10^6 PFU LCMV-c13 and collected on day 20.

Kdm5b depletion in embryonic stem cells does not induce intragenic promoters or affect transcription [RNA-Seq],GSE63285,Mus musculus,The application of massively-parallel sequencing (MPS) technology to understanding how the genome is regulated is of major importance， as we now appreciate sequence variants associated with common heritable diseases to be enriched at regulatory elements in the genome.  There is， however， an enormous challenge inherent to these studies， which are much more varied as assays and in terms of analytical approaches than the approaches Â used to define the sequence variants themselves.  For example， there areis a plethora of assays that test 5-methylcytosine genome-wide， numerous different analytical approaches to defineing peaks from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)， and increasingly diverse aspects of genomic regulation being studied.  The extremely large data sets generated do not lend themselves to distribution without some degree of pre-processing， and the hardware requirements for running these analyses are often substantial.  We have highlighted these concerns previously， but the central concern for our field is that genomics research is especially prone to poor reproducibility， and is a prime candidate for implementation of measures that could help to address this general problem.To illustrate the practical issues involved in genomics reproducibility， we sought to analyze our and three previoulsy published studies of the histone demethylase KDM5B using the same analytical approaches.,mRNA profile of mES cells after Kdm5b knock down,nan,

Comprehensive epigenome characterization reveals the diverse transcriptional regulation across human vascular endothelial cells (ChIP-seq),GSE131953,Homo sapiens,Endothelial cells (ECs) make up the innermost layer throughout the entire vasculature. Their phenotypes and physiological functions are initially regulated by developmental signals and extracellular stimuli. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse phenotypes of ECs from different organs are not well understood.To characterize the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape in the vascular system， we cataloged gene expression and active histone marks in nine types of human ECs (generating 148 genome-wide datasets) and carried out a comprehensive analysis with chromatin interaction data. We developed a robust procedure for comparative epigenome analysis that circumvents variations at the level of the individual and technical noise derived from sample preparation under various conditions. Through this approach， we identified 3765 EC-specific enhancers， some of which were associated with disease-associated genetic variations. We also identified various candidate marker genes for each EC type. We found that the nine EC types can be divided into two subgroups， corresponding to those with upper-body origins and lower-body origins， based on their epigenomic landscape. Epigenomic variations were highly correlated with gene expression patterns， but also provided unique information. Most of the deferentially expressed genes and enhancers were cooperatively enriched in more than one EC type， suggesting that the distinct combinations of multiple genes play key roles in the diverse phenotypes across EC types. This comprehensive analysis of epigenome characterization of EC types reveals diverse transcriptional regulation across human vascular systems. These datasets provide a valuable resource for understanding the vascular system and associated diseases.,ChIP-Seq experiments were conducted in human vascular endothelial cells.

After examination of the quality (Bioanalyzer， Agilent) and quantity (NanoDrop 2000， ThermoFisher) of each RNA sample， aliquots of total RNA were submitted to the Genomics Core Facility at Penn State University for cDNA library preparation and next generation sequencing on a Hiseq 2500 (Illumina). Approximately 40 million 150 bp single-end sequencing reads were obtained for each library.,29216416,Plant Cell Environ
Long non-coding RNA RP11-19E11.1 is an E2F1 target required for tumor cell proliferation and survival in basal breast cancer,GSE138606,Homo sapiens,Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in the regulation of breast cancer initiation and progression. LncRNAs are differentially expressed in breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast cancers are generally poorly differentiated tumors， are enriched in embryonic stem cell signatures， lack expression of estrogen receptor， progesterone receptor， and HER2 (triple negative breast cancer， TNBC)， and show activation of proliferation-associated factors. We hypothesized that lncRNAs are key regulators of basal breast cancers. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas we identified lncRNAs that are overexpressed in basal tumors compared to other breast cancer subtypes and expressed in at least 10% of patients. Remarkably， we identified lncRNAs whose expression correlated with patient prognosis. We then evaluated the function of a subset of lncRNA candidates in the oncogenic process in vitro. Here， we report the identification and characterization of the chromatin-associated lncRNA， RP11-19E11.1， which is up-regulated in 40% of basal primary breast cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis in primary tumors and in cell lines uncovered a correlation between RP11-19E11.1 expression level and the E2F oncogenic pathway. We show that this lncRNA is chromatin-associated and an E2F1 target， and its expression is necessary for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Finally， we used lncRNA expression levels as a tool for drug discovery in vitro， identifying Protein Kinase C (PKC) as a potential therapeutic target for a subset of basal-like breast cancers. Our findings suggest lncRNA overexpression is clinically relevant. Understanding deregulated lncRNA expression in basal-like breast cancer may lead to potential prognostic and therapeutic applications.,RNA-seq data from HCC38， MDA-MB-468 and SUM149PT was obtained in duplicate after RP11-19E11.1 KD.,31934613,NPJ Breast Cancer
NET-seq analysis of pSer2-Pol II profile in shCTRL， shMETTL3 and shDDX21 HeLa cells,GSE134102,Homo sapiens,The chromatin fraction was isolated from 5x107 HeLa cells. Chromatin was digested in 100 mL of MNase (40 units/ mL ) reaction buffer for 3 min at 37 Â°C in a thermomixer (1，400 rpm). After addition of 10 ï­L EGTA (25mM) to inactivate MNase， soluble digested chromatin was collected by 13，000 rpm centrifuge for 5 min. 10 mg of Pol II antibody was conjugated to magnetic protein A beads. The supernatant was diluted with 400 mL of NET-2 buffer and pSer2-Pol II antibody-conjugated beads were added. Incubated the IP reaction at 4 Â°C for 1 hr. The beads were washed with 1 mL of NET-2 buffer six times and 100 mL of 1xPNKT (1xPNK buffer and 0.05% Triton X-100) buffer once.

DUX-miR-344-ZMYM2-mediated activation of MERVL LTRs induces a totipotent 2C-like state [RNA-seq],GSE119819,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) sporadically express preimplantation two-cell-stage (2C) transcripts， including MERVL endogenous retrovirus and Zscan4 cluster genes. Such 2C-like cells (2CLCs) can contribute to both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues when reintroduced into early embryos. We examined global nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in 2CLCs and identified miR-344 as the noncoding molecule that positively controls 2CLC potency. We found that activation of endogenous MERVL or miR-344-2 alone is sufficient to induce 2CLCs with induction of 2C genes and an expanded potency. Mechanistically， miR-344 is activated by the 2C-state driver DUX and post-transcriptionally represses ZMYM2 and LSD1， which recruit the HDAC corepressor to MERVL LTR for transcriptional repression.

Kdm5b depletion in embryonic stem cells does not induce intragenic promoters or affect transcription [ChIP-Seq],GSE63286,Mus musculus,The application of massively-parallel sequencing (MPS) technology to understanding how the genome is regulated is of major importance， as we now appreciate sequence variants associated with common heritable diseases to be enriched at regulatory elements in the genome.  There is， however， an enormous challenge inherent to these studies， which are much more varied as assays and in terms of analytical approaches than the approaches Â used to define the sequence variants themselves.  For example， there are a plethora of assays that test 5-methylcytosine genome-wide， numerous different analytical approaches to defineing peaks from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)， and increasingly diverse aspects of genomic regulation being studied.  The extremely large data sets generated do not lend themselves to distribution without some degree of pre-processing， and the hardware requirements for running these analyses are often substantial.  We have highlighted these concerns previously， but the central concern for our field is that genomics research is especially prone to poor reproducibility， and is a prime candidate for implementation of measures that could help to address this general problem. To illustrate the practical issues involved in genomics reproducibility， we sought to analyze our data and data from three previoulsy published studies of the histone demethylase KDM5B using the same analytical approaches. In particular we compared the results of our ChIP-seq experiments to previous H3K4me3 and Kdm5b ChIP-seq data in the public database: GSE31966 and GSE53087 (only samples GSM1282126， GSM1282127， GSM1282129， GSM1282131， and GSM1282132).

Activity-by-Contact model of enhancer specificity from thousands of CRISPR perturbations [ChIP-Seq],GSE124193,Mus musculus,Mammalian genomes harbor millions of noncoding elements called enhancers that quantitatively regulate gene expression， but the mechanisms that determine which enhancers regulate which genes are not well understood. Here we describe a high-throughput approach， based on CRISPR interference， RNA FISH， and flow cytometry (CRISPRi-FlowFISH)， to perturb enhancers in the genome and apply it to test >3，000 potential regulatory enhancer-gene connections across multiple genomic loci. Seemingly complex patterns of enhancer-gene connections in this dataset can largely be explained by a simple quantitative Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model， in which the effect of a candidate enhancer on a target gene is predicted by the intrinsic activity of the enhancer multiplied by the contact frequency between the enhancer and promoter. This ABC score can identify regulatory enhancer-gene connections and predict their quantitative effects from DNase-Seq， H3K27ac ChIP-seq， and Hi-C measurements. The ABC model can explain even complex regulatory phenomena including the ability of an enhancer to âskipâ over one gene to regulate a more distant one. Our approach provides a foundation for dissecting mechanisms of enhancer-gene regulation and predicting enhancer-gene connections across cell types.,H3K27ac ChIP-seq was used to profile F2-1 mESCs in 2 technical replicates.,31784727,Nat Genet
Genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility governing the transition from founder cells to distinct fate-restricted cardiopharyngeal precursors,GSE126691,Ciona robusta,We used the assay for transposon-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on FACS-purified cells to profile chromatin accessibility during early cardiopharyngeal fate choices in Ciona.  We obtained ~500 million unique reads from samples comprising cardiopharyngeal mesoderm and mesenchymal cells， as well as whole Ciona embryos and genomic DNA control. We combined ATAC-seq peaks from all the replicates to generate an atlas of 56，090 unique and non-overlapping accessible regions (accessome) covering 9.25% of the C. robusta genome. We used the accessome to analyze differential accessibility and integrated expression data to compare the chromatin and gene expression dynamics underlying cardiopharyngeal fate specification. In summary， we revealed that most changes in accessibility occur upon induction of multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors from the founder cells. Comparing differential expression to differential accessibility shows that genes activated in the multipotent progenitors tend to have regions that specifically open nearby them. We found that the elements accessible specifically in multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors were enriched in Fox， GATA and nuclear receptor binding motifs. CRISPR-mediated loss of Foxf function followed by FACS， ATAC-seq and RNA-seq showed that Foxf is required to open ~22% of the cardiopharyngeal-specific elements. Notably， elements associated with de novo expressed genes， which turn on either in heart or pharyngeal muscle progenitors， were also opening in multipotent progenitors， whereas only ~10% of differentially expressed genes had differentially accessible elements. Finally， we propose a general model for chromatin dynamics whereby most lineage-specific elements open in multipotent progenitors， and control both early pan-cardiopharyngeal and late cell-type-specific expression.,"Examination of 52 ATAC-seq samples: we collected ~4，000 cells per independent replicate for samples from embryos dissociated at five time points encompassing cardiopharyngeal development: naive Mesp+ mesoderm (aka founder cells) at 6 hours post-fertilization， hpf)， anterior tail muscle (aka ATMs)， first and second multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors (aka trunk ventral cells， TVCs) at 10hpf，  fate-restricted progenitors obtained from larvae dissociated at three time points (15， 18 and 20hpf) encompassing second multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors (and aka STVCs)， as well as fate-restricted first and second heart precursors (FHPs and SHPs)， and pharyngeal muscle precursors (aka atrial siphon muscle cells -ASMs). From the same dissociated embryos embryonic cell populations， we isolated B-line mesenchymal cells at 10， 15， 18， and 20hpf. We also collected samples from whole embryo at 10hpf and genomic DNA as input control. We obtained FACS-purified cells at 10hpf after inducing loss of Foxf function using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis (FoxfCRISPR â 10hpf). We examined 6 RNA-seq samples from FoxfCRISPR and ControlCRISPR at 10hpf.B7.5 = cardiopharyngeal mesoderm precursorsThe ""new"" ATAC-seq method includes addition of EDTA quenching to block the tagmentation reaction (i.e. 1.1  l of 500mM EDTA (final concentration approx. 50mM， incubating at 50  C for 30mins).

Transcriptomic characterization of a mixed population of pluripotent stem cell derived cerebellar neuron-like progenitors,GSE65423,Homo sapiens,We set out to ascertain whether it was possible to use PSCs (pluripotent stem cells) to generate a mix of neuronal cell types resembling those in the cerebellum， most notably Purkinje and granule cells. Several groups have previously demonstrated generation of cerebellar-like neuronal cells from murine ESCs (embryonic stem cells)， and more recently the Erceg group achieved similar success using human PSCs. Using principles from these studies we successfully induced expression of midâhindbrain markers EN1 & GBX2 and later MATH1 (a transcription factor which marks rhombic lip/granule cell progenitors) in a mixed neuronal population derived from hPSCs. Further， we show that it is possible to expand these progenitors to produce spontaneously active neuronal cells with morphological similarities to neuronal cells at specific stages of cerebellar development. Based on morphology， electrophysiology， immunohistochemistry and transcriptomic analysis we demonstrate that these cells express behavior， markers and molecular signatures consistent with distinct epochs of cerebellar development spanning from the late embryonic to early postnatal periods. This study describes an in vitro model that provides insight into the early events that drive the formation of the human cerebellum with support from a high-resolution survey of the trancriptomic landscape， including expression of non-coding RNAs and specific transcript isoforms. The generated datasets and accompanying characterization are a valuable resource for researchers to formulate and test hypotheses regarding the molecular players that are involved in the formation of the cerebellum,Total RNA-seq profiles of undifferentiated iPS cells and cerebellar neuron-like differentiated cells were generated by deep RNA sequencing， in triplicate， using a HiSeq2500 in Rapid Run mode.,nan,
STAT4 activation by leukemia inhibitory factor confers a therapeutic effect on intestinal inflammation [RNA-Seq],GSE124077,Mus musculus,We report that microbiota dysregulation promotes LIF secretion by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in a mouse colitis model. LIF greatly activates STAT4 phosphorylation on multiple SPXX elements within the C-terminal transcription regulation domain. STAT4 and STAT3 act reciprocally on both canonical cis-inducible elements (SIEs) and noncanonical âAGGâ elements at different loci. In lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs)， STAT4 activation by LIF blocks STAT3-dependent Il-17a/Il-17f promoter activation， whereas in IECs， LIF bypasses the extraordinarily low level of STAT4 to induce YAP gene expression via STAT3 activation. In addition， we found that the administration of LIF is sufficient to restore microbiome homeostasis. Thus， LIF effectively inhibits Th17 accumulation and promotes repair of damaged intestinal epithelium in inflamed colon， and serves as a potential therapy for IBD.,mRNA profiles in intestinal epithelial cells of wild type (WT) and Stat4-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing， in duplicate， using Illumina-HiSeq2500/4000.,30770344,EMBO J
Genomic repeats coordinate macroscopic gene function and expression,GSE125766,Mus musculus,Despite abundant distribution of repetitive elements， the roles they have been coopted in mammalian genomes are insufficiently characterized. Here we reveal a pervasive role for genic repeat in shaping macroscopic gene function and expression in both human and mouse. Specifically， genes enriched in SINE， L1 and simple repeat produce proteins with functions in distinct categories. To maintain/regulate the homeostatic expression of gene with diversified functions， SINE and L1 are targeted by different classes of transcriptional regulators and also show a nonrandom genomic and nuclear distribution， with B1 in the nuclear interior and L1 in the nuclear and nucleolar peripheries. Abnormal expression of L1-enriched gene compromise proliferation of embryonic stem cells. Moreover， L1 transcripts tend to bind L1-enriched genes， transacting L1 DNA information and mainly function as transcriptional repressors. These results demonstrate that genomic repeats have subtly shaped the function of host-gene they embedded in， and provide a paradigm shift in understanding function of genomic âparasitesâ in their host-genome.,ChIRP-seq of L1 and Malat1 RNA,32160538,Cell Rep

Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data from melanocytes driven by tumor cell-derived exosomes,GSE84683,Homo sapiens,Exosomes (40â100 nm) are organelle-like membranous structures shed into interstitial spaces and body fluids under diverse pathophysiologic conditions， including tumor development. The tumor microenvironment is abundant with exosomes secreted by the cancer cells themselves. Studies have shown that tumor-derived exosomes can transport RNA and active molecules to other cells to promote tumor growth. Exosomes are increasingly being recognized as a major contributor in the progression of malignant neoplasms.  We have found that normal melanocytes can acquire invasiveness through the internalization of melanoma cell-derived exosomes.  However， little is known about how the exosomes modulate the melanocytes in the microenvironment to optimize conditions for tumor progression and metastasis.  We hypothesize that melanoma cell-derived exosomes can drive the dysregulation of transcriptomes in normal melanocytes and facilitate melanoma progression. Our objective is to identify differentially expressed genes in melanocytes driven by tumor cell-derived exosomes through RNA sequencing and translate those genes as therapeutic targets for melanoma metastasis.,Total RNA was extracted from three groups of human melanocytes: NHEM-c melanocytes without exosomes (control group)， NHEM-c melanocytes co-cultured with A375 melanoma cell-derived exosomes， and NHEM-c melanocytes co-cultured with A549 lung cancer cellderived exosomes.,31678172,Exp Cell Res
Global analysis of enhancer targets: Bulk RNA-Seq validation,GSE129825,Homo sapiens,Single-cell perturbation assays such as Mosaic-seq enable highly multiplexed functional assessment of enhancers in their endogenous genomic context. By introducing a few computational and experimental improvements， we expanded the Mosaic-seq analysis to capture the secondary gene targets of enhancers. Our analysis of >500 putative enhancers in K562 cells demonstrates that many secondary hits are shared among enhancers targeting different transcriptional factors， which reveals an interwoven enhancer-driven gene regulatory network. Together， our data underscore the flexibility of manipulating gene transcription by modifying enhancer activity.,In order to validate the differentiated expressed genes identified in the Mosaic-seq experiment， we performed bulk RNA-seq for two enhancer regions， including the enhancer of ARL15 gene (ARL15-enh) and the third enhancer for the MYB gene (MYB-enh-3). For sample preparation， K562-dCas9-KRAB cells were infected with all 10 sgRNAs from each region， respectively. In addition， two non-targeting sgRNAs were used as the negative control.

Super-enhancer-guided decoding of gene regulatory networks in trophoblast stem cells,GSE110950,Mus musculus,Cells belonging to trophoblast lineage are required for proper implantation and placentation， as well as the vascular， hematopoietic， and immunological properties of the placenta， a crucial organ mediating dynamic interactions between maternal and fetal tissues. Defects in trophoblast lineage development can cause early pregnancy failure or other pregnancy-related disorders. Despite its pivotal roles， the placenta remains as one of the least studied organs. Until now， only a handful of trophoblast-specific transcription factors (TFs) have been characterized， and underlying regulatory mechanisms modulating trophoblast lineage development remain poorly understood. Here we explore trophoblast stem cell (TSC)-specific super-enhancers (SEs) and subsequently identify SE-associated factors enriched with previously known and many unknown TFs modulating trophoblast lineage development. By mapping direct targets of 28 TSC-specific TFs in TSCs， we construct highly intertwined transcriptional regulatory networks where TFs are co-regulated and linked with signaling pathways， and which function as cellular modules dedicated to trophoblast lineage development. Additionally， we reveal that TSC-specific TFs alter their target sites corresponding to the reshaped enhancers during TSC differentiation. These findings advance our understanding on placenta biology.,ChIP sequenicngs were performed for p300， Med12， various trophoblast-specific transcription factors， and diverse histone marks using native antibodies in self-renewing and differentiated trophoblast stem cells (TSCs).

DUX-miR-344-ZMYM2-mediated activation of MERVL LTRs induces a totipotent 2C-like state [ATAC-seq],GSE119817,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) sporadically express preimplantation two-cell-stage (2C) transcripts， including MERVL endogenous retrovirus and Zscan4 cluster genes.

EXOSC10 sculpts the transcriptome during oocyte growth-to-maturation transition,GSE141190,Mus musculus,Growing mammalian oocytes accumulate substantial amounts of RNA， most of which are degraded during the subsequent maturation stage. The growth-to-maturation transition begins with germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD， envisioned as nuclear envelope breakdown) and is critical for oocyte quality. However， the concomitant changes in the transcriptome during GVBD as well as the underlying machinery remained unclear. Here， we report that an RNA exosome-associated RNase， EXOSC10， sculpts the transcriptome at multiple level to facilitate the oocyte growth-to-maturation transition. We establish an oocyte-specific knockout of Exosc10 in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 and find female subfertility due to failed GVBD. By performing single oocyte RNA-seq in different ways， we document dysregulated transcriptomes， unsuccessfully processed rRNAs in mutant oocytes， and many up-regulated RNAs that encode proteins important for endomembrane trafficking， meiotic cell cycle and RNA metabolism. EXOSC10-depleted oocytes have impaired endomembrane components including endosome， lysosome， ER and Golgi. In addition， CDK1 fails to be activated possibly due to persistent WEE1 activity， which blocked lamina phosphorylation and disassembly in mutant oocytes. Collectively， we propose that EXOSC10 promotes the growth-to-maturation transition in mouse oocytes by degrading mRNAs that encode growth-phase factors and sculpting the transcriptome to support the maturation phase of oogenesis.,There are 64 single oocyte polyA-RNA libraries generated with poly(A)-based enrichment and reverse transcription， including 22 at GV stage， 19 at GV+3hr stage， and 23 at MII stage.

DUX-miR-344-ZMYM2-mediated activation of MERVL LTRs induces a totipotent 2C-like state [LSD1 ChIP-seq],GSE142280,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) sporadically express preimplantation two-cell-stage (2C) transcripts， including MERVL endogenous retrovirus and Zscan4 cluster genes. Such 2C-like cells (2CLCs) can contribute to both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues when reintroduced into early embryos. We examined global nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in 2CLCs and identified miR-344 as the noncoding molecule that positively controls 2CLC potency. We found that activation of endogenous MERVL or miR-344-2 alone is sufficient to induce 2CLCs with induction of 2C genes and an expanded potency. Mechanistically， miR-344 is activated by the 2C-state driver DUX and post-transcriptionally represses ZMYM2 and LSD1， which recruit the HDAC corepressor to MERVL LTR for transcriptional repression. Consistently， zygotic depletion of Zmym2 compromises the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition during early development. Our studies establish the novel DUXmiR-344--|Zmym2/LsdSD1 axis that controls MERVL for expanded stem cell potency.,Genome binding/occupancy profiling of Zmym2 was performed in ESCs by ChIP sequencing.,32032525,Cell Stem Cell

Tailoring a global iron regulon to a uropathogen,GSE145424,Escherichia coli CFT073,Pathogenicity islands and plasmids encode genes for pathogenesis of various Escherichia coli pathotypes.Although there is a basic understanding of the contribution of these virulence factors to disease， less is known about variation in regulatory networks in determining disease phenotypes. Here we dissected aregulatory network directed by the conserved iron homeostasis regulator， Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur)， inuropathogenic E. coli strain CFT073. Comparing anaerobic genome-scale Fur DNA binding， with Fur dependent transcript expression and protein levels of the uropathogen to that of commensal E. coli K-12 strain MG1655， showed that the Fur regulon of the core genome is conserved but also includes genes within the pathogenicity/genetic islands. Unexpectedly， regulons indicative of amino acid limitation and the general stress response were also indirectly activated in the uropathogen fur mutant， suggesting that induction of the Fur regulon increases amino acid demand. Using RpoS levels as a proxy， addition of amino acids mitigated the stress. In addition， iron chelation increased RpoS to the same levels as in the fur mutant. The increased amino acid demand of the fur mutant or iron chelated cells was exacerbated by aerobic conditions， which could be partly explained by the O2-dependent synthesis of the siderophore aerobactin， encoded within a pathogenicity island. Taken together， this data suggest in the iron-poor environment of the urinary tract， amino acid availability could play a role in the proliferation of this uropathogen， particularly if there is sufficient O2 to produce aerobactin.,Four RNA-seq samples each with three biological replicates were analyzed (WT， deltaFur， deltaRhyB， deltaFur_deltaRhyB).

Activity-by-Contact model of enhancer specificity from thousands of CRISPR perturbations [RNA-Seq mouse],GSE118878,Mus musculus,Mammalian genomes harbor millions of noncoding elements called enhancers that quantitatively regulate gene expression， but the mechanisms that determine which enhancers regulate which genes are not well understood. Here we describe a high-throughput approach， based on CRISPR interference， RNA FISH， and flow cytometry (CRISPRi-FlowFISH)， to perturb enhancers in the genome and apply it to test >3，000 potential regulatory enhancer-gene connections across multiple genomic loci. Seemingly complex patterns of enhancer-gene connections in this dataset can largely be explained by a simple quantitative Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model， in which the effect of a candidate enhancer on a target gene is predicted by the intrinsic activity of the enhancer multiplied by the contact frequency between the enhancer and promoter. This ABC score can identify regulatory enhancer-gene connections and predict their quantitative effects from DNase-Seq， H3K27ac ChIP-seq， and Hi-C measurements. The ABC model can explain even complex regulatory phenomena including the ability of an enhancer to âskipâ over one gene to regulate a more distant one. Our approach provides a foundation for dissecting mechanisms of enhancer-gene regulation and predicting enhancer-gene connections across cell types.,We developed a genetic approach based on classical cis-trans tests to distinguish between (i) primary effects on the expression of nearby genes resulting from direct local functions of an enhancer and (ii) secondary effects on nearby genes resulting from indirect downstream consequences of one of the cis targets influencing another gene in the region. We generated clonal cell lines carrying heterozygous genetic modifications at enhancer loci and compared the expression of nearby genes within 1 megabase on the cis and trans alleles (i.e.， on the modified and unmodified homologous chromosomes) in the same cells. Changes in neighboring gene expression that involve only the cis allele likely result from local functions， while changes that involve both the cis and trans alleles likely result as downstream effects of non-local functions. We performed genetic modifications in 129/Castaneus F1 hybrid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that contain ~1 polymorphic site every 140 basepairs (bp)， enabling us to distinguish the two alleles using RNA sequencing， and we checked for consistency between knockouts on each genetic background to control for potential haplotype-specific effects. We initially characterized allele-specific gene expression using RNA sequencing combined with hybrid selection.,31784727,Nat Genet
Electronic cigarettes,GSE118431,Homo sapiens,Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have gained their popularity as a substitute for cigarettes or cigars. Despite the widespread use of flavoring chemicals in e-cigarettes， the health impacts of the flavoring compounds， in particular their effects on critical cellular function in the lung， remain largely unknown. The goal of this study was to identify transcriptomic changes and impacted biological pathways in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) exposed to flavoring chemicals (diacetyl or 2，3-pentanedione) and to flavored e-cigarette smoke.An airway-liquid interface culturing method was used to differentiate primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) into mature epithelial cells， which were then treated with 25 ppm diacetyl， 100 ppm 2，3 pentanedione， or e-cigarette smoke solution containing 2 ppm diacetyl. Poly(A)-selected RNA-Seq libraries were prepared with the PrepX RNA-Seq for Illumina Library kit. An Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument was used to generate 50 base pair single-end reads. STAR was used to align sequencing reads to the hg38 reference genome， and HTSeq was used to quantify transcript levels. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis.,Transcriptome profiles obtained via RNA-Seq for normal human bronchial epithelium cells (3-donor pool) treated in duplicate with 25 ppm diacetyl， 100 ppm 2，3 pentanedione， e-cigarette smoke solution containing 2 ppm diacetylor， or vehicle control for 24 hours were obtained to measure the effects of exposure to e-cigarette smoke and its flavoring chemicals.,30710127,Sci Rep
CITEseq of human PBMC from healthy adult blood,GSE144434,Homo sapiens,The development of single cell transcriptomic technologies yields large datasets comprising multimodal informations such as transcriptomes and immunophenotypes.  Currently however， there is no software to easily and simultaneously analyze both types of data. Here， we introduce Single-Cell Virtual Cytometer， an open-source software for flow cytometry-like visualization and exploration of multi-omics single cell datasets. Using an original CITE-seq dataset of PBMC from an healthy donor， we illustrate its use for the integrated analysis of transcriptomes and epitopes of functional maturation in peripheral T lymphocytes from healthy donors. So this free and open-source algorithm constitutes a unique resource for biologists seeking for a user-friendly analytic tool for multimodal single cell datasets.,peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by sedimentation on Lymphopure TM (BioLegend) and labelled with 5 TotalSeq TM -A antibody mixes (to CD14， CD16， CD19， CD3， CD4， CD45， CD45RA， CD62L， CD8 and isotype controls) .

RNA editing enzyme APOBEC3A promotes pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization,GSE146867,Homo sapiens,Macrophages acquire a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in response to microbial products or pro-inflammatory cytokines through incompletely understood molecular mechanisms. We recently described the induction of APOBEC3A-mediated cellular site-specific cytosine-to-uracil (C>U) RNA editing during M1 macrophage polarization. However， the functional significance of this RNA editing is unknown. Here， we find that cellular RNA editing by APOBEC3A can also be induced by influenza or Maraba virus infections in normal macrophages， and by interferons in tumor-associated macrophages. Gene knockdown and RNA Seq analyses show that APOBEC3A induces C>U RNA editing (range 7%-88%) of 209 exonic or UTR sites in 203 genes during M1 polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages. The highest level of deleterious protein-recoding C>U RNA editing is observed in THOC5， which encodes a key nuclear protein implicated in the export of mRNAs during M-CSF driven macrophage differentiation. Knockdown of APOBEC3A in M1 macrophages reduces pro-inflammatory IL6， IL23A， and IL12B gene expression， CD80 and CD86 surface protein expression， and TNF-Î±， IL-1Î² and IL-6 cytokine secretion， and increases glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. These results demonstrate that APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase plays an important role in transcriptomic and functional polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages.,9 RNAseq samples; 3M0， 3 A3A-KD and 3 Scrambled,33483601,Commun Biol

Instead， for trisomic genes with low-to-average expression， their altered gene dosage was mainly due to the higher fraction of trisomic cells simultaneously expressing these genes， in agreement with a stochastic 2-state burst-like model of transcription. These results， confirmed in a further analysis of 8740 single fibroblasts， suggest that the specific transcriptional profile of each gene contributes to the phenotypic variability of trisomies.  We propose an improved model to understand the effects of CNA and， more generally， of gene regulation on gene dosage imbalance.,Single-cell RNA seq study on 9668 human fibroblasts in different Trisomies， in order to investigate gene dosage imbalance mechanisms.This study make use of some data already published in GSE123028 (mosT18， mosT8 and most of twins) and newly produced data (mos13， mos21). the processed.data file contains the processing of all trisomies in the context of the new manuscript.

Worker antennal gene expression in Solenopsis invicta identifies candidate genes for queen discrimination (Clontech_lib_RNA-seq),GSE126673,Solenopsis invicta,Queen discrimination behavior in the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta maintains its two types of societies: colonies with one (monogyne) or many (polygyne) queens， yet the underlying genetic mechanism is poorly understood. This behavior is controlled by two supergene alleles， SB and Sb， with ~600 genes. Polygyne workers， having either the SB/SB or SB/Sb genotype， accept additional SB/Sb queens into their colonies but kill SB/SB queens. While monogyne workers， all SB/SB， reject all additional queens regardless of genotype. Because the SB and Sb alleles do not recombine， it is difficult to determine which genes within the supergene mediate this differential worker behavior. We hypothesized that the alternate worker genotypes sense queens differently because of different patterns of gene expression in their main sensory organ， the antennae. To identify such differentially expressed genes， we sequenced RNA from four biological replicates of pooled antennae from three groups of workers: monogyne SB/SB， polygyne SB/SB， and polygyne SB/Sb. We identified 81 differentially expressed protein coding genes with 14 encoding potential odor metabolism and perception proteins. We focused on the two differentially expressed odorant perception genes: an odorant binding protein SiOBP12 and an odorant receptor SiOR463. We found that the SiOR463 was lost in the Sb-genome. In contrast， the SiOBP12 has an Sb-specific duplication SiOBP12bâ， which was expressed in the SB/Sb worker antennae， while both paralogs SiOBP12 and SiOBP12bâ were expressed in the body. This result indicates that SiOBP12bâ has gained an antennal promoter or enhancer and suggests neofunctionalization， perhaps for queen discrimination behavior.,Extracted total mRNA of antennae of three worker types: monogyne SB/SB， polygyne SB/SB and polygyne SB/Sb. Four biorelicates were conducted (total 12 samples). Three of the four bioreplicates of the same genotype were mixed to make three RNA samples. These RNA samples were subjected to polyA-RNA selection and amplified with SMARTer Stranded RNA-seq kit. Amplified cDNA samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 150 paired-end protocol.,31788211,Ecol Evol

RNA-seq analysis of freshly isolated germinal center B cells,GSE128710,Mus musculus,Purpose: The goal of this study is to complare the transcitpional profiles of freshly isolated， splenic， murin GCBC and other activated and naive non-germinal center B cell populations.Methods: Cells were freshly isolated， bead purified and FACS Ari sorted . Sorted cells (1.5-3x106 cells per sample) were washed twice in cold PBS and RNA was prepared using shredder-columns (Qiagen; QIAshredder 79656) and the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturerâs instructions. 3 independent RNA libraries per cell population were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample preparation kit. The first step in the workflow involves purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads. Following purification， the mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Strand specificity is achieved by using dUTP in the Second Strand Marking Mix， followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. The products are then purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The cDNA libraries are validated using KAPA Biosystems primer premix kit with Illumina-compatible DNA primers and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. Quality is examined using Agilent Tapestation 2200.The cDNA libraries were pooled at a final concentration 1.8pM. Samples were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 with 75bp paired-end reads and aligned to the mm10 genome using the STAR aligner. The number of uniquely aligned reads ranged from 31 to 77 million. Using an optimized data analysis workflow， Gene-level counts were determined using featureCounts and raw counts were analyzed for differential expression using the âvoomâ method in the âlimmaâ R package.Results: After determining genes that were differentially expressed between splenic GCBC and activated B cells， we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

BubR1 allelic effects drive phenotypic heterogeneity in MVA progeria syndrome [10 month old RNA-seq],GSE134780,Mus musculus,Mosaic-variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome is a rare childhood disorder characterized by biallelic BUBR1， CEP57， or TRIP13 aberrations， increased chromosome missegregation， and a broad spectrum of clinical features， including various cancers， congenital defects， and progeroid pathologies. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this disorder and its phenotypic heterogeneity， we mimicked the BUBR1L1012P mutation in mice (BubR1L1002P) and combined it with two other MVA variants， BUBR1X753 and BUBR1H， generating a truncated protein and low amounts of wildtype protein， respectively. Whereas， BubR1X753/L1002P and BubR1H/X753 mice die prematurely， BubR1H/L1002P mice are viable and exhibit many MVA features， including cancer predisposition and various progeroid phenotypes， including short lifespan， dwarfism， lipodystrophy， sarcopenia， and low cardiac stress tolerance. Strikingly， although these mice had a similar reduction in total BubR1 and spectrum of MVA phenotypes as BubR1H/H mice， several progeroid pathologies were attenuated in severity， which in skeletal muscle coincided with reduced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) complexity. Additionally， mice harboring heterozygous BUBR1 MVA variants developed mild MVA pathologies later in life， with alleles conferring unique phenotypic profiles. Together， these data demonstrate that subtle BUBR1 allelic effects contribute to disease heterogeneity in both MVA patients and heterozygous carriers of MVA mutations， independent of aneuploidy rates and BUBR1 protein levels.,Skeletal muscle (skM， gastrocnemius) and fat (IAT) from 8-10-month-old wildtype and progeroid BubR1 MVA mutant mice (BubR1H/L1002P and BubR1H/H) were collected and harvested from naturally aged mice， euthanized at 8-10 months of age.

10x 3â scRNA-seq analysis on Jurkat cells post TCR acivation in CRISPR/Cas9 screening,GSE148820,Homo sapiens,By performing 10x 3â scRNA-seq on Jurkat cells post TCR acivation in CRISPR/Cas9 screening， we want to investigate the compatibility of the A/G mixed capture sequence on multiple single cell RNA-seq platforms. By mimicking the adenylated endogenous mRNA， gRNA transcripts could be directly captured by poly(dT) primer during the reverse transcription， and serve as perturbation index in high identification rate.,In this study， we provided a framework of direct âgenotypingâ for single cell CRISPR screen， by incorporating a capture sequence into the gRNA scaffold. With that， genotype， transcriptome and phenotype can be analyzed simultaneously. We used an A/G mixed capture sequence to mimic the poly(A) tail of pol II transcripts and facilitate the direct annealing of gRNA with poly(dT) RT primer that is widely used in versatile scRNA-seq platforms.,32513233,Genome Biol
A commensal Clostridium bacteria restricts alphavirus dissemination through a bile acid-type I IFN signaling axis,GSE150387,Mus musculus,The emerging alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people. However， the factors modulating disease outcome remain poorly understood. We show that depletion of the gut microbiota in oral antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice leads to greater CHIKV infection and spread within one day of virus inoculation. Perturbation of the gut microbiota alters TLR7-MyD88 signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and blunts systemic production of type I interferon (IFN). Consequently， circulating monocytes express fewer IFN-stimulated genes and become permissive for CHIKV infection. Reconstitution with a single commensal bacterial species， Clostridium scindens， or its derived metabolite， the bile acid deoxycholic acid， can restore pDC- and MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses to restrict systemic CHIKV infection and transmission back to vector mosquitoes. Thus， commensal gut bacteria modulate antiviral immunity and levels of circulating alphaviruses within hours of infection through a bile acid-pDC-IFN signaling axis， which affects virus dissemination and potentially， epidemic spread,Droplet-based 3â² end massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing was performed by isolating leukocytes of the peripheral blood following a magnetic bead-based CD4/CD8/CD19 depletion step. 3'GEX enrichment libraries were prepared using Chromium Single Cell 5â² Reagent Kits according to manufacturerâs protocol (10x Genomics).

Application of toxicogenomics for the risk assessment of the food contaminant acetamide,GSE132815,Rattus norvegicus,Acetamide (CAS 60-35-5) is detected in common foods including milk， eggs， beef， and roasted coffee beans. Chronic rodent bioassays using high doses (â¥1000 mg/kg/day) suggest acetamide is a group 2B possible human carcinogen due to the induction of liver tumors. Weight-of-evidence indicates acetamide is not genotoxic， and therefore a threshold response is expected. We used a toxicogenomics approach in Wistar rats gavaged daily for 7 and 28 days to determine the benchmark dose (BMD)， and investigate its mode of action from differential gene expression. Two exposure experiements were carried out in succsession.  An initial dose range finding experiment used male Wistar rats gavaged daily for 7 days at 0， 30， 100， 300 and 1000 mg/kd/day.  A second experiment used both male and female Wistar rats exposed for 7 and 28 days to 0， 300，500，750，1000 and 1500 mg/kg/day. No treatment related changes in terminal body weight， clinical chemistry， or histopathology were observed at doses of 30， 100， or 300 mkd. At 1000 mkd， the dose reported to elicit carcinogenesis， liver weights decreased 1.3-fold with the presence of single cell necrosis， hepatocyte vacuolization， and increased mitotic activity consistent with a 4.2 fold increase in the cell proliferation index. Accordingly， plasma ALT and AST were increased 2.0- and 2.2-fold， respectively. RNA-Seq analysis identified 1 differentially expressed gene at 300 mkd， and 2，685 at 1000 mkd (|fold-change| â¥ 1.5 and FDR â¤ 0.05). Down-regulated genes were associated with lipid metabolism while up-regulated genes included cell signaling， immune response， and cell cycle functions. Collectively， these results revealed a no-observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) and no-observed-transcriptional effect level (NOTEL) at 300 mkd， warranting further investigation at doses between 300 and 1000 mkd to identify the benchmark dose (BMD). Functional enrichment indicates perturbation of cell cycle and lipid metabolism， though a more refined dose-response evaluation will be needed to demonstrate dose-dependent effects related to the MOA of acetamide.

Functional heterogeneity within the developing zebrafish epicardium,GSE121750,Danio rerio,The epicardium is essential during cardiac development， homeostasis and repair and yet fundamental insights into its underlying cell biology， notably epicardium formation， lineage heterogeneity and functional cross-talk with other cell types in the heart， is currently lacking. In this study， we investigated epicardial heterogeneity and the functional diversity of discrete epicardial subpopulations in the developing zebrafish heart. Single-cell RNA-sequencing uncovered three epicardial subpopulations with specific genetic programmes and distinctive spatial distribution within the developing heart. Perturbation of unique gene signatures uncovered distinct functions associated with each subpopulation and established novel epicardial roles in cell adhesion， migration， and chemotaxis as a mechanism for recruitment of leukocytes into the heart. This work elucidates the mutual spatiotemporal relationships between different epicardial subpopulations and assigns unique function to each during cardiac development. Understanding which mechanisms cells employ to establish a functional epicardium and to communicate with other cardiovascular cell types during development will bring us closer to repairing cellular relationships that are disrupted during cardiovascular disease.,Single cell RNA sequencing of FACS purified larval cardiac zebrafish cells,32084358,Dev Cell

Dissecting the onset of random X-chromosome inactivation at high temporal and allelic resolution,GSE151009,Mus musculus,To ensure dosage compensation between the sexes， one randomly chosen X chromosome is silenced in each female cell in the process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). XCI is a model for cellular decision making and epigenetic gene regulation. The random cell-autonomous nature of XCI however has so far prevented its chromosome-wide investigation in its endogenous context without genetic perturbation. Here we use allele-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing to assess the onset of random XCI with high temporal resolution in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells， and develop dedicated analysis approaches. We find that XCI is initiated on both chromosomes in a subset of cells， but reverted to the final mono-allelic state once gene silencing is established. By exploiting the heterogeneity of XCI onset， we identify Nanog as its main trigger and discover additional genes that might control upregulation of Xist， the master regulator of XCI. Finally， we show that genetic variation between different mouse strains modulates the XCI process at multiple levels， and validate these findings through an orthogonal experimental approach. We thus draw a detailed picture of how XCI is initiated and the experimental and computational strategies we have developed here will now allow us to profile random XCI in more physiological contexts， including primary human cells in vivo.,Single cell RNA-Sequencing of a hybrid mESC mm10 line (C57BL6/J x Cast/EiJ) throughout differentiation (induced by 2i/Lif withdrawal) over time (day 0， 1， 2， 3， 4).

An activity-mediated transition in transcription in early postnatal neurons [BS-seq],GSE150534,Mus musculus,The maturation of the mammalian brain occurs after birth， and this stage of neuronal development is frequently impaired in neurological disorders， such as autism and schizophrenia. However， the mechanisms that regulate postnatal brain maturation are poorly defined. By purifying neuronal subpopulations across brain development in mice， we identify a postnatal switch in the transcriptional regulatory circuits that operates in the maturing mammalian brain. We show that this developmental transition includes the formation of hundreds of cell-type-specific neuronal enhancers in the postnatal period that might in part be modulated by neuronal activity. Once selected， these enhancers are active throughout adulthood， suggesting that their formation in early life shapes neuronal identity and regulates mature brain function.,BS-seq from mouse neurons,nan,
Single-nucleus RNA-seq and FISH reveal coordinated transcriptional activity in mammalian myofibers,GSE150065,Mus musculus,Skeletal muscle fibers are large syncytia but it is currently unknown whether gene expression is coordinately regulated in their numerous nuclei. By snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq， we showed that slow， fast， myotendinous and neuromuscular junction myonuclei each have different transcriptional programs， associated with distinct chromatin states and combinations of transcription factors. In adult mice， identified myofiber types predominantly express either a slow or one of the three fast isoforms of Myosin heavy chain (MYH) proteins， while a small number of hybrid fibers can express more than one MYH. By snRNA-seq and FISH， we showed that the majority of myonuclei within a myofiber are synchronized， coordinately expressing only one fast Myh isoform with a preferential pane of muscle-specific genes. Importantly， this coordination of expression occurs early during post-natal development and depends on innervation. These findings highlight a unique mechanism of coordination of gene expression in a syncytium.,Single nuclei RNA-seq and single nuclei ATAC-seq,33037211,Nat Commun
Somatic tissue engineering in mouse models reveals an actionable role for WNT pathway alterations in prostate cancer metastasis,GSE139340,Mus musculus,To study genetic factors that influence the progression and therapeutic response of advanced prostate cancer， we developed a fast and flexible system that introduces genetic alterations relevant to human disease directly into the prostate glands of mice using tissue electroporation. These electroporation based genetically engineered mouse models (EPO-GEMM) recapitulate features of traditional germline models and， by modeling genetic factors linked to late stage human disease， can produce tumors that are metastatic and castration resistant.  Unexpectedly， a subset of particularly metastatic tumors acquired WNT pathway alterations， which are also associated with metastatic prostate cancer in humans. Harnessing features linked to the EPO-GEMM approach， we validate the WNT pathway as a key event in driving metastatic disease， a finding that we confirm in an orthogonal approach using mouse prostate organoids. Moreover， we show that tumors harboring WNT pathway alterations are sensitive to pharmacological WNT pathway inhibition. Thus， by leveraging the power of EPO-GEMMs， our studies reveal a functional role for WNT signaling in driving prostate cancer metastasis and validate the WNT pathway as an actionable therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.,For RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptional profiles of MPten and MP EPO-GEMM prostate tumors， as well as normal anterior lobes of prostates of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6， total RNA was extracted from bulk tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).

A Single-Cell Atlas of the Multicellular Ecosystem of Primary and Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma,GSE149614,Homo sapiens,Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a paradigm of the relation between tumor microenvironment and tumor development. Here， we generated > 70，000 single-cell transcriptomes for 10 HCC patients from four relevant sites: primary tumor， portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT)， metastatic lymph node and non-tumor liver. We discovered a cluster of antitumor central memory T cells enriched in intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) of HCC. We found chronic HBV/HCV infection increases the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in tumors but aggravates the exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. We identified MMP9+ macrophages to be terminally differentiated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and two distinct differentiation trajectories are related to their accumulation. We further demonstrated MMP9+ TAMs can promote HCC cells migration， invasion and angiogenesis. Our data also revealed the heterogeneous population of malignant hepatocytes and found they might play multifaceted roles in shaping the immune microenvironment of HCC. Finally， we identified seven TME subtypes of HCC that can predict patient prognosis. Collectively， this large-scale， single-cell atlas deepens our understanding of the ecosystem in primary and metastatic HCCs， might facilitating identification of new immune therapy strategies for this malignancy.,Single-cell suspensions were converted to barcoded scRNA-seq libraries by using the Chromium Single Cell 3â Library， Gel Bead & Multiplex Kit and Chip Kit (10x Genomics)， aiming for an estimated 5，000 cells per library and following the manufacturerâs instructions.

For each patient， all samples (NTL， PT， PVTT and MLN) were processed in parallel in the same thermal cycler. The generated scRNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer. The Cell Ranger software (version 2.2.0) was used to perform sample demultiplexing， barcode processing and single-cell 3â counting. Cell Rangerâs mkfastq function was used to demultiplex raw base call files from the sequencer， into sample-specific fastq files. Afterward， fastq files for each sample were processed with Cell Rangerâs count function， which was used to align reads to human genome (build hg38) and quantify gene expression levels in single cells.Raw data access provided at: European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under accession EGAS00001004468.,35933472,Nat Commun
A complex regulatory landscape involved in the development of external genitals [ChIP-Seq],GSE138509,Mus musculus,In vertebrates， developmental genes are often controlled by large regulatory landscapes matching the dimensions of topologically associating domains (TADs). In various ontogenic contexts， the associated constitutive chromatin backbone is modified by fine-tuned specific variations in enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-promoter interaction profiles. In this work， we use a TAD flanking the HoxD gene cluster as a paradigm to address the question of how these complex regulatory architectures are formed and how they are de-constructed once their function has been achieved. We suggest that this TAD can be considered as a coherent functional unit in itself， with several regulatory sequences acting together to elicit a transcriptional response. With one notable exception， the deletion of each of these sequences in isolation did not produce any substantial modification in the global transcriptional outcome of the system， a result at odds with a conventional view of long-range enhancer function. Likewise， both the deletion and inversion of a CTCF site located in a region rich in such sequences did not affect transcription of the target gene. In the latter case， however， slight modifications were observed in interaction profiles in vivo in agreement with the loop extrusion model， despite no apparent functional consequences. We discuss these unexpected results by considering both conventional explanations and an alternative possibility whereby a rather unspecific accumulation of particular factors within the TAD backbone may have a global impact upon transcription.,ChIP-seq analysis of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 in the genital tubercle (GT) or the cloaca region (CR) of wildtype mouse embryos.

Gene architecture and sequence composition underpin selective dependency of long RNAs on components of the nuclear export pathway,GSE139151,Homo sapiens,The nuclear export pathway transports long RNAs produced in the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The core components of this pathway are thought to be required for export of virtually all polyadenylated RNAs. Here， we depleted different proteins that act in nuclear export in human cells， and quantified the transcriptome-wide consequences on RNA localization. Different genes exhibited substantially variable sensitivities， with depletion of NXF1 and TREX components causing some transcripts to become strongly retained in the nucleus while others were not affected. Specifically， NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U-content， whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts. Using massively parallel reporter assays we identified short sequence elements that render transcripts dependent on NXF1 for their export， and identified synergistic effects of splicing and NXF1. These results revise the current model of how nuclear export shapes the distribution of RNA within human cells.,In order to obtain further evidence that the observed effects are a direct consequence of NXF1 depletion， we used SLAM-seq (Herzog et al. 2017)， which included labeling of newly synthesized RNA using 4-thiouridine followed by iodoacetamide treatment of extracted RNA and sequencing. We labeled RNA for 4 hours just 16 hours after transfection of siRNAs targeting NXF1， which was sufficient for partial depletion of the NXF1 protein. In order to identify sequences that may promote NXF1-dependent export of intronless RNAs， we used a massively parallel RNA assay (Lubelsky and Ulitsky 2018; Shukla et al. 2018). We designed short oligos tiled across the sequences of NORAD， ATXN7L3B， MEX3C， and eight additional single-exon， cytoplasmic， and NXF1-sensitive human genes， including six PCGs and two lncRNAs. As a control， we also included the JPX lncRNA and a fragment of the MLXIPL gene， which we studied previously (Lubelsky and Ulitsky 2018). Most of the transcripts were tiled with 140 nt sequences with offsets of 20 nt (10 nt for NORAD and 25 nt for JPX). Overall， 2，545 sequences (collectively called CytoLib) were cloned into the 3'UTR of an intronless variant of the ?-globin gene (??1，2)， which is relatively inefficiently exported， and was previously used as a model sequence for study of elements affecting nuclear export (Akef， Lee， and Palazzo 2015; Brown and Steitz 2016). In order to test the potential importance of RBM15 binding and m6A in nuclear export， we knocked down RBM15 alongside its paralog RBM15B， and WTAP， a core member of the m6A writer complex， and examined localization of CytoLib tiles.,32504555,Mol Cell

Genome-wide off-rates reveal how DNA binding dynamics shape transcription factor function [ChIP-Seq],GSE151692,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Protein-DNA interactions are dynamic and these dynamics are an important aspect of chromatin-associated processes such as transcription or replication. Due to a lack of methods to study on- and off-rates across entire genomes， protein-DNA interaction dynamics have not been studied extensively. Here we determine in vivo off-rates for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromatin organizing factor Abf1， at 191 sites simultaneously across the yeast genome. Average Abf1 residence times span a wide-range， varying between 4.5 and 37 minutes. Sites with different off-rates are associated with different functional characteristics. This includes their transcriptional dependency on Abf1， nucleosome positioning and the size of the nucleosome-free region， as well as the ability to roadblock RNA polymerase II for termination. The results show how off-rates contribute to transcription factor function and that DIVORSEQ (Determining In Vivo Off-Rates by SEQuencing) is a meaningful way of investigating protein-DNA binding dynamics genome-wide.,Abf1 binding was measured using ChIP-seq before (0 min) and at 10 time points (5， 10， 15， 20， 30， 40， 50， 60， 75， 90 min) during depletion from the nucleus using anchor-away， in triplicate.

CTCF mediates chromatin looping via N-terminal domain-dependent cohesin retention [ChIP-seq & RNA-seq],GSE137216,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The DNA-binding protein CTCF and the cohesin complex function together to shape chromatin architecture in mammalian cells， but the molecular details of this process remain unclear. We demonstrate that a 79 amino acid region within the CTCF N-terminal domain but not the C-terminus is necessary for cohesin positioning at CTCF binding sites and chromatin loop formation. However， the N-terminus of CTCF， when fused to artificial zinc fingers that do not bind to CTCF DNA binding sites was not sufficient to redirect cohesin to different genomic locations， indicating that cohesin positioning by CTCF does not involve direct protein-protein interactions with cohesin subunits. BORIS (CTCFL)， a germlinespecific paralog of CTCF was unable to anchor cohesin to CTCF DNA binding sites. Furthermore， CTCF-BORIS Chimeric constructs provided evidence that both the first two CTCF zinc fingers and， likely， the 3D geometry of CTCF-DNA complexes are involved in cohesin retention. Moreover， we were able to convert BORIS into CTCF with respect to cohesin positioning， thus providing additional molecular details of the cohesin retention function of CTCF. Our data suggest that the N-terminus of CTCF and the 3D spatial conformation of the CTCF-DNA complex act as a roadblock to constrain cohesin movement along DNA.,Genome-wide mapping of CTCF， RAD21， BORIS and Chimeric proteins occupancy in wild type and mutant CH12 cells.Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) of wild type and mutant CH12 cells.,31937660,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

Expression of RUNX1-ETO Rapidly Alters the Chromatin Landscape and Growth of Early Human Myeloid Precursor Cells (ATAC-Seq),GSE137667,Homo sapiens,Acute myeloid leukemia is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by recurrent mutations in genes encoding transcriptional， epigenetic and/or signaling regulators. The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO， whose expression can be detected in utero but is insufficient to cause overt disease. Although patients harboring cells with the t(8;21) translocation have acquired additional mutations and show extensive epigenetic reprogramming， the effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this question， we used a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive human myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding， blocks differentiation and arrests cellular growth， whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal.

Combinatorial single-cell CRISPR screens by direct guide RNA capture and targeted sequencing,GSE146194,Homo sapiens,Single-cell CRISPR screens allow for the exploration of mammalian gene function and genetic regulatory networks， but their utility has been limited in part by their reliance on indirect sgRNA indexing. Here， we present direct capture Perturb-seq， a versatile screening approach in which expressed sgRNAs are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct capture Perturb-seq enables the detection of multiple distinct sgRNAs expressed from a single vector within individual cells and thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial perturbation libraries. We demonstrate that this approach allows high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions， and we leverage this ability to dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol biogenesis and DNA repair. We also show that targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves the efficacy of CRISPR interference and activation， facilitating the use of compact， highly active CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Lastly， we show that hybridization-based target enrichment permits sensitive， specific sequencing of informative transcripts from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.,Single-cell， pooled CRISPR screening experiments comparing the transcriptional effects of knockdown or overexpression of genes. This repository includes five discrete experiments. (1) CRISPRi knockdown of genes known to induce the UPR across 5 different Perturb-seq platforms to compare data quality. (2) Paired CRISPRi knockdown of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and DNA repair， to assess the utility of direct capture Perturb-seq for epistasis analysis. (3) CRISPRi knockdown of genes with either a single sgRNA or two sgRNAs， to assess compact library design.

Cross-species analysis of melanoma enhancer logic using deep learning,GSE142238,Danio rerio;Homo sapiens;Canis lupus familiaris;Equus caballus;Sus scrofa domesticus;Mus musculus,Here， we combine comparative regulatory genomics with machine learning to investigate enhancer logic in melanoma. Through epigenomics profiling of 26 melanoma cell lines across six species， we examine the conservation of the two main melanoma states and underlying master regulators. By training a deep neural network on topic models derived from the human lines， we were able to classify not only human melanoma enhancers， but also regulatory regions in the other species. The deep learning model revealed important genomic features (i.e. TF binding motifs) for the different melanoma states， how they co-occur within melanoma enhancers， and where they are placed with respect to the central enhancer nucleosome. This in-depth analysis of the melanoma enhancer code allowed us to propose a mechanistic model of TF binding in MEL melanoma enhancers. Finally， by exploiting the deep layers of our model， we are able to identify causal mutations for melanoma enhancer loss and gain through evolution， not only affecting enhancer accessibility but also activity.,(omni)ATAC-seq on melanoma cell lines across six species， as well as OmniATAC-seq on knock-down of transcription factors in the human melanoma cell line MM001,32732264,Genome Res
Clonal multi-omics reveals Bcor as a regulator of dendritic cell development and its action at a clonal level,GSE153675,Mus musculus,Despite major developments in single cell multi-omics approaches， a single stem or progenitor cell can only be tested once. Here we develop âclonal multi-omicsâ， where recent daughters of a clone act as surrogates of the parental cell allowing multiple tests of its molecular profile and/or cellular fate under different conditions. We first present SIS-seq â a novel clonal method whereby siblings are examined in parallel for gene expression by RNA-seq， or for fate after culture. We use this method to identify， then validate using CRISPR， the genes expressed in single haematopoietic progenitors that control the development of the different dendritic cell (DC) subtypes. In this way， Bcor is identified as a suppressor of plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC subtype 2 (cDC2) numbers during Flt3 ligand-mediated âemergencyâ DC development. Using a complementary method SIS-skew â where WT and BcorKO siblings of the same clone are examined in parallel for fate â we discover that Bcor restricts clonal expansion， especially for generation of cDC2s， and suppresses clonal fate potential， especially for pDCs. SIS-seq and SIS-skew therefore represent novel and broadly applicable clonal multi-omics approaches that could reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing stem， immune， reprogrammed and cancer cell function at a single cell level， including after genetic or extrinsic factor perturbation.,Mouse HSPCs were isolated from bone marrow and sorted into 384 PCR plate， with library generated using the CEL-seq2 protocol.,nan,
Multiplexed single-cell autism modeling reveals convergent mechanisms altering neuronal differentiation,GSE142078,Homo sapiens,We coupled dCas9-based transcriptional repression of autism and neurodevelopmental disease genes to single-cell RNA-sequencing in the context of human neuron differentiation to identify the unique and shared consequences of these perturbations in a pooled experimental format.,We infected LUHMES cells with a library of sgRNAs targeting 14 ASD-relevant genes or non-targeting guides (47 unique guideRNAs total)， selected cells at a low MOI to enrich for cells with only 1 perturbation， and then differentiated these cells for 8 days. After 8 days， we performed single cell RNA-sequencing using the 10X Chromium platform to identify the effects of ASD-gene knockdown on neuron differentiation. We used the CROP-seq method to recover the sgRNA sequences from polyA RNA.,32887689,Genome Res
Identification of a novel set of DNA methylation markers in bladder cancer using MBD-methylCap/seq and urine DNA screening in a Chinese population,GSE33839,Homo sapiens,The aim of the present study was to identify novel DNA methylation markers in bladder cancer (BCa) through genome-wide profiling of bladder cancer cell lines and subsequent MSP screening in urine samples. Experimental Design: MBD methylCap/seq was carried out to screen differentially methylated CpG islands using two BCa cell lines (5637 and T24) and two normal bladder mucosa (BM) samples. The top one hundred most hypermethylated targets were screened using Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) in small and big cohort of urine samples from BCa patients and normal controls. The diagnostic performance of the gene panel was further evaluated in different clinical scenarios. Results: In total， 1，627 gene promoter regions hypermethylated in BCa cell line were identified in genomic level methylation profiling. The followed screening procedure in clinical urine sample generated eight genes (VAX1， KCNV1， ECEL1， TMEM26， TAL1， PROX1， SLC6A20， and LMX1A) capable of differentiating BCa from normal control. Subsequent validation in a large sample size enabled the optimisation of 5 methylation targets (VAX1， KCNV1， TAL1， PPOX1 and CFTR) for BCa diagnosis with sensitivity and specificity of 86.32% and 87.13%， respectively. In addition， VAX1 and LMX1A methylation could predict the tumour recurrence. Conclusions: Tumor specific biomarkers of BCa could be established by first performing genome level methylation profiling with cell lines and then screening the potential targets in urine samples. The panel of methylated genes identified was promising for the early non-invasive detection and surveillance of BCa.,MBD methylCap/seq was carried out to screen differentially methylated CpG islands using two BCa cell lines (5637 and T24)， and two normal bladder tissue mix as control.,22529986,PLoS One
Genome-wide CRISPRi/a screens in human neurons link lipid imbalance to ferroptosis,GSE152988,Homo sapiens,Neurons are unique among all human cell types in their high energy demand， long lifespans and rich lipid contents. As such， neurons exhibit unique vulnerability to oxidative stress caused by redox imbalance in aging and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). To systematically identify regulators of neuronal survival under oxidative stress and regulators of neuronal redox homeostasis， we conducted multiple survival- and FACS-based genome-wide screens in human iPSC-derived neurons， using our functional genomics toolkit including a previously established CRISPRi approach and a newly developed CRISPRa approach. So far， these are the first genome-wide screens in human neurons. Our results revealed that inhibiting glycosphingolipids (GSLs) degradation by depletion of prosaposin (PSAP) drives the formation of lipofuscins in neurons which leads to iron accumulation and strongly induces ROS production that oxidizing lipids and leads to neuronal ferroptosis under oxidative stress. We also conducted single cell CROP-seq screens that revealed transcriptomic signatures of NDD-associated genes. These datasets are freely available through our open-access database CRISPRbrain.,For the CROP-seq experiments， we included 184 genes for CRISPRi and 100 genes for CRISPRa， which were hits in at least one of our genome-wide pooled screens and were also associated with human neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). We curated a list of NDD-associated genes based on the literature and the DisGeNET database (https://www.disgenet.org/). The CROP-seq libraries included 2 sgRNAs per gene plus 6 non-targeting control sgRNAs， for a total of 374 sgRNAs for CRISPRi and 206 sgRNAs for CRISPRa. Top and bottom strands of sgRNA oligos were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) and annealed in an arrayed format. The annealed sgRNAs were then pooled in equal amounts and ligated into our optimized CROP-seq vector (Gilbert et al.， 2014).The CROP-seq experiments were carried out similarly as previously described (Tian et al.， 2019). Briefly， Day 0 CRISPRi and CRISPRa neurons were infected by the corresponding CROP-seq sgRNA library at a MOI of 0.1-0.2， followed by puromycin selection at 4 Âµg/ml for 3 days and recovery. On Day 10， neurons were dissociated with Papain and approximately 98，000 CRISPRi neurons and 50，000 CRISPRa neurons were loaded into 10X chips with about 25，000 input cells per lane. Sample preparations were performed using the ChromiumNext GEM Single Cell 3Ê¹ Reagent Kits v3.1 (10X Genomics; Cat. No.PN-1000121) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. To facilitate sgRNA assignment， sgRNA-containing transcripts were additionally amplified by hemi-nested PCR reactions as described (Tian et al.， 2019). The sgRNA-enrichment libraries were separately indexed and sequenced as spike-ins alongside the whole- transcriptome scRNA-seq libraries using a NovaSeq 6000 using the following configuration: Read 1: 28， i7 index: 8， i5 index: 0， Read 2: 91.  3â²-tag RNA-seq was performed to obtain gene expression profiles of WT and PSAP KO neurons cultured in the medium lack of antioxidants. Each genotype has 3 replicates. Raw sequencing reads from 3â²-tag RNA-seq were mapped to the human reference transcriptome (GRCh38， Ensembl Release 97) using Salmon (v.0.14.139) with the âânoLengthCorrectionâ option to obtain transcript abundance counts. Gene-level count estimates were obtained using tximport (v.1.8.040) with default settings. Subsequently， genes with more than 10 counts were retained for differential gene-expression analysis， and adjusted P values (Padj) were calculated using DESeq2 (v.1.20.041).,34031600,Nat Neurosci

Expression of RUNX1-ETO Rapidly Alters the Chromatin Landscape and Growth of Early Human Myeloid Precursor Cells (RNA-Seq),GSE137671,Homo sapiens,Acute myeloid leukemia is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by recurrent mutations in genes encoding transcriptional， epigenetic and/or signaling regulators. The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO， whose expression can be detected in utero but is insufficient to cause overt disease. Although patients harboring cells with the t(8;21) translocation have acquired additional mutations and show extensive epigenetic reprogramming， the effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this question， we used a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive human myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding， blocks differentiation and arrests cellular growth， whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal.

Proteomics and ribosome profiling informed revisions of protein-coding genes， which included 44 start codon changes and 42 added proteins.

High-throughput single-cell mitochondrial DNA genotyping reveals properties of clonal variation in human contexts [CD34-invitro],GSE142742,Homo sapiens,Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation plays a fundamental role in human disease and enables the clonal tracing of native human cells. While various genotyping approaches revealed mutational heterogeneity in human tissues and single cells， current methodologies are limited by scale. Here， we introduce a high-throughput， droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells. Further， the concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin readout enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy， clonal lineage， cell state， and accessible chromatin regulatory features. Our multi-omic analyses reveals single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A>G)， which we tie to intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Further， using somatic mtDNA mutations， we clonally trace thousands of hematopoietic cells in vitro and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia， linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution in vivo.Â,~500 or 800 CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were clonally expanded in two independent cultures before differentiating cells in the presence of erythropoietin， stem cell factor and interleukin-3.,nan,
Evidence for additive and synergistic action of mammalian enhancers during cell fate determination,GSE131620,Homo sapiens,Enhancer activity is known to drive cell differentiation and cell type determination， but it remains unclear how enhancers cooperate during these processes. Here we investigate enhancer cooperation during transdifferentiation of human B-cells to macrophages using enhancer RNA synthesis from accessible， H3K4-monomethylated chromatin regions as a proxy for enhancer activity. Most enhancers cooperate in an additive way to induce transcription of target genes. However， at ~130 loci， enhancers cooperate synergistically， changing activity of target genes exponentially over time. The latter genes are cell type-specific， indicating that enhancer synergy can drive differentiation and cell type determination. Pioneering factor occupancy， DNA accessibility profiling and eRNA synthesis reveal the temporal order of events that lead to enhancer synergy. Our results are consistent with a condensation model for transcription activation of cell type-specific genes that involves simultaneous contacts of multiple enhancers with their target promoter.,Refer to individual Series,33770473,Elife

Mechanisms of terminal erythroid differentiation defect in EKLF-deficient mice,GSE36618,Mus musculus,EKLF is a KrÃ¼ppel-like transcription factor identified as a transcriptional activator and chromatin modifier in erythroid cells. EKLF-deficient (Eklf -/-) mice die at day 14.5 of gestation from severe anemia. In this study， we demonstrate that early progenitor cells fail to undergo terminal erythroid differention in Eklf -/- embryos. To discover potential EKLF target genes responsible for the failure of erythropoiesis， transcriptional profiling was performed with RNA from wild type and Eklf -/- early erythroid progenitor cells. These analyses identified significant perturbation of a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation， with the critical regulator of the cell cycle， E2f2， at a hub. E2f2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased in Eklf -/- early erythroid progenitor cells， which showed a delay in the G1-to-S-phase transition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated EKLF occupancy at the proximal E2f2 promoter in vivo. Consistent with the role of EKLF as a chromatin modifier， EKLF binding-sites in the E2f2 promoter were located in a region of EKLF-dependent DNase I sensitivity in early erythroid progenitor cells. We propose a model in which EKLF-dependent activation and modification of the E2f2 locus is required for cell cycle progression preceding terminal erythroid differentiation.,RNA was isolated from flow-sorted early erythroid progenitors in 13.5 day old fetal livers from EKLF knock out mice (n=3 fetal livers) and wild-type control mice (n=3 fetal livers) for gene expression analysis,18852285,Mol Cell Biol

Transcriptomic profiling study of canine degenerative mitral valve disease,GSE64544,Canis lupus familiaris,Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. Some signaling pathways have been implicated in DMVD， including the serotonin and TGF-beta pathways. We sought to identify additional molecular and metabolic pathways that contribute to DMVD using transcriptomic and metabolomic studies. RNA-seq gene expression evaluated on total RNA isolated from left ventricle (LV) and mitral valve (MV) identified 812 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in LV and 263 DETs in MV. Out of 15 transcripts selected for RT-qPCR validation， we confirmed 13. In addition， serum samples were collected for metabolomic evaluation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly up-regulated in both LV and MV while the level of circulating asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA)， an endogenous NOS inhibitor， was lower in DMVD. Expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their endogenous inhibitor tissue inhibitor of matrix metallopeptidases (TIMP) were altered. This study demonstrates transcript and metabolite differences consistent with increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production， impaired fatty acid transport and oxidation， and increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in DMVD. Our findings are consistent with metabolic conversion in the DMVD heart from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis along with an increased concentration of NO and ROS activity suggesting an alternative signaling effect.

Paracrine Ras/ERK signalling drives gene expression plasticity in a model of basal-like breast cancer,GSE118312,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The EGFR/Ras/ERK signalling pathway is a primary driver of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in tumours that exhibit high cell-to-cell heterogeneity. While the signalling activity of this pathway is frequently amplified in tumours， it is not understood how the kinetic aspects of its activation in tumours differ from normal cellular signalling. We explored these single-cell kinetic differences using live-cell reporters of ERK signalling in the breast cancer progression series HMT-3522 and found that ERK activity in invasive cells is similar in amplitude to non-malignant cells but is highly dynamic and more disordered， leading to more heterogeneous expression of ERK target genes. We traced this variability to a high degree of amphiregulin-mediated autocrine signalling by invasive cells. Dynamic ERK activity could be transferred from invasive to pre-malignant cells through paracrine signalling in co-culture， and could drive temporal variation in the expression of genes including Fra-1， c-Myc， and Egr1 at the single-cell level. Our findings establish a mechanism for the generation of tumour cell plasticity， in which paracrine signalling in the microenvironment is translated into continually shifting diversity in gene expression profiles， helping drive the phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells.,Drop-seq analysis of HMT-3522 cell culture lines S1， T4 (10，212 cells， 5 samples total including 1 species mixing experiment),nan,
Synthetic immunomodulation with a CRISPR super-repressor in vivo,GSE152412,Mus musculus,In this study we introduce an enhanced CRISPR-based transcriptional repressor to reprogram immune homeostasis in vivo. By a dual fusion of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) and KrÃ¼ppel associated box (KRAB) to MS2 coat protein and recruitment to a nuclease competent CRISPR complex， we demonstrate transcriptional repression of the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88) gene in vivo. We report that this strategy can effectively modulate host immune response against adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy and influence the course of septicemia.,For the in vitro RNA seq data， Neuro 2A cells received CRISPR components with full length or truncated gRNAs targeting endogenous Myd88 locus. The goal of the experiment was comparing specificity of the gRNAs. Repression levels were assessed 3 days post transfection using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR.For the in vivo RNA seq data， Cas9 nuclease transgenic mice received AAV1-Myd88-Ms2-HP1aKRAB or AAV1-Myd88-MS2-KRAB through retro-orbital injection. 3 weeks post injection， Myd88 expression levels were assessed in bone marrow by qRT-PCR analysis.,nan,

Comprehensive comparative analysis of strand-specific RNA sequencing methods,GSE21739,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Strand-specific massively-parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for novel transcript discovery， genome annotation， and expression profiling.  Despite multiple published methods for strand-specific RNA-Seq， no consensus exists as to how to choose between them.  Here， we developed a comprehensive computational pipeline for the comparison of library quality metrics from any RNA-Seq method.  Using the well-annotated Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome as a benchmark， we compared seven library construction protocols， including both published and our own novel methods.  We found marked differences in complexity， strand-specificity， evenness and continuity of coverage， agreement with known annotations， and accuracy for expression profiling. Weighing each methodâs performance and ease， we identify the dUTP second strand marking and the Illumina RNA ligation methods as the leading protocols， with the former benefitting from the availability of paired-end sequencing.  Our analysis provides a comprehensive benchmark， and our computational pipeline is applicable for assessment of future protocols in any organism.,Examination of 11 different strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 7 distinct methods; also 2 control non-strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries. To assess the performance of each strand-specific library in digital expression profiling， we compared them to reference expression measurements estimated from expression profiles using competitive hybridization of a mid-log RNA sample vs. genomic DNA using Agilent arrays.,20711195,Nat Methods
Optimized design of antisense oligomers for targeted rRNA depletion,GSE152902,Danio rerio;Xenopus laevis,RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a standard method for quantifying gene expression transcriptome-wide. Due to the extremely high proportion of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in total RNA， sequencing libraries usually incorporate messenger RNA (mRNA) enrichment. Although polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail selection is widely used， many applications require alternate approaches such as rRNA depletion. Recently， selective rRNA digestion， using RNaseH and antisense DNA oligomers that tile the length of target RNAs， has emerged as an easy， cost-effective alternative to commercial rRNA depletion kits. Here， we present a streamlined RNaseH-mediated rRNA depletion method that uses shorter antisense oligos that only sparsely tile the target RNA， in a digestion reaction of only 5 minutes. We wrote a Web tool， Oligo-ASST， that simplifies oligo design to favor target regions with optimal thermodynamic properties， and additionally allows users to design common oligo pools that can simultaneously target divergent RNAs in their regions of higher sequence similarity. We demonstrate the efficacy of these oligos by building rRNA-depleted sequencing libraries for Xenopus laevis as well as zebrafish， which expresses two distinct versions of the 28S， 18S， 5.8S， and 5S rRNAs during embryogenesis. These libraries efficiently deplete rRNA to <5% of total reads， on par with poly(A) selection， and also reveal expression of many non-adenylated RNA species.

Î²-catenin safeguards the ground state of pluripotency by strengthening the robustness of the transcriptional apparatus [ATAC-seq],GSE123690,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured with inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 (2iL) more closely resemble the pre-implantation embryo inner cell mass than cultures in serum/LIF (SL). Unveiling the differences between both systems is important for understanding development and could also assist in isolating an ESC equivalent for other mammalian species. In SL， pluripotency and cell cycle gene transcription is a multistep process requiring release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol2) by the histone acetylation reader BRD4 and the Pol2 kinase CDK9. Here， we show that recruitment of co-regulators including Mediator and Cohesin by Î²-catenin changes the mode of transcriptional regulation at BRD4/CDK9-bound loci in 2iL. This switch renders pluripotency genes more reliant on transcriptional initiation and less on Pol2 pause release for effective gene body elongation.  Conversely， cell cycle genes are not bound by Î²-catenin and are still dependent on Pol2 pause release. Thus， pluripotency is more resistant to BRD4/CDK9 suppression in 2iL while self-renewal remains highly sensitive. Our findings help to explain how pluripotency is shielded in the ground state and provide insight into transcriptional adaptation upon network perturbation in other contexts.,ATAC-seq of mouse ESCs cultured in different conditions.,32832621,Sci Adv
Histone Variant H2A.X Plays Novel Roles in Cell Lineage Commitment and Genomic Stability in ESC and iPSC,GSE49147,Mus musculus,"Herein， we demonstrated that the cell lineage commitment is unexpectedly regulated by the novel functions of H2A.X， a histone variant which was only well-known for its role in genome integrity maintenance previously. Surprisingly， only in ESCs but not differentiated cells， H2A.X is specifically targeted to genomic regions encoding early embryonic and extra-embryonic lineage genes to repress their expression. In addition， H2A.X is also enriched at genomic regions sensitive to replication stress and maintains genomic stability thereat. Most interestingly， faithful H2A.X deposition plays critical roles in maintaining both cell lineage commitment and genome integrity in iPSC. In iPSC lines which support the development of ""all-iPS"" animals， H2A.X deposition faithfully recapitulates the ESC pattern and therefore， the genome stability and cell lineage commitment are maintained. In iPSC lines that fail to support embryonic development， defective H2A.X depositions result in aberrant upregulation of early embryonic and extra-embryonic lineage genes and H2A.X-dependent genome instability.",mRNA-Seq of WT ESC and H2A.X KO ESC; and 4N+， 4N- iPSC.,25192463,Cell Stem Cell
Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901， a shift from a H2-excess and P-limiting condition to a H2-limited and P-excess condition in chemostats (growth rate held constant),GSE42130,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. For shifts from P-limited to P-excess conditions， phosphate was raised from 0.12 mM to the standard 0.8 mM. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
BrphyB is critical for rapid recovery to darkness in mature Brassica rapa leaves,GSE135955,Brassica rapa,Here， we examine the transcriptomic response of adult wild-type and BrphyB leaves to darkening and recovery in light. Three days of dark was sufficient to elicit a response in wild type leaves suggesting a shift from carbon fixation and nutrient acquisition to active redistribution of cellular resources. Upon a return to light， wild-type leaves appeared to transcriptionally return to a pre-darkness state restoring a focus on nutrient acquisition. BrphyB mutant plants have a similar response with key differences in genes involved in photosynthesis and light response which deviate from the wild type transcriptional dynamics. Genes targeted to the chloroplast are especially affected. Adult plants had fewer， larger chloroplasts suggesting a link between phytochromes， chloroplast development， photosynthetic deficiencies and resource allocation.,Two developmentally matched leaves from each wild-type and BrphyB-3 plant were tagged that corresponded to the first and second true leaves. Samples were collected at 5 ZT using a standard whole punch (28 mm2 of leaf tissue) with symmetrical harvest for chlorophyll assay， chloroplast measurements and transcriptome analysis. Tissue from 3 plants was combined to make one biological replicate. At 3 weeks of age the âPreâ sample was collected from the first leaf while the second one was covered with tinfoil. 24 hours later the â24hrâ sample were harvested from the uncovered leaf， the same leaf that provided the âPreâ sample. Then， 48 hours later the tinfoil was removed from the covered leaf and the âdarkâ samples were similarly collected. Finally， 24 hours later the ârecoveryâ samples were collected from this same leaf. RNA-seq data from 4 biological replicates of wild-type (WT_3 to WT_6)， and 3 of BrphyB-3 (phyB_3 to phyB_5) plants were used in this study.,nan,

High throughput joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and protein levels in single cells [Species mix],GSE156475,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Recent technological advances have enabled massively parallel single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (scATAC-seq) to simultaneously profile the epigenomic landscape in thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq methods sample genomic DNA accessible to transposases， but have not previously been combined with measurement of protein levels.  Here， we present ATAC with Select Antigen Profiling by sequencing， ASAP-seq， a tool to simultaneously profile accessible chromatin and protein levels in thousands of single cells， pairing sparse scATAC data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers， and optionally， enriched mtDNA coverage for lineage tracing (mtscATAC-seq) with minimal impact on ATAC-seq data quality.

Runx-mediated gene regulation during thymic T cell development and stage specific genomic interactions of Runx3,GSE154304,Mus musculus,Runx transcription factors play pivotal roles in the development of hematopoietic cells， including T cells.  However， the Runx-target genes in early stages of thymic T cell development have been only partially elucidated.  Moreover， the relationships of different Runx paralogs， whether they compete or collaborate with each other， are unknown.We have performed CRISPR-Cas9 mediated acute deletion of Runx1 and Runx3， alone and in combination， to define the functions of Runx factors and their target genes.  We focused on two distinct stages of early T cell development; before lineage commitment (Phase1) and after commitment (Phase2).  Our data suggest that Runx1 and Runx3 are functionally redundant in Phase1， hence the absence of one factor was compensated by the other factor.  In Phase2， Runx1 becomes a major contributor， while low levels of Runx3 still strengthened the Runx1-mediated target gene regulation and showed an additive effect.Of importance， we found that Runx1 and Runx3 upregulate T cell programs and inhibit alternative lineage genes.  In order to capture the developmental status of Runx-perturbed cells， we performed supervised principal component analysis (PCA) using a fixed frame of PC loadings from single cell RNA-seq analysis of normal in vivo-derived thymocytes.  Unlike the reference in vitro and in vivo pro-T cell population or sgControl introduced cells， Runx knockout cells either failed to progress fully (Phase1) or deflected from the normal developmental trajectory (Phase2)， suggesting essential roles of Runx factors in early stages of T development.In addition， we analyzed the correlation between stage-specific genomic occupancy of Runx1 and Runx3 (using previously published data for Runx1， GSE103953) and Runx-mediated gene regulation responses at each stage.  Interestingly， genes with dynamic， stage-sensitive expression showed a very significant association with phase-specific genomic interactions of Runx factors， and an especially strong correlation with Runx activated target genes.In summary， our data suggest a pivotal role for Runx transcription factors in thymic T cell development by imposing T lineage specification in Phase1 and instructing the lineage-committed progenitor cells to progress through a normal T developmental trajectory.,ChIP-seq:Bone-marrow progenitor cells from C57BL/6J wild-type animals were cultured on OP9-DLL1 stromal cells with IL-7 and Flt3-ligand to promote T-lineage development.

A complex regulatory landscape involved in the development of external genitals [ATAC-Seq],GSE138513,Mus musculus,In vertebrates， developmental genes are often controlled by large regulatory landscapes matching the dimensions of topologically associating domains (TADs). In various ontogenic contexts， the associated constitutive chromatin backbone is modified by fine-tuned specific variations in enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-promoter interaction profiles. In this work， we use a TAD flanking the HoxD gene cluster as a paradigm to address the question of how these complex regulatory architectures are formed and how they are de-constructed once their function has been achieved. We suggest that this TAD can be considered as a coherent functional unit in itself， with several regulatory sequences acting together to elicit a transcriptional response. With one notable exception， the deletion of each of these sequences in isolation did not produce any substantial modification in the global transcriptional outcome of the system， a result at odds with a conventional view of long-range enhancer function. Likewise， both the deletion and inversion of a CTCF site located in a region rich in such sequences did not affect transcription of the target gene. In the latter case， however， slight modifications were observed in interaction profiles in vivo in agreement with the loop extrusion model， despite no apparent functional consequences. We discuss these unexpected results by considering both conventional explanations and an alternative possibility whereby a rather unspecific accumulation of particular factors within the TAD backbone may have a global impact upon transcription.,ATAC-seq analysis of the cloaca region of wildtype mouse embryos or the genital tubercle of wildtype or mutant mouse embryos,32301703,Elife

Genetic deletion of microRNA biogenesis in muscle cells reveals a hierarchical non- clustered network that controls focal adhesion signaling during muscle regeneration,GSE154254,Homo sapiens,Objective: Decreased muscle mass is a major contributor to age-related morbidity， and strategies to improve muscle regeneration during ageing are urgently needed. Our aim was to identify the subset of relevant microRNAs (miRNAs) that partake in critical aspects of muscle cell differentiation， irrespective of computational predictions， genomic clustering or differential expression of the miRNAs.  Methods: miRNA biogenesis was deleted in primary myoblasts using a tamoxifen-inducible CreLox system and combined with an add-back miRNA library screen. RNA-seq experiments， cellular signalling events， and glycogen synthesis， along with miRNA inhibitors， were performed in human primary myoblasts. Muscle regeneration in young and aged mice was assessed using the cardiotoxin (CTX) model.   Results: We identified a hierarchical non-clustered miRNA network consisting of highly (miR-29a)， moderately (let-7) and mildly active (miR-125b， miR-199a， miR-221) miRNAs that cooperate by directly targeting members of the focal adhesion complex. Through RNA-seq experiments comparing single versus combinatorial inhibition of the miRNAs， we uncovered a fundamental feature of this network， that miRNA activity inversely correlates to miRNA cooperativity. During myoblast differentiation， combinatorial inhibition of the five miRNAs increased activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)， AKT， and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)， and improved myotube formation and insulin-dependent glycogen synthesis. Moreover， antagonizing the miRNA network in vivo following CTX-induced muscle regeneration enhanced muscle mass and myofiber formation in young and aged mice.   Conclusion: Our results provide novel insights into the dynamics of miRNA cooperativity and identify a miRNA network as therapeutic target for impaired focal adhesion signalling and muscle regeneration during ageing.,We performed genome-wide identification of differentially expressed genes and miRNA target regulation after single or combinatorial miRNA inhibition in human myotubes. Human myoblasts derived from 3 donors were treated with control antagomirs or antagomirs either against let-7， miR-29a， miR-125b， miR-199， miR-221 or against all miRNAs (ant-5x).

Integrated analysis of transcript level regulation of metabolism during human adipocyte differentiation [miR],GSE41576,Homo sapiens,Here， we have focused on studying the link between metabolic changes driven by the differentiation into mature adipocytes of a human preadipocyte cell line (SGBS) and their regulation， through a combined experimental and computational approach.By collecting data on gene expression， PPARg， CEBPa， LXR and H3K4me3 genome-wide ChIP-seq profles and transcriptome-wide microRNA target identification for miR-27a， miR29a and miR-222， and using constraint-based modeling to estimate metabolic reaction activity， we obtained a comprehensive set of information highlighting how epigenetic， transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation impacts the metabolic network.,Illumina HT12 V4.0 microarrays: Transcriptome analysis 24 hours following overexpression of indicated microRNAs or control siRNAs on indicated time points of differentiation (D0 or D4 + 24 hours) (7 conditions in triplicate， total of 21 samples + siLamin transfection as positive control in duplicate)This submission represents transcriptome component of study.,24198249,Nucleic Acids Res
Human ovarian granulosa cell methylome,GSE63470,Homo sapiens,We used MethylCap-seq and RRBS to profile methylomes of purified human ovarian granulosa cells. Genomic DNA methylation patterns in ovarian granulosa cells were compared between two groups of women: i) oocyte donors (n=20) who were young (age 26 Â± 2.2 years) and had robust response to ovarian stimulation during assisted reproductive technology (ART) (mean number of oocytes retrieved = 25); versus ii) poor responders (n=20) who were older (age 40 Â± 2.3 years) and responded poorly to ovarian stimulation during ART (oocytes retrieved â¤4 and peak estradiol level â¤ 1000 pg/ml).  The first group served as healthy control.  The second group represented the majority of women in their early 40s who have the natural age-related decline of ovarian functions and therefore respond poorly to ovarian stimulation during ART.    We compared DNA methylomes in ovarian granulosa cells from oocyte donors versus poor responders using two approaches: MethylCap-seq for broader genomic coverage， and RRBS for absolute quantification.  Due to very limited amount of materials available from each poor responder， samples containing equal amounts of granulosa cell DNA were pooled from 10 individuals in each group.  A second set of experiments pooling granulosa cell DNA samples from independent donor and poor responder groups (ten individuals each) was then performed.,mix 10 individuals into one sample; compare samples with age differences,25682867,Oncotarget
Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901:del_MMP1447， a shift from a H2-excess and P-limiting condition to a H2-limited and P-excess condition in chemostats (growth rate held constant),GSE42164,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009). Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. For shifts from P-limited to P-excess conditions， phosphate was raised from 0.18 mM to the standard 0.8 mM. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C. Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
RNAseq measurement of cortisol induced gene expression change under knockout of Klf9,GSE144885,Danio rerio,We found that a frameshift deletion introduced into exon 1 of zebrafish klf9 eliminates the DNA binding domain and significantly reduces expression of the mature transcript. RNA-seq shows that klf9 is required for the pro-inflammatory transcriptomic effects of chronic cortisol treatment. klf9 is one of a core set of genes consistently found to be upregulated by chronic cortisol exposure.,We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation of klf9 and RNA-seq to assess Klf9-dependent gene expression in both normal and cortisol-treated larvae.,32651405,Sci Rep
Investigation of the gene expression changes triggered by the lung mesenchymal Tsc2KO in each major cell subpopulation of the adult mouse lung,GSE139818,Mus musculus,Tumor suppressor Tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) is a key negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)， a central controller of cell growth and metabolism in health and disease. Loss of TSC2 induces the constitutive activation of mTORC1 in rare lung disease pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)， which affects only women of childbearing age and characterized by lung destruction and progressive loss of pulmonary function. Little is known how TSC2 loss induces LAM and what is the LAM cell of origin. To determine cell-type specific effects of TSC2 loss and mTORC1 activation on lung homeostasis we generated new transgenic mice with targeted Tsc2 deletion in lung mesenchyme Tbx4-Cre+Tsc2flox/flox and lung epithelium Shh-Cre+Tsc2flox/flox. Both Tbx4-Cre+， Tsc2flox/flox and Shh-Cre+， Tsc2flox/flox mice were viable and fertile. Adult Tbx4-Cre+Tsc2flox/flox mice demonstrated mTORC1 activation in lung mesenchyme， progressive alveolar enlargement， female-specific pulmonary function decline and prgenancy-induced lesion growth. To investigate molecular mechanism underlying observed phenotypic changes in the Tsc2KO lungs  we performed comparative bulk-RNAseq analysis of the gene expression changes in the major cell subpopulations of the adult female 8-week-old Tsc2KO mouse lungs compared to the age- and sex-matched WT controls.,Cell population RNA-seq was performed in 3 biological replicates. 3 Tbx4CreTsc2KO and 3 Tbx4CreTsc2WT muse lungs were subjected to the digest and consecutive-depletion-based  magnetic beads sort using antibodies against the appropriate cell surface markers: 1) CD45+ (immune cells)， 2) CD45-EpCAM+ (Epithelilal cells)， 3) CD45-， EpCAM-， CD31+ (Vascular endothelial cells)， 4) CD45-， EpCAM-， CD31-， PDPN+ (Lymphatic endothelial cells) and 5) All negative(CD45-， EpCAM-， CD31-， PDPN-) Mesenchymal cells.

Single-cell epigenomics identifies a premetastatic regulatory program in lung adenocarcinoma [sciATAC-seq],GSE134812,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Here we use an improved single-cell chromatin profiling approach to determine epigenomic alterations across tumor progression in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Specifically， we induced tumors by providing Adeno-SPC-Cre virus to mice intratracheally to induce tumors due to conditional expression the Kras G12D mutation and loss of p53 (termed the KPT model). Mice also expressed a tdTomato reporter allele allowing for the sorting of tumor cells in late-stages of tumor progression. Using a combinatorial indexing approach (sciATAC-seq)， we identify an epigenomic continuum representing a loss of cellular identity and progression towards a metastatic state.,sciATAC-Sequencing profiles of normal lung and lung adenocarcinoma murine samples.

The dynamics of cellular response to therapeutic perturbation using multiplexed quantification of the proteome and transcriptome at single-cell resolution,GSE100501,Homo sapiens,We developed a scalable assay permitting the simultaneous quantification of hundreds of proteins and the full transcriptome in thousands of individual cells from samples where cell number is limiting.  The RNA Expression and Protein Sequencing assay (REAP-seq) uses DNA-labeled antibodies to permit DNA sequencing of both mRNA and antibodies in a single workflow using droplet microfluidics. We describe the development and validation of REAP-seq in human PBMCs， and use the assay to assess the costimulatory effects of an anti-CD27 agonist antibody in naÃ¯ve CD8+ lymphocytes. Protein quantification using REAP-seq was more sensitive than parallel mRNA measurements and differentiated cell states with fewer analytes. Unbiased profiling of single cells without prior selection enabled identification and characterization of an unexpected cell type that would have been missed with population-averaged profiling methodologies.,The RNA Expression and Protein Sequencing assay (REAP-seq) which uses DNA-labeled antibodies to permit DNA sequencing of both mRNA and antibodies in a single workflow using droplet microfluidics was developed and validated in human PBMCs and naÃ¯ve CD8+ T cells that were costimulated with either 1) aCD3 and aCD28 or 2) aCD3， aCD28 and aCD27.,28854175,Nat Biotechnol

E2F1 orchestrates transcriptomics and oxidative metabolism in Whartonâs jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells from growth-restricted neonates,GSE77260,Homo sapiens,Whartonâs jelly derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) isolated from newborns with intrauterine fetal growth restriction were previously shown to exert anabolic features including insulin hypersensitivity. Here， we extend these observations and demonstrate that MSCs from small for gestational age (SGA) individuals have decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Comparing normally grown and SGA MSCs using next generation sequencing studies， we measured global transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles and identified in SGA， E2F1 as an over-expressed transcription factor regulating oxidative metabolism. We further show that E2F1 regulates the differential transcriptome found in SGA and is associated with the activating histone marks H3K27ac and H3K4me3. One of the key genes regulated by E2F1 was found to be the fatty acid elongase ELOVL2， a gene involved in the endogenous synthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).,ChIP-seq of E2F1， H3K27ac， H3K27me3， H3K36me3， H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in MSCs from 3 AGA and 3 SGA samples.

Zfp281 functions as a barrier in embryonic stem cells to extraembryonic endoderm stem cells differentiation [RNA-seq],GSE154398,Mus musculus,Cell-fate decisions and lineage commitment in early embryonic development are governed by comprehensive gene-regulatory programs. However， the molecular details leading to initial segregation of different lineages remain unclear. In the second cell-fate decision， epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PrE) lineages are formed from the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) cells at blastocyst stage. Here， we demonstrated that the pluripotency transcription factor Zfp281 is a barrier in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to PrE lineage differentiation. Zfp281 is expressed in extraembryonic endoderm cells (XENs)， the ex vivo derivatives of PrE. But knockdown of Zfp281 doesnât affect either maintenance or expression of the PrE master regulators in XENs. Using an in vitro differentiation protocol， we revealed that knockout of Zfp281 significantly increased the efficiency of ESC to XEN derivation. Using a Zfp281 rescue line for the knockout cells， we further confirmed that effects of elevated efficiency of XEN derivation is specifically due to loss of Zfp281. Mechanistically， we revealed that Zfp281 interacts with components in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)， and recruits PRC2 to promoters of PrE master regulators GATA4 and GATA6 for transcriptional and epigenetic repression. Taken together， our results demonstrated a novel role of Zfp281 in second cell-fate decision in embryonic stem cell differentiation.,RNA sequencing analysis was performed in WT and Zfp281KO ESCs， XENs， and intermediate cells during ESC-to-XEN differentiation,32812113,Protein Cell
Dynamic and static maintenance of epigenetic memory in pluripotent and somatic cells [human],GSE53610,Homo sapiens,Stable maintenance of gene regulatory programs is essential for normal function in multi-cellular organisms. Epigenetic mechanisms， and DNA methylation in particular， are hypothesized to facilitate such maintenance by creating cellular memory that can be written during embryonic development and then guide cell-type specific gene expression. Here we use new methods to study distributions of DNA methylation patterns within cell populations to show that embryonic stem cells preserve their epigenetic state by balancing antagonistic processes that add and remove methylation marks rather than by copying epigenetic information from mother to daughter cells. Quantitative tuning of this equilibrium leads to convergence into a binary epigenetic configuration maintaining a sharp distinction between methylated and unmethylated regions. In contrast， somatic cells transmit considerable epigenetic information from mother to daughter cell. Paradoxically， the persistence of the somatic epigenome makes it more vulnerable to noise， since random epi-mutations can be preserved and accumulate to massively perturb the binary epigenomic ground state. Epigenetic perturbation is not observed in the pluripotent state， since the rapid turnover-based equilibrium continuously reinforces the canonical state. This dynamic epigenetic equilibrium also explains how the somatic epigenome can be reprogrammed quickly and accurately following induced pluripotency.,Comparison of single cell clonal population DNA methylation variation to the original population in 6 cell lines and 1 primary,25043040,Nature
High-throughput single-cell mitochondrial DNA genotyping reveals properties of clonal variation in human contexts [HumanMix],GSE142740,Homo sapiens,Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation plays a fundamental role in human disease and enables the clonal tracing of native human cells. While various genotyping approaches revealed mutational heterogeneity in human tissues and single cells， current methodologies are limited by scale. Here， we introduce a high-throughput， droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (mtscATAC-seq) protocol and computational framework that facilitate high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells. Further， the concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin readout enables the paired inference of individual cell mtDNA heteroplasmy， clonal lineage， cell state， and accessible chromatin regulatory features. Our multi-omic analyses reveals single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant (m.8344A>G)， which we tie to intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. Further， using somatic mtDNA mutations， we clonally trace thousands of hematopoietic cells in vitro and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia， linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution in vivo.Â,Mix of two human cell lines， TF1 and GM11906， were processed together using a modified 10x scATAC-seq protocol as detailed in the manuscript related to this work.,32788668,Nat Biotechnol
Î²-catenin safeguards the ground state of pluripotency by strengthening the robustness of the transcriptional apparatus [GRO-seq],GSE140340,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured with MEK and GSK3 inhibitors (2i) more closely resemble the inner cell mass of pre-implantation blastocysts than those cultured with serum/LIF (SL). The transcriptional mechanisms governing this pluripotent ground state are yet unresolved. Release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol2) is a multistep process necessary for pluripotency and cell cycle gene transcription in SL. Here， we show that Î²-catenin， stabilized by GSK3 inhibition in 2i， supplies transcriptional co-regulators including BRD4， CDK9， Mediator， Cohesin， and p300 at pluripotency loci. This selectively strengthens pluripotency loci and renders them addicted to transcription initiation for productive gene body elongation in detriment to Pol2 pause release. By contrast， cell cycle genes are not bound by Î²-catenin and， thus， proliferation/self-renewal are still tightly controlled by the Pol2 pause release mechanism under 2i conditions. Our findings help to explain how pluripotency is preserved in the ground state and also provide a general model for transcriptional resilience/adaptation upon network perturbation in other biological contexts.,GRO-seq of mouse ESCs cultured in different conditions.,32832621,Sci Adv
A single-cell transcriptomics CRISPR-activation screen identifies new epigenetic regulators of the zygotic genome activation progrmme (bulk RNA-seq of arrayed CRISPRa validations and bulk RNA-seq of Patz1， Dppa2， Smarca5 and Carhsp1 cDNA overexpression),GSE135512,Mus musculus,Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is a crucial developmental milestone that remains poorly understood. This first essential transcriptional event in embryonic development coincides with extensive epigenetic reprogramming and is orchestrated， in part， by the interplay of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. Here， we developed a novel high-throughput screening method that combines pooled CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics and applied this method to systematically probe candidate regulators of ZGA-like transcription. We screened 230 epigenetic and transcriptional factors by upregulating their expression with CRISPRa in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)， we generated approximately 200，000 single-cell transcriptomes of CRISPRa-perturbed cells， each transduced with a unique short-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a specific candidate gene promoter. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) of the perturbation scRNA-seq profiles， we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response in ESCs， both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome. We further validated nine candidate genes by arrayed CRISPRa analysed by bulk transcriptomics， which demonstrates that the combination of CRISPRa with scRNA-seq is a powerful and valid approach to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription. Additional cDNA overexpression assays for three top hits， the DNA binding protein Dppa2， the chromatin remodeller Smarca5 and the transcription factor Patz1， confirmed these factors as ZGA-like regulators by alternative methods. Supporting these findings， Dppa2 and Smarca5 knock-out ESCs lose expression of ZGA genes and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5?s regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2.

BMP signaling cooperates with GATA factors to govern stage-specific gene expression during erythroid differentiation [RNA-Seq],GSE74482,Homo sapiens,Hematopoietic progenitors respond to developmental and environmental cues to differentiate. The stage-specific steps of differentiation are stereotypic for each cell lineage， and are controlled by transcription. Here we investigate how differential genomic binding of signal-responsive and lineage-restricted transcription factors can specify subsequent stages of erythropoiesis. Using a human erythroid differentiation system， we extensively characterized the co-operation of the BMP signaling transcription factor SMAD1 with the erythroid transcription factors GATA2 and GATA1 in a detailed time-course.

A single-cell transcriptomics CRISPR-activation screen identifies new epigenetic regulators of the zygotic genome activation programme (10X Genomics 3' scRNA-seq of MERVL LTR and Zscan4 CRISPRa dataset),GSE135554,Mus musculus,Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is a crucial developmental milestone that remains poorly understood. This first essential transcriptional event in embryonic development coincides with extensive epigenetic reprogramming and is orchestrated， in part， by the interplay of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. Here， we developed a novel high-throughput screening method that combines pooled CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics and applied this method to systematically probe candidate regulators of ZGA-like transcription. We screened 230 epigenetic and transcriptional factors by upregulating their expression with CRISPRa in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)， we generated approximately 200，000 single-cell transcriptomes of CRISPRa-perturbed cells， each transduced with a unique short-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a specific candidate gene promoter. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) of the perturbation scRNA-seq profiles， we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response in ESCs， both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome. We further validated nine candidate genes by arrayed CRISPRa analysed by bulk transcriptomics， which demonstrates that the combination of CRISPRa with scRNA-seq is a powerful and valid approach to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription.

Î²-catenin safeguards the ground state of pluripotency by strengthening the robustness of the transcriptional apparatus [RNA-seq],GSE123691,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured with inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 (2iL) more closely resemble the pre-implantation embryo inner cell mass than cultures in serum/LIF (SL). Unveiling the differences between both systems is important for understanding development and could also assist in isolating an ESC equivalent for other mammalian species. In SL， pluripotency and cell cycle gene transcription is a multistep process requiring release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol2) by the histone acetylation reader BRD4 and the Pol2 kinase CDK9. Here， we show that recruitment of co-regulators including Mediator and Cohesin by Î²-catenin changes the mode of transcriptional regulation at BRD4/CDK9-bound loci in 2iL. This switch renders pluripotency genes more reliant on transcriptional initiation and less on Pol2 pause release for effective gene body elongation. Conversely， cell cycle genes are not bound by Î²-catenin and are still dependent on Pol2 pause release. Thus， pluripotency is more resistant to BRD4/CDK9 suppression in 2iL while self-renewal remains highly sensitive. Our findings help to explain how pluripotency is shielded in the ground state and provide insight into transcriptional adaptation upon network perturbation in other contexts.,RNA-seq of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured either with inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 (2iL)  or cultured in serum/LIF (SL)， and treated with DMSO or JQ1 (100nM).,32832621,Sci Adv
Rare cell variability and drug-induced reprogramming as a mode of cancer drug resistance [ATAC-seq],GSE97680,Homo sapiens,Therapies targeting signaling molecules mutated in cancers can often have striking short-term effects， but the emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full cures. Resistance can sometimes result from a secondary mutations in rare cells， but other times， there is no clear genetic cause， raising leaving the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here， we show that melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces an epigenetic reprogramming in these cells， converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins withis a progressive process consisting of a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signaling pathways， partially mediated by activity of Jun-AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression of many of these same marker genes， suggesting the existence of a general rare-cell expression program.,We performed FACS to isolate EGFR-high populations of WM989 melanoma cells at three time points (untreated， 1 week in vemurafenib， 4 weeks in vemurafenib) for RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing.

A saturating mutagenesis CRISPR-Cas9 mediated functional genomic screen identifies cis- and trans- regulatory elements of Oct4 in embryonic stem cells (ATAC-seq),GSE140909,Mus musculus,Regulatory elements (REs) consist of enhancers and promoters that occupy a significant portion of the non-coding genome and control gene expression programs either in âcis or in âtrans. Putative REs have been identified largely based on their regulatory features (co-occupancy of ESC-specific transcription factors， enhancer histone marks and DNase hypersensitivity) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However， less has been established regarding their regulatory functions in their native context. We deployed cis- and trans-regulatory elements scanning through saturating mutagenesis and sequencing (ctSCAN-SMS) to target elements within the ~12kb cis-region of the Oct4 gene locus， as well as genome-wide 2，613 high-confidence trans-REs (TREs)， in mESCs. The ctSCAN-SMS identified 10 CREs and 12 TREs， as novel candidate REs of the Oct4 gene in mESCs. Furthermore， deletion of these REs confirmed that the majority of the CREs and TREs are functionally active， and involved in regulating Oct4 gene expression. Additionally， a subset of the functional CREs and TREs physically interact with the Oct4 promoter to varying degrees through intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions， respectively. Comparative genomics analysis reveals that functional CREs are more conserved in terms of their regulatory sequence conservation between mouse and primates (including humans) than TREs. Notably， a few active CREs are devoid of canonical regulatory features. Taken together， our work demonstrates the reliability and robustness of ctSCAN-SMS screening to identify critical REs， and probe their roles in the regulation of transcriptional output of a target gene (in this case Oct4).,ATAC-seq from 0， 8， 24， 96hr time points (undifferentiated to differentiated state) of wild-type (Zhbt-Oct4) mESCs; ATAC-seq from wild-type (J1) mESCs,32994224,J Biol Chem

Epithelial cells in 2D and 3D culture exhibit significant differences in long-range genomic interactions [Hi-C],GSE136306,Mus musculus,Recent studies have characterized the genomic structures of many eukaryotic cells， often with a focus on their relation to gene expression. So far， these studies have largely only investigated cells grown in 2D culture， although the transcriptomes of 3D cultured cells are generally closer to their in vivo phenotype. To examine the effects of spatial constraints on chromosome conformation， we investigated the genomic architecture of mouse hepatocytes grown in 2D and 3D cultures using in situ Hi-C. Our results reveal significant differences in long-range genomic interactions， notably in compartment identity and strength as well as in TAD-TAD interactions， but only minor differences at the TAD level. RNA-seq analysis reveals an up-regulation in the 3D cultured cells of those genes involved in physiological hepatocyte functions. We find that these genes are associated with only a subset of the structural changes， suggesting that the differences in genomic structure are indeed critically important for transcriptional regulation but also that there are major structural differences owing to other functions than gene expression. Overall， our results indicate that growth in 3D significantly alters longer-range genomic interactions， which may be consequential for a subset of genes that are important for the physiological functioning of the cell.,The genome-wide interactome were generated using in-situ Hi-C method in both ltwo-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultured AML12 cells which were arrest at G1/S,33631432,Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics
Drosophila voltage-gated sodium channels are only expressed in active neurons and are localized to distal axonal initial segment-like domains,GSE157202,Drosophila melanogaster,In multipolar vertebrate neurons， action potentials (AP) initiate close to the soma， at the axonal initial segment (AIS). Invertebrate neurons are typically unipolar with dendrites integrating directly into the axon. Where APs are initiated in the axons of invertebrate neurons is unclear. Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels are a functional hallmark of the AIS in vertebrates. We used an intronic MiMIC to determine the endogenous gene expression and subcellular localization of the sole NaV channel in both male and female Drosophila， para. Despite being the only NaV channel in the fly， we show that only 23 Â±1% of neurons in the embryonic and larval CNS express para， while in the adult CNS para is broadly expressed. We generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the whole 3rd instar larval brain to identify para expressing neurons and show that it positively correlates with markers of differentiated， actively firing neurons. Therefore only 23 Â±1% of larval neurons may be capable of firing NaV-dependent APs. We then show that Para is enriched in an axonal segment， distal to the site of dendritic integration into the axon， which we named the Distal Axonal Segment (DAS). The DAS is present in multiple neuron classes in both the 3rd instar larval and adult CNS. Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of adult CNS fly neurons are consistent with the interpretation that Nav-dependent APs originate in the DAS.  Identification of the distal NaV localization in fly neurons will enable more accurate interpretation of electrophysiological recordings in invertebrates.,scRNA-seq (10x Genomics CHROMIUM Single Cell 3â Solution V2 Chemistry) of fresh and fixed third instar larval brains from genotype mixed Drosophila melanogaster,32928889,J Neurosci
Massively parallel and time-resolved RNA sequencing in single cells with scNT-Seq,GSE141851,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Single-cell RNA sequencing offers snapshots of whole transcriptomes but obscures the temporal RNA dynamics. Here we present single-cell metabolically labeled new RNA tagging sequencing (scNT-Seq)， a method for massively parallel analysis of newly-transcribed and pre-existing mRNAs from the same cell. This droplet microfluidics-based method enables high-throughput chemical conversion on barcoded beads， efficiently marking newly-transcribed mRNAs with T-to-C substitutions. With scNT-Seq， we jointly profiled new and old transcriptomes in ~55，000 single cells. These data revealed time-resolved transcription factor activities and cell state trajectories at single-cell level in response to neuronal activation. We further determined rates of RNA biogenesis and decay to uncover RNA regulatory strategies during stepwise conversion between pluripotent and rare totipotent two-cell-embryo-like (2C-like) stem cell states. Finally， integrating scNT-Seq with genetic perturbation identifies DNA methylcytosine dioxygenases as an epigenetic barrier into 2C-like cell state. Time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic analysis thus opens new lines of inquiry regarding cell-type-specific RNA regulatory mechanisms.,Single-cell metabolically labeled new RNA tagging sequencing,32868927,Nat Methods
Single Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Chondrogenesis [bulk RNA-seq],GSE160786,Homo sapiens,It has been notoriously challenging for researchers in the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine to robustly generate uniform populations of differentiated cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In particular， the process of iPSC chondrogenesis has been difficult to reproduce among different laboratories.  While several differentiation protocols are being developed， few， if any， yield homogenous hiPSC-derived chondrocytes without any off-target contaminating cells. To improve homogeneity of hiPSC chondrogenesis， we have developed the first application of single-cell RNA sequencing to systemically deconstruct each differentiation step and delineate molecular mechanisms underlying lineage commitment of hiPSCs toward chondrocytes. We identified that MITF as well as several specific canonical and non-canonical WNTs are hub genes of gene regulatory networks governing the off-target differentiation into neural cells and melanocytes during hiPSC chondrogenesis. By inhibiting these off-target molecules， we significantly enhanced chondrogenic lineage commitment of hiPSCs without cell sorting. Using sequencing data of day 28 (pellet time point) as an example， the percentage of chondrocytes within the pellet was improved from 59.63% (standard protocol) to 87.92% (optimized protocol; note: the other 12.07% belong to mesenchymal cells). Importantly， none of the off-target neural cells and melanocytes were detected， suggesting 100% removal of off-target differentiation by the optimized method. Our optimized protocol was validated by 3 unique hiPSC lines and 3 unique hMSC lines， indicating the protocol can be broadly applied to multiple cell lines. Moreover， therapeutic efficacy of hiPSC-derived chondrocytes was further validated in vivo by subcutaneous implantation and osteochondral defect repair in immunodeficient mice.  In addition to the 11 consecutive time points from mesodermal to chondrogenic differentiation stages that were sequenced by bulk RNA-seq， we also sequenced 14 chondrogenic time points at single cell resolution. We believe that our bioinformatic analyses including gene regulatory networks， multicellular signaling models， as well as the large amount of data reported here will provide invaluable resources to investigate cell fate decision during human cartilage development.,Bulk RNA sequencing of the samples from various time points over the course of mesodermal and chondrogenic differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells.

genesorteR: Feature Ranking in Clustered Single Cell Data,GSE136950,Homo sapiens,Marker genes identified in single cell experiments are expected to be highly specific to a certain cell type and highly expressed in that cell type.

BMP signaling cooperates with GATA factors to govern stage-specific gene expression during erythroid differentiation [ChIP-Seq],GSE74479,Homo sapiens,Hematopoietic progenitors respond to developmental and environmental cues to differentiate.

BMP signaling enhances erythroid differentiation. SMAD1 is co-recruited with GATA factors at stage-specific genes that are required to have high expression in each stage.

Transcriptional Signaling Centers Regulate Erythroid Gene Expression and are Disrupted in Common Variations of Human Red Blood Cell Traits,GSE104574,Homo sapiens,Hematopoietic progenitors respond to developmental and environmental cues to differentiate. The stage-specific steps of differentiation are stereotypic for each cell lineage， and are controlled by transcription. Here we investigate how differential genomic binding of signal-responsive and lineage-restricted transcription factors can specify subsequent stages of erythropoiesis. Using a human erythroid differentiation system， we extensively characterized the co-operation of the BMP signaling transcription factor SMAD1 with the erythroid transcription factors GATA2 and GATA1 in a detailed time-course. BMP signaling enhances erythroid differentiation. SMAD1 is co-recruited with GATA factors at stage-specific genes that are required to have high expression in each stage. Additionally， we observed SMAD1-GATA co-enriched regions are within super-enhancers and span accessible chromatin. Co-bound regions harbor cell-type specific transcription factor motifs that change during commitment， in contrast to GATA-alone regions. Our studies demonstrate that signal-responsive factors together with lineage regulators mark genomic âhotspotsâ that function to regulate stage-specific gene expression.,ChIP-Seq for H3K27ac， GATA1， GATA2， and SMAD1， after a 2hr pulse of hrBMP， on progenitor and differentiating human CD34+ cells towards erythrocytes.,33230299,Nat Genet
Gene expression profiles of SIRT6-deficient pancreatic beta cells from Ngn3-Cre Sirt6 f/f and MIP1-CreERT Sirt6 f/f mice,GSE104161,Mus musculus,Purpose: The complete understanding of how genetic and epigenetic components control beta cell differentiation and function is key to the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent beta cell dysfunction and failure in the progression of type 2 diabetes. Our goal was to elucidate the role of histone deacetylase SIRT6 in beta-cell development and homeostasis.Methods: The Sirt6 endocrine progenitor cell conditional knockout (EKO) and beta-cell-specific knockout (BKO) mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. Mice were assayed for islet morphology， glucose tolerance， glucose-stimulated insulin secretion， and susceptibility to streptozotocin. Transcriptional regulatory functions of SIRT6 in primary islets were evaluated by RNA-seq analysis. RT-qPCR and immunoblot were used to verify and investigate the gene expression changes. Chromatin occupancies of SIRT6， H3K9Ac， H3K56Ac， and active RNA Polymerase II were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation.Results: Deletion of Sirt6 in pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells did not affect endocrine morphology， beta cell mass， or insulin production， but did result in glucose intolerance and defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mice. Conditional deletion of Sirt6 in adult beta cells reproduced the insulin secretion defect. Loss of Sirt6 resulted in aberrant upregulation of TXNIP. SIRT6 deficiency led to increased accumulations of H3K9Ac， H3K56Ac， and active RNA polymerase II at the promoter region of Txnip. SIRT6-deficient beta cells exhibited a time-dependent increase of H3K9Ac， H3K56Ac， and TXNIP levels. Furthermore， beta-cell-specific SIRT6 deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to streptozotocin.Conclusions: Our results reveal that SIRT6 suppresses Txnip expression in beta-cells via deacetylation of histone H3 and plays a critical role in maintaining beta-cell function and viability. Agents that preserve SIRT6 activity may be beneficial for preventing the progression of type 2 diabetes.,Profiles of pancreatic beta cells gene expression from 2-week post tamoxifen MIP1-CreERT Sirt6 f/f and 2-month-old Ngn3-Cre Sirt6 f/f male mice were generated by RNA-sequencing with duplicate using Illumina HiSeq 2000 and 3000. Samples from MIP-CreERT Sirt6 f/+， MIP-CreERT Sirt6 +/+， and Ngn3-Cre Sirt6 +/+， which did not show phenotype， were used as controls for BKO and EKO models， respectively， in the differential gene expression analysis.,29322219,Diabetologia
RNA editing in cancer impacts mRNA abundance in immune response pathways,GSE147487,Homo sapiens,RNA editing generates modifications to RNA sequences， thereby increasing protein diversity and shaping various layers of gene regulation. Recent studies have revealed global shifts in editing levels across many cancer types， as well as a few specific mechanisms implicating individual sites in tumorigenesis or metastasis. However， most tumor-associated sites， predominantly in noncoding regions， have unknown functional relevance. Here， we carry out integrative analysis of RNA editing profiles between epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) tumors， since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key paradigm for metastasis. We identify distinct editing patterns between E and M tumors in seven cancer types using TCGA data， an observation further supported by single-cell RNA-seq data and ADAR perturbation experiments in cell culture. Through computational analyses and experimental validations， we show that differential editing sites between E and M phenotypes function by regulating mRNA abundance of their respective genes. Our analysis of >120 RNA-binding proteins revealed ILF3 as a potential regulator of this process， supported by experimental validations. Consistent with the known roles of ILF3 in immune response， E-M differential editing sites are enriched in genes involved in immune and viral processes. The strongest target of editing-dependent ILF3 regulation is the transcript encoding PKR， a crucial player in immune and viral response. Our study reports widespread differences in RNA editing between epithelial and mesenchymal tumors and a novel mechanism of editing-dependent regulation of mRNA abundance. It reveals the broad impact of RNA editing in cancer and its relevance to cancer-related immune pathways.,eCLIP-seq in A549 cells.RNA-seq in A549 cells upon knockdown of ADARs.,33106178,Genome Biol

An epigenetic program established by gene â environment interactions initiates pancreatic carcinogenesis [Set3],GSE154543,Mus musculus,Damaged tissues have increased risk of cancer development through poorly understood mechanisms. In the pancreas， tissue damage collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to dramatically accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and ultimately pancreatic cancer. By integrating genomics， single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally-controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous mouse models， we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a unique chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is selected for throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges within 48 hours of pancreatic injury， and involves large-scale chromatin accessibility changes that contribute to the early dysregulation of genes defining human pancreatic cancer. Among the genes most rapidly activated by tissue damage in the pre-malignant pancreatic epithelium is the alarmin cytokine IL33， which cooperates with mutant Kras in unleashing the epigenetic remodeling program of early neoplasia and neoplastic transformation in the absence of injury. Collectively， our study demonstrates how gene-environment interactions can rapidly produce gene regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment and provides a molecular framework for understanding the interplay between genetics and environmental cues in cancer initiation.,Characterization of the transcriptional profiles (RNA-seq) of bulk lineage-traced Kras-mutant pancreatic epithelial cells isolated by FACS-sorting from pancreata of Kras-mutant KC (p48-Cre;RIK;LSLKrasG12D) or Kras wild-type C (p48-Cre;RIK) mice treated with murine recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) or PBS.,33536616,Nature

Activation of clustered IFNÎ³ target genes drives cohesin-controlled transcriptional memory [RNA-seq_SCC1-AID],GSE150197,Homo sapiens,Cytokine activation of cells induces gene networks involved in inflammation and immunity. Transient gene activation can have a lasting impact even in the absence of ongoing transcription， known as long-term transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment and maintenance of IFNÎ³-induced priming of human cells. We find that while both ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived， the IFNÎ³-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression， correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further， we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration， stochastic nature and molecular mechanisms of IFNÎ³-induced transcriptional memory， relevant to understanding of enhanced innate immune signaling.,Transcriptome measurements of polyA mRNA for HeLa cells with SCC1 component of cohesin tagged with an AID degron (SCC1-AID). osTIR1 E3 ligase either present (TIR1+) or not (TIR1-).

Defining the Teratoma as a Model for Multi-Lineage Human Development,GSE156170,Homo sapiens,Studying early human developmental processes requires access to a model system that is easy to perturb， either genetically or chemically， genetically tractable and recapitulates key features of organogenesis. We propose that the teratoma， a recognized standardused for for validating pluripotency in stem cells， could be a promising platform for modeling human development.

In mammals， DNA methylation deposited at non-CG dinucleotides characterises brain epigenomes. However， it is unclear to what extent this non-canonical form of DNA methylation is evolutionarily conserved. To test this we profile brain cytosine methylation across the major vertebrate lineages， amphioxus， honeybee and octopus， finding that non-CG methylation in adult brain methylomes is restricted to vertebrates. In vertebrates， the genomic patterns of non-CG do not recapitulate those of CG methylation， yet both patterns are deeply conserved. Whereas low levels of gene body CG methylation demarcate a set of developmental transcription factors across tissues and species， a distinct set of neurodevelopmental genes accumulate non-CG methylation in neural tissues. We further show that the establishment of this methylation context coincides with the origin of the âwriterâ of non-CG methylation， the methyltransferase DNMT3A， and the âreaderâ， the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)， fuelled by the ancestral whole genome duplication in vertebrates. Surprisingly， MeCP2 evolved in a stepwise process， from an ancestral MBD4 protein with a dual role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair in chordates. In sum， we show how a novel neural epigenomic layer assembled at the root of vertebrates and gained new regulatory roles partly independent from CG methylation， which could have fostered the sophisticated cognitive repertoires found in the vertebrate lineage.,Profiling of cytosine methylation for brain samples from Monodelphis domestica， Ornithorhynchus anatinus， Gallus gallus， Callorhinchus milii， Lethenteron camtschaticum， Apis mellifera， Octopus bimaculoides， and Branchiostoma lanceolatum.,33462491,Nat Ecol Evol
Translational Regulation of Metabolic Dynamics during Effector-Triggered Immunity,GSE124115,Arabidopsis thaliana,It is not fully known whether translational regulation also occurs in later stage immune responses， such as effector-triggered immunity (ETI)， which often leads to strong metabolic dynamics. In this study， we performed a genome-wide ribosome profiling in Arabidopsis upon ETI activation and discovered that specific groups of genes were translationally regulated， especially metabolic genes in aromatic amino acid， phenylpropanoid， camalexin， and sphingolipid metabolism. The involvement of these components in the induction of ETI was confirmed by genetic analysis， amino acid profiling and exogeneous application of phenylalanine or an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Our findings provide new insight into the diverse translational regulation in the plant immune responses and demonstrate that translational coordination of metabolic gene expression is an important strategy for ETI activation.,Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the 35S:uORFsTBF1-LUC construct in WT Col-0 (C) background or rps2 (R)Â background were grown on soil at 22 Â°C under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle with 55% humidity.

An epigenetic program established by gene â environment interactions initiates pancreatic carcinogenesis  [ATAC-seq],GSE132440,Mus musculus,Damaged tissues have increased risk of cancer development through poorly understood mechanisms. For example， in the pancreas， tissue damage collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to dramatically accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and， ultimately， pancreatic cancer. By integrating genomics， single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally-controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous tumor models， we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a functionally relevant chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is inherited throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges remarkably fast， involves chromatin accessibility changes not induced by pancreatic injury alone， and contributes to the early activation of neoplasia specific genes that define advanced human pancreatic cancer. Among the genes activated by injury-facilitated chromatin reprogramming are a series of known and novel cancer-related factors， including the alarmin cytokine IL33， which cooperates with mutant Kras in driving neoplastic transformation in the absence of tissue damage. Collectively， our study demonstrates how gene-environment interactions can rapidly produce gene regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment and provides a molecular framework for understanding the cooperation between genetics and environmental cues in cancer initiation.,Characterization of the chromatin accessibility profiles of lineage-traced pancreatic epithelial cells isolated directly by FACS-sorting (mKate2+ or GFP+) from normal， regenerating， early neoplastic and malignant murine pancreatic tissues: To compare the effects of tissue injury in mutant Kras-expressing or Kras wild-type pancreatic epithelial cells， cells were sorted from KC;RIK (p48-Cre;RIK;LSLKrasG12D) or C;RIK (p48-Cre;RIK) male mice treated with caerulein or PBS (vehicle control) at 5 weeks of age， using littermates when possibe.

Single-cell RNA transcriptomics of thymic iNKT cells from C57BL/6 and Hivep3-/- mice,GSE152786,Mus musculus,Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of murine thymic iNKT cells from two independent C57BL/6 mice and two independent Hivep3-deficient mice,Processed thymocytes were enriched for PBS57-CD1d reactive cells by incubating thymocyte cell suspensions with PE or APC conjugated PBS57-CD1d tetramers for 45 minutes at 4C， then incubated with anti-PE or anti-APC magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 minutes at 4C， followed by separation by using an autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturerâs instructions.

Identification of required host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells [ECCITE-seq],GSE159519,Homo sapiens,To better understand host-virus genetic dependencies and find potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19， we performed a genome-scale CRISPR loss-of-function screen to identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of human alveolar epithelial cells. Top-ranked genes cluster into distinct pathways， including the vacuolar ATPase proton pump， Retromer， and Commander complexes. We validate these gene targets using several orthogonal methods such as CRISPR knock-out， RNA interference knock-down， and small-molecule inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA- sequencing， we identify shared transcriptional changes in cholesterol biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes. In addition， given the key role of the ACE2 receptor in the early stages of viral entry， we show that loss of RAB7A reduces viral entry by sequestering the ACE2 receptor inside cells. Overall， this work provides a genome- scale， quantitative resource of the impact of the loss of each host gene on fitness/response to viral infection.,Identification of systemic changes upon SARS-CoV-2 entry hit gene perturbation using ECCITE-seq.ECCITE-seq (Expanded CRISPR-compatible Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing),33147445,Cell
Comparative analysis of global transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli and Schizosaccharomyces pombe in respiratory and fermentative growth: Inferring the evolution of analog circuits of post-transcriptional regulation,GSE138088,Escherichia coli;Schizosaccharomyces pombe,"Next Generation sequencing techniques have ushered in a new era in life sciences， especially genomic research. Currently， massive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has increased knowledge about the ""RNA universe"" from the global characterization of transcriptomes， differential gene expression studies and the continued discovery of non-coding regulatory transcripts such as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Post-transcriptional gene regulation is a mechanism for controlling gene expression that is present in both prokaryote and eukaryote organisms and regulates multiple biological processes. Examples of ncRNAs that regulate the levels of transcripts of genes related to central carbon metabolism have been described in bacteria and higher eukaryotes. In order to describe whether analogies exist in regulatory circuits mediated by ncRNAs in two cell patterns， a comparative analysis of the transcriptome of Escherichia coli and Schizosaccharomyces pombe in similar growth conditions was carried out using two carbon source， 2 % glucose and a mix of 2% glycerol and 0.2 % sodium acetate. Twelve RNA-seq libraries were performed. The RNA-seq data contained a number unambiguously mapped readings on the genome of each organism ranged from 1-1.3 million. A total of 739 and 743 genes were detected as differentially expressed for E. coli and S， pombe respectively with a module of log FC > 1 and FDR > 0.05. In aerobic glicolisis GO asciated to cell proliferetionweres detected in both organisms. Among the genes differentially expressed in glycerol/acetate general transcription factors such as fliA， 11 literature validated sRNAs， and assembly flagellum maquinary gene were detected in E. coli， whereas in fission yeast， hexose transporters， switches integral membrane proteins and ncRNAs related to cellular stress are highlighted.

AÂ Genome-wide Chronological Study of Gene Expression and Two HistoneÂ Modifications， H3K4me3 and H3K9ac， during Developmental Leaf Senescence [ChIP-seq],GSE67776,Arabidopsis thaliana,The genome-wide abundance of two histone modifications， H3K4me3 and H3K9ac， both associated with actively expressed genes， was monitored in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves at different time points during developmental senescence， along with expression in the form of RNA-seq data. H3K9ac and H3K4me3 marks were highly convergent at all stages of leaf aging， but H3K4me3 marks covered nearly twice the gene area as H3K9ac marks. Genes with the greatest fold-change in expression displayed the largest positively-correlated percent change in coverage for both marks. Most senescence up-regulated genes were pre-marked by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac， but at levels below the whole-genome average， and for these genes， gene expression increased without a significant increase in either histone mark. However， for a subset of genes showing increased or decreased expression， the respective gain or loss of H3K4me3 marks were found to closely match the temporal changes in mRNA abundance. 22% of genes that increased expression during senescence showed accompanying changes in H3K4me3 modification， and they include numerous regulatory genes， which may act as primary response genes.,H3K4me3 and H3K9ac were measured on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-seq at different stages of leaf aging.,25802367,Plant Physiol
Single cell RNA sequencing reveals fetal ovary development in Macaca fascicularis,GSE149629,Macaca fascicularis,The germ cells are vital for reproduction and heredity. However， the mechanisms for female germ cell development in primates， especially in late embryonic stage， has remained elusive. Here， we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 12471 cells from fetal ovaries. We identified five cell types (germ cell， granulosa cell， theca cell， endothelial cell， macrophage cell)， and explored the interactions between germ cells and niche cells. Interestingly， we demonstrated that two waves of oogenesis occur during fetal ovary development and ZGLP1 could activate oogenic program and is essential for meiosis initiation. Furthermore， late formed double strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by PRDM9 may lead to the apoptosis of germ cells during cyst breakdown process. Moreover， our study identified the origin of theca cells that may derive from Leydig cell like cells in fetal ovaries. Overall， our work provides new insights into the molecular and cellular basis of fetal ovary development at single-cell resolution.,Single cell RNA sequencing on fetal ovary cells was performed from  Macaca fascicularis.,33372178,Cell Discov
RNA-Seq: assessment of transcript level analysis tools [seq],GSE71802,Mus musculus,This study uses spiked-in transcript in order to compares various bioinformatics approaches and tools to assemble， quantify abundance and detect differentially expressed transcripts using RNA-Seq data. Mouse total RNA seq was extracted from embryonic stem cells (ES) before (designated as day 0) and four days after the addition of retinoic acid. 48 spikes were made in vitro from plasmid constructs and added to the total RNA in different concentrations (each mix has a set of different spike concentrations， see paper's method). We found that detection of differential expression at the gene level is acceptable， yet on the transcript-isofom level all tools tested were lacking accuracy and precision.,Mouse total RNA was extracted from embryonic stem cells (ES) before (designated as day 0) and four days after the addition of retinoic acid (RA) (designated as day 4). Mouse spike-ins consisting of 48 different mouse RNA transcripts were generated in vitro from plasmid constructs and added to the total RNA. 23 of the spike-ins originate from 10 different locus regions， so that each locus is represented by at least two different transcripts. The remaining 25 spike-ins represent different loci.,27100792,PLoS One
Global transcriptomic changes following elevated carbon dioxide (5%) in the wild-type (WT) and mutant (M2; RNAi-knockdown line of carbonic anhydrase (CA2)) Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1: Illumina sequencing,GSE115445,Nannochloropsis oceanica,In Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1， transcript knockdown of a cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CA2; g2018) specifically inhibited by HC resulted in ~45%， ~30% and ~40% elevation of photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate， growth rate and biomass accumulation rate under high CO2 (5% )， respectively. This CA2-knockdown mutant is demonated as M2. To probe mechanistic links underlying the mutant (M2; RNAi-knockdown line of carbonic anhydrase (CA2)) phenotypes， temporal transcriptomic profiles are compared between RNAi-knockdown line of carbonic anhydrase (CA2) and WT， at 12 h and 24h under high CO2 (5%).,Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 wild-type and M2 (RNAi-knockdown line of carbonic anhydrase (CA2)) cells were grown in liquid cultures under continuous light (approximately 80Â±5 Âµmol photons m-2 s-1) at 25â and aerated by bubbling with a mixture of 5% CO2 in air. Mid-logarithmic phase algal cells were collected and washed three times with axenic seawater. Equal numbers of cells were re-inoculated in fresh medium and cultured under 5% CO2. Cell aliquots of WT and M2 were collected for RNA isolation after being transferred to the fresh medium conditions for 12h and 24h. Three biological replicates were randomly selected to prepare mRNA-Seq library. In total， 12 samples collected at two time points (12h and 24h) were used for mRNA-Seq library preparation and then submitted to Illumina HiSeq 2000 for sequencing.Please note that [1] each FPKM.txt processed data file contains 3 data columns (one for each replicate) and is linked to the corresponding 'replicate1' sample records， [2] the M2_WT_*FPKM.txt files contain the merged data of each sample group for the indicated time point and are linked as Series supplementary files.,30904735,Metab Eng
Tailoring the resolution of single-cell RNA sequencing for primary cytotoxic T cells,GSE163089,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Single-cell RNA sequencing in principle offers unique opportunities to improve the efficacy of contemporary T-cell based immunotherapy against cancer. The use of high-quality single-cell data will aid our incomplete understanding of molecular programs determining the differentiation and functional heterogeneity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)  allowing for optimal therapeutic design. So far  a major obstacle to high depth single-cell analysis of CTLs is the minute amount of RNA available  leading to low capturing efficacy. To overcome this  we tailor a droplet-based approach for high-throughput analysis (tDrop-seq) and a plate-based method for high-performance in-depth CTL analysis (tSCRB-seq). The latter gives  on average  a 15-fold higher number of captured transcripts per gene compared to droplet-based technologies. The improved dynamic range of gene detection gives tSCRB-seq an edge in resolution sensitive downstream applications such as graded high confidence gene expression measurements and cluster characterization. We demonstrate the power of tSCRB-seq by revealing the subpopulation-specific expression of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptor targets of key importance for immunotherapy.,This study groups a total of 27 samples of single-cell RNA sequencing with two different protocols (Drop-seq and SCRB-seq) and their modifications.,33495472,Nat Commun
U1 snRNP regulates chromatin retention of noncoding RNAs,GSE134287,Mus musculus,Pervasive transcription in the mammalian genome produces thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and promoter- or enhancer-associated unstable transcripts. They preferentially locate to chromatin， at which some regulate chromatin structure， transcription and RNA processing. While several RNA sequences responsible for nuclear localization have been identified， such as repeats in the lncRNA Xist and Alu-like elements for long RNAs， how lncRNAs as a class are enriched on chromatin remains elusive. To screen for cis-elements that contribute to RNA-chromatin localization， we developed a high-throughput method named RNA elements for subcellular localization by sequencing (REL-seq)， and discovered a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-recognition motif being critical for chromatin localization of reporter RNAs. Across the genome， chromatin-bound lncRNAs， which are enriched with 5â splice sites and depleted of 3â splice sites， exhibit high levels of U1 snRNA binding compared to cytoplasm-localized protein-coding mRNAs. Acute depletion of U1 snRNA， or U1 snRNP protein component SNRNP70， drastically reduces the chromatin association of hundreds of lncRNAs and unstable transcripts without altering the overall transcription rate in cells. In addition， rapid degradation of SNRNP70 reduces the localization of both nascent and polyadenylated lncRNA transcripts to chromatin， and disrupts the nuclear-speckles and genome-wide localization of Malat1， a highly conserved and abundant lncRNA. Moreover， chromatin-bound U1 snRNP interacts with transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Together， these results demonstrate that U1 snRNP acts widely to tether and mobilize lncRNAs to chromatin in a Pol II transcription-dependent manner. Our findings uncover a novel role of U1 snRNP beyond pre-mRNA processing and provide molecular insights into how lncRNAs are recruited to Pol II-transcribed genes and have a propensity for chromatin-associated functions.,All RNA-seq were used to identify the subcellular localization changes of lncRNAs upon U1 AMO inhibtion or SNRNP70AID degradation. Total RNA-seq identifies both nascent and mature RNAs; polyA RNA-seq mainly identifies mature RNAs; SLAM-seq was used to discriminate newly-synthesized polyA RNA after SNRNP70AID degradation from pre-existed RNAs. All ChIP-seq and TT-seq were used to chracterize the changes of Ser5 or Ser2 phosphorylated Pol II occupancy and transcription rate upon SNRNP70 acute degradation. All ChIRP-seq were used to characterize the changes of Malat1 genome-wide targeting upon SNRNP70 acute depletion or transcription inhibition.,32238924,Nature

BMP signaling: at the gate between activated melanocyte stem cells and differentiation [RNA-Seq],GSE147295,Mus musculus,Adult tissue stem cells protect their long-term potential by exerting precise control over their transitions between quiescence， activation， and differentiation. Through cyclic bouts synchronous with the hair cycle， quiescent melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) become activated to generate proliferative progeny that differentiate to produce and transfer pigment to hair cells.Â Â The signaling factors orchestrating this process are still poorly understood. Here， we use single cell RNA-sequencing with pseudotime analysis to elucidate the transcriptional trajectory of McSCs through quiescence， activation， and differentiation into mature melanocytes. Unearthing signs of increased WNT and BMP signaling along this progression， we lineage-ablate either pathway and see hair graying.Â Â We show that BMP signaling functions downstream of McSCs but upstream of WNT signaling through LEF1. After stem cell activation， the two pathways triggerÂ committed， proliferative progeny to fuel MITF-dependent differentiation. Analyses of the promoters required for melanosome maturation suggest a specific reliance upon MITF and LEF1 transcription factors， whichÂ Â we show are dampened without BMP signaling. Our findings shed light upon the signaling interplay that orchestrates the melanocyte lineage. Moreover， the block in differentiation and enhanced proliferation observed in the absence of BMP signaling raises the disconcerting possibility that BMP may harbor not only tumor promoting but also tumor suppressing activity in melanoma.,RNA-sequencing was performed on FACS-sorted second telogen (~P60) quiescent melanocyte stem cells (2 biological replicates) and full anagen (P10) melanocytes (3 biological replicates). Cells were FACS purified into TRI Reagent LS， and total RNA was purified using the Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research) according to the kit protocol.  RNA quality was determined by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer， and cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TrueSeq mRNA sample preparation kit (non-stranded， poly-A selection) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument.,33184221,Genes Dev

Epithelial cells in 2D and 3D culture exhibit significant differences in long-range genomic interactions [RNA-Seq],GSE136173,Mus musculus,Recent studies have characterized the genomic structures of many eukaryotic cells， often with a focus on their relation to gene expression. So far， these studies have largely only investigated cells grown in 2D culture， although the transcriptomes of 3D cultured cells are generally closer to their in vivo phenotype. To examine the effects of spatial constraints on chromosome conformation， we investigated the genomic architecture of mouse hepatocytes grown in 2D and 3D cultures using in situ Hi-C. Our results reveal significant differences in long-range genomic interactions， notably in compartment identity and strength as well as in TAD-TAD interactions， but only minor differences at the TAD level. RNA-seq analysis reveals an up-regulation in the 3D cultured cells of those genes involved in physiological hepatocyte functions. We find that these genes are associated with only a subset of the structural changes， suggesting that the differences in genomic structure are indeed critically important for transcriptional regulation but also that there are major structural differences owing to other functions than gene expression. Overall， our results indicate that growth in 3D significantly alters longer-range genomic interactions， which may be consequential for a subset of genes that are important for the physiological functioning of the cell.,The genome-wide interactome were generated using in-situ Hi-C method in both ltwo-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultured AML12 cells which were arrest at G1/S,33631432,Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics
Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of freshly resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tissues,GSE148466,Homo sapiens,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths world-wide. ~85% of lung carcinomas are nonâsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Tumor cell heterogeneity is very poorly defined. However， it is known to be important for tumor response to cancer therapy and cancer agressivenes. We subjected three NSCLC tumors resected from different patients to Drop-seq in order to 1) elucidate the capability of scRNA-seq analysis in identifying different tumor cell populations; and 2) ascertain the clinical value of the genes which distinguish cancer cells from other cells in the tissue. As anticipated， the tissue composition of independently collected samples varied. Despite deficient populations in some samples， both donor and patient samples contributed to the majority of cell populations. However， cancer cells were all patient-specific. These findings emphasize the utility of single cell gene expression data in identification of tumor cell populations. The collected data might be further used for predicting of drugs specific to the biology of activated pathways and patient outcome.,Examining NSCLC tumor cell populations using single cell RNA-seq,33712615,Nat Commun
Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide [ChIP-Seq],GSE163623,Homo sapiens,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic， caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)， has rapidly become a global public health threat due to the lack of effective drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs， a second second-generation antiandrogen agent， enzalutamide， was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)， a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells， in prostate cancer cells. However， definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here， we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells， lung cancer cells， human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cells， however， such antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide was lacking in human lung cells and organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice， Accordingly， enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR-independent TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover， we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells. Thus， our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19 through reducing TMPRSS2 expression in lung cells.,AR-ChIP-seq was performed in AR-positive lung cancer cells A549， H2126 and H1437 and prostate cancer cells LNCaP,33558541,Nat Commun
Quantifying the effect of experimental perturbations in single-cell3RNA-sequencing data using graph signal processing,GSE161465,Homo sapiens,Current methods for quantification of differences between scRNA-seq datasets collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space such as clusters of cells. Here， we describe a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across the transcriptomic space with single cell resolution. We describe the cellular state space as manifold， use a heat filter to estimate the density of each sample over the manifold， and normalize these densities to obtain the relative likelihood of observing each cell in each of the observed conditions. We develop vertex frequency clustering to identify populations of affected cells at the appropriate level of granularity.

Quantifying the effect of experimental perturbations in single-cell3RNA-sequencing data using graph signal processing,GSE161465,Homo sapiens,Current methods for quantification of differences between scRNA-seq datasets collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space such as clusters of cells. Here， we describe a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across the transcriptomic space with single cell resolution. We describe the cellular state space as manifold， use a heat filter to estimate the density of each sample over the manifold， and normalize these densities to obtain the relative likelihood of observing each cell in each of the observed conditions.

Inflation-collapse dynamics drive patterning and morphogenesis in intestinal organoids,GSE164638,Mus musculus,We apply single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to murine intestinal organoids in two experiments: 1) Comparing the transcriptomic landscape of organoids cultured in dome and sandwich culture systems (as described in the accompanying paper for this GEO submission)， and 2) Assessing the transcriptomic landscape of organoids perturbed with CFTRinh-172 to inhibit inflation events， and with Forskolin to activate inflation events in the sandwich culture system， with respective controls. We find that the dome and sandwich culture systems produce similar abundance levels of each major specialized cell type， with similar marker gene expression shared across culture types. We find in the perturbation experiments a stretch-responsive cell state， similar in gene expression to several previously reported cell states， which is significantly more abundant in the Forskolin treated organoids compared to controls， and significantly less abundant in CFTRinh-172 treated organoids compared to controls. Additionally， we find that Stem and Enterocyte cell states are respectively， significantly less abundant， and more abundant in the Forskolin treated organoids compared to controls.,Examination of transcriptomic landscapes of two murine intestinal organoid culture types: dome and sandwich culture systems; examination of transcriptomic landscape changes in murine intestinal organoids as a result of inflation perturbations.,nan,

ChIP-nexus data for Oct4， Sox2， Nanog and Klf4 in mouse embryonic stem cells,GSE137193,Mus musculus,The goal of this study was discover the transcription binding synthax for the key differentiation TFs in mouse embryonic stem cells.Genes are regulated through enhancer sequences， in which transcription factor binding motifs and their specific arrangements (syntax) form a cis-regulatory code. To understand the relationship between motif syntax and transcription factor binding， we train a deep learning model that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution binding profiles of four pluripotency transcription factors Oct4， Sox2， Nanog， and Klf4. We interpret the model to accurately map hundreds of thousands of motifs in the genome， learn novel motif representations and identify rules by which motifs and syntax influence transcription factor binding. We find that instances of strict motif spacing are largely due to retrotransposons， but that soft motif syntax influences motif interactions at protein and nucleosome range. Most strikingly， Nanog binding is driven by motifs with a strong preference for ~10.5 bp spacings corresponding to helical periodicity. Interpreting deep learning models applied to high-resolution binding data is a powerful and versatile approach to uncover the motifs and syntax of cis-regulatory sequences.,ChIP-nexus and ChIP-seq measurements in WT ESCs R1 cell line for 4 TFs.

SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in human fetal and pediatric gastric organoids,GSE153684,Homo sapiens,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global public health emergency. COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast， fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19， although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover， it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses， and from pediatric biopsies， to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages， and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen， somatostatin， gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions， we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity， the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2， where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death， while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2， compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively， we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages， and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection， especially in early stages of development. However， the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients， suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.,Transcriptomic analysis of organoids derived from fetal and pediatric gastric samples infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI 1， and paired negative controls.,34785679,Nat Commun
"Transcriptome profiling of human lung cancer cell lines with synthetic ""sequin"" controls",GSE164598,Homo sapiens,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to build up a transcriptomic data analysis pipeline and test its performance using synthetic ""sequins"" controls and lung cancer cell lines.Methods - Cell Culture: Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H1975 and HCC827 from a range of passages (2-4) were grown on 3 separate occasions in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.Methods - RNA preparation: Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent. 6 ng of sequins were added to 1 ug of total RNA (mix  A with H1975， mix B withÂ HCC827).Methods - Library prep: the sequin+total RNA mixtures were subjected to polyA selection (NEBNext PolyA E7490) and library prep (NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions; we performed 9Â PCR cycles",Total RNA was extracted from lung adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H1975 and HCC827 (2 independent samples for each cell line). Both mRNA and Total RNA transcriptomes from these samples were profiled by RNA-Seq (Illumina short-read， Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION and PacBio Sequel II)The processed data are the raw counts of all Sequin genes. Although there are some reads from human cell lines in this dataset， by mapping all of the reads to the Sequin decoy chromosome， we can get a mapping rate around 80%， and we only analysed the Sequins genes in our study.,33937765,NAR Genom Bioinform
Systematic comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods for immune cell profiling [10x],GSE163781,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines， simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes.  We evaluate methods by their cell recovery rate， library efficiency， sensitivity， and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type.  We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5â v1 and 3â v3 methods.  We demonstrate that these methods have fewer drop-out events which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.,Various single-cell RNA-seq methods used to generate libraries using a 1:1:1:1 mixture of four lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat， TALL-104， EL4， IVA12).,33472597,BMC Genomics
BMP signaling: at the gate between activated melanocyte stem cells and differentiation [SMART-Seq2 single cell RNA-seq],GSE147298,Mus musculus,Adult tissue stem cells protect their long-term potential by exerting precise control over their transitions between quiescence， activation， and differentiation. Through cyclic bouts synchronous with the hair cycle， quiescent melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) become activated to generate proliferative progeny that differentiate to produce and transfer pigment to hair cells.Â Â The signaling factors orchestrating this process are still poorly understood. Here， we use single cell RNA-sequencing with pseudotime analysis to elucidate the transcriptional trajectory of McSCs through quiescence， activation， and differentiation into mature melanocytes. Unearthing signs of increased WNT and BMP signaling along this progression， we lineage-ablate either pathway and see hair graying.Â Â We show that BMP signaling functions downstream of McSCs but upstream of WNT signaling through LEF1. After stem cell activation， the two pathways triggerÂ committed， proliferative progeny to fuel MITF-dependent differentiation. Analyses of the promoters required for melanosome maturation suggest a specific reliance upon MITF and LEF1 transcription factors， whichÂ Â we show are dampened without BMP signaling. Our findings shed light upon the signaling interplay that orchestrates the melanocyte lineage. Moreover， the block in differentiation and enhanced proliferation observed in the absence of BMP signaling raises the disconcerting possibility that BMP may harbor not only tumor promoting but also tumor suppressing activity in melanoma.,SMART-Seq2 single cell RNA-sequencing (totalling 1804 cells) of wild type mouse quiescent melanocyte stem cells (3 biological replicates)， wild type mouse activated melanocyte stem cells (3 biological replicates)， wild type differentiated melanocytes (2 biological replicates)， as well as stage matched Bmpr1a wild type committed melanocyte progenitors (1 biological replicate)， Bmpr1a heterozygous committed melanocyte progenitors (2 biological replicates)， and Bmpr1a conditional knockout committed melanocyte progenitors (2 biological replicates),33184221,Genes Dev

Evaluating Capture Sequence Performance for Single-cell CRISPR-activation Experiments,GSE164393,Homo sapiens,The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing with CRISPR inhibition/activation provides a high-throughput approach to simultaneously study the effects of hundreds if not thousands of gene perturbations in a single experiment. One recent development in CRISPR-based single-cell techniques introduces a feature barcoding technology which allows for the simultaneous capture of mRNA and gRNA from the same cell. This is achieved by introducing a capture sequence， whose complement can be incorporated into each gRNA， and which can be used to amplify these features prior to sequencing. However， with the technology in its infancy， there is little information available on how such experimental parameters can be optimised. To overcome this， we varied the capture sequence， capture sequence position and gRNA backbone to identify an optimal gRNA scaffold for CRISPR-activation gene perturbation studies. We provide a report on our screening approach along with our observations and recommendations for future use.,single cell RNA sequencing of hESC overexpressing either ASCL1 or SOX17 via CRISPR activation， cells are collected 3 days， 5 days and 7 days after introduction of gRNA and pooled into a single single-cell library， which is the sequenced for gene expression and CRISPR gRNA capture,33625849,ACS Synth Biol
Molecular profiling of stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cell differentiation established for clinical translation,GSE164092,Homo sapiens;Oryctolagus cuniculus,Human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hESC-RPE) are a promising cell source to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Despite several ongoing clinical studies， a detailed mapping of transient cellular states during in vitro differentiation has not been performed. Here we conduct single-cell transcriptomic profiling of a hESC-RPE differentiation protocol that has been developed for clinical use. Differentiation progressed through a culture diversification recapitulating early embryonic development， in which cells rapidly acquired a rostral embryo patterning signature， before converging towards the RPE lineage. At intermediate steps， we identified and examined the potency of a NCAM1+ retinal progenitor population and showed the ability of the protocol to suppress non-RPE fates. We demonstrated that the method produces a pure RPE pool capable of maturing further after subretinal transplantation in a large-eyed animal model. Our evaluation of hESC-RPE differentiation supports the development of safe and efficient pluripotent stem cell-based therapies for AMD.,hESC lines HS980 and KARO1 were previously derived and cultured under xeno-free and defined conditions (Rodin et al. 2014). Donors gave their informed consent for the derivation and subsequent use of hESC lines (Swedish Ethical Review Authority: 2011/745:31/3). The hESC line E1C3 (NN GMP0050E1C3) was provided as a research cell bank of the clinical GMP cell line by NovoNordisk (UCSF IRB:1518222， for RPE differentiation Projekt-ID: H-18016740， Anmeldelsesnr.: 73105). All hESCs maintain a normal karyotype and trilineage differentiation potential， and they are routinely tested for mycoplasma. Cells were maintained by clonal propagation on hrLN-521-coated plates and on iMatrix-511 for the E1C3 line (0.25 Î¼g/cm2， Nippi， T303) in NutriStem hPSC XF medium (Biological Industries) and a 5% CO2/5% O2 incubator.All cells were transported at 4Â°C to the Eukaryotic Single Cell Genomics Facility (ESCG， SciLifeLab， Stockholm， Sweden) where a 3â cDNA library was prepared for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the 10X Genomics platform and NovaSeq 6000 software. Cell Ranger 2.1.1 was used to convert Illumina base call files to FASTQ format. Cell Ranger 3.1.0 was used to map FASTQ sequencing reads to the human GRCh38 reference transcriptome with the STAR aligner and to generate feature-barcode count matrices.A step-by-step protocol describing the differentiation procedure has been reported previously (doi 10.1038/s41467-020-15326-5 and doi 10.21203/rs.3.pex-635/v1). hESCs were plated at a cell density of 2.4x104 cells/cm2 on hrLN-521 (20 Î¼g/mL) using NutriStem hPSC XF medium. A Rho-kinase inhibitor (Millipore， Y-27632) at a concentration of 10 Î¼M was added during the first 24h， while cells were kept at 37Â°C， 5% CO2/5% O2. After 24h， hPSC medium was replaced with differentiation medium NutriStem hPSC XF without bFGF and TGFÎ² and cells were placed at 37Â°C， 5% CO2/21%O2. From day 6 after plating， 100 ng/mL of Activin A was added to the media. Cells were fed three times a week and kept for 30 days. Monolayers were then trypsinized using TrypLE Select for 10 min at 37Â°C， 5% CO2. The enzyme was carefully removed and the cells were collected in fresh pre-warmed NutriStem hPSC XF medium without bFGF and TGFÎ² by gentle pipetting to obtain a single cell suspension. Cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 4 min， the pellet was resuspended， passed through a cell strainer and seeded on laminin coated dishes at different cell densities ranging from 1.4x106 to 1.4x104 cells/cm2. Replated cells were fed three times a week during the subsequent 30 days with NutriStem hPSC XF medium without bFGF and TGFÎ². Single cell RNA-sequencing was performed on undifferentiated hESCs and at days 7， 14， 30， 38， 45， and 60 of this protocol.hESC-RPE monolayers were washed with DPBS， incubated with TrypLE and dissociated to single cell suspension as described above. Cells were counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer chamber using 0.4% trypan blue， centrifuged at 300g for 4 min， and the cell pellet was resuspended in freshly filter-sterilized DPBS to a final concentration of 1000 cells/Î¼L. The cell suspension was then aseptically aliquoted into 600 Î¼L units and kept on ice until surgery.After approval by the Northern Stockholm Animal Experimental Ethics Committee (DNR N56/15)， two female New Zealand white albino rabbits aged 5 months and weighing 3.5 to 4.0 kg were used in this study. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.Animals were put under general anesthesia by intramuscular administration of 35 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine， and the pupils were dilated with a mix of 0.75% cyclopentolate / 2.5% phenylephrine. Microsurgeries were performed on both eyes using a 2-port 25G transvitreal pars plana technique. 25G trocars were inserted 1 mm from the limbus and an infusion cannula was connected to the lower temporal trocar. The cell suspension was drawn into a 1 mL syringe connected to an extension tube and a 38G polytip cannula. Without infusion or prior vitrectomy the cannula was inserted through the upper temporal trocar. After proper tip positioning， ascertained by a focal whitening of the retina， 50 Î¼L of hESC-RPE cell suspension (equivalent to 50，000 cells) was injected slowly subretinally， approximately 6 mm below the inferior margin of the optic nerve head， forming a uniform bleb that was clearly visible under the operating microscopeHuman post-mortem research-consented donor eyes were obtained from the cornea bank at St. Erik Eye Hospital， Stockholm， Sweden. The use of human tissue was in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Swedish legislative and ethical committee (#2019-02032) for the use of human donor material for research. Donors did not present any clinical diagnosis of ocular disease， and samples were anonymized and processed under the general data protection regulation. Two human eyes from the same donor were used (45-year-old male， 32 hours post-mortem). The lens was dissected out and the rest of the retina， except the sclera， was chopped in several small pieces mixed together in 500 uL of digestion buffer (described below). Two embryonic eyes from the same embryo were used from a 7.5 post-conception week embryo (Table S1). The optic cups were dissected out and chopped in several small pieces to facilitate dissociation in 500 uL of digestion buffer (described below). Donors (deceased， family for adult human eyes， or couples for the embryos) gave their informed consent for the donation and subsequent use for research purposes. The embryonic eyes were acquired from a clinical routine abortion after informed consent by the pregnant woman， in accordance with permissions from the regional ethical review board and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (âSocialstyrelsenâ #8.1-11692/2019) and the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (âEPNâ #2007/1477-31/3).Two rabbit eyes (from different animals) with 30-day integrated hESC-RPE were enucleated and pigmented areas including neuroretina， choroid and RPE layer was dissected out， trimmed and mixed together in 500 uL of digestion buffer. Eppendorfs containing the samples were rotated and incubated at 37Â°C on a thermocycler at 300g for 25 min until samples were homogenized. Samples were pipetted every 5 min to digest the tissue sample into single cells. Digestion was stopped by adding equivalent volume of 10% embryonic bovine serum in PBS， the samples were filtered using a 30Âµm MACS Smart Strainer followed by Dead Cell Removal kit to remove dead cells and debris. At this stage， one of the rabbit eye cell samples was stained with mouse anti-human HLA-ABC-FITC， and anti-human HLA-ABC-positive cells were FACS-sorted as specified above， collected and resuspended to 1000 cells/uL in 1% BSA in PBS for further scRNA-sequencing.

BMP signaling: at the gate between activated melanocyte stem cells and differentiation [ATAC-seq],GSE159193,Mus musculus,Through recurrent bouts synchronous with the hair cycle， quiescent melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) become activated to generate proliferative progeny that differentiate into pigment-producing melanocytes. The signaling factors orchestrating these events remain incompletely understood. Here， we use single cell RNA-sequencing with comparative gene expression analysis to elucidate the transcriptional dynamics of McSCs through quiescence， activation， and melanocyte maturation. Unearthing signs of increased WNT and BMP signaling along this progression， we endeavored to understand how these pathways are integrated during differentiation. Employing conditional lineage-specific genetic ablation studies in mice， we find that loss of BMP signaling in the lineage leads to hair graying due to a block in melanocyte maturation.  We show that interestingly， BMP signaling functions downstream of activated McSCs and maintains WNT effector， transcription factor LEF1. Employing pseudotime analysis， genetics， and promoter analyses， and chromatin landscaping， we show that following WNT-mediated activation of McSCs， BMP and WNT pathways collaborate to trigger the commitment of proliferative progeny by fueling LEF1 and MITF-dependent differentiation. Our findings shed light upon the signaling interplay and timing of cues that orchestrate melanocyte lineage progression in the hair follicle and underscore a key role for BMP signaling in driving complete differentiation.,For ATAC-sequencing， cells were FACS purified using an 85 uM nozzle. qMcSCs (p60-80) were isolated as described in Fig. S2A; differentiating progeny were isolated form Dct-eGFP+ anagen skin at P9 (Dump-， Sca-1-， CD34-， eGFPhigh， CD117+ cells). Library preparation was performed as described (Buenrostro et al.， 2013) with some modifications. After sorting， cells were washed with 1X PBS， pelleted， and resuspended in cold lysis buffer  (10 mM Tris-HCl， pH 7.4， 10 mM NaCl， 3 mM MgCl2， 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). Lysis buffer was removed by centrifugation， and samples were incubated in the transposition reaction at 37C for 30 minutes (Illumina Nextera DNA Preparation Kit; TDE1 enzyme， 10uL). The reaction was terminated by addition of Tagmentaion Clean Up buffer (300 mM EDTA， 900 mM NaCl) and purified with the Qiagen MiniElue PCR purification kit. The DNA was then PCR amplified for 12-18 cycles， and the products were tested by D1000 Tape Station (Agilent) at 3 cycling conditions. Optimal samples were then pooled and bead purified before sequencing on NextSeq High Output 75 single read (40 x 40 bp paired end).,33184221,Genes Dev
Kdm5b depletion in embryonic stem cells does not induce intragenic promoters or affect transcription [HELP-tagging],GSE63434,Mus musculus,The application of massively-parallel sequencing (MPS) technology to understanding how the genome is regulated is of major importance， as we now appreciate sequence variants associated with common heritable diseases to be enriched at regulatory elements in the genome.  There is， however， an enormous challenge inherent to these studies， which are much more varied as assays and in terms of analytical approaches than the approaches Â used to define the sequence variants themselves.  For example， there areis a plethora of assays that test 5-methylcytosine genome-wide， numerous different analytical approaches to defineing peaks from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)， and increasingly diverse aspects of genomic regulation being studied.  The extremely large data sets generated do not lend themselves to distribution without some degree of pre-processing， and the hardware requirements for running these analyses are often substantial.  We have highlighted these concerns previously， but the central concern for our field is that genomics research is especially prone to poor reproducibility， and is a prime candidate for implementation of measures that could help to address this general problem.To illustrate the practical issues involved in genomics reproducibility， we sought to analyze our and three previoulsy published studies of the histone demethylase KDM5B using the same analytical approaches.,Cytosine methylation profile of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells after knock down of Kdm5b,nan,
Ribosomes act as cryosensors in plants,GSE166543,Arabidopsis thaliana,Cold temperatures are a threat to temperate plants， and Arabidopsis thaliana has acquired an adaptive gene expression network controlled by CBF transcription factors. The CBFs are sufficient to enable plants to survive otherwise lethal subzero temperatures. Constitutive CBF expression causes delayed flowering and stunted growth， and plants have evolved the ability to restrict CBF expression to occur only in the cold. This allows plants to anticipate likely freezing events and selectively deploy cold tolerance. The mechanism by which cold stress is sensed is however unknown. Here we show that protein translation rates in plants are proportional to temperature， and reduced translation rates trigger a rise in intracellular free calcium that activates the CAMTA transcription factors， and these directly activate cold-induced gene expression.,Single samples were taken at each time point. RNA-Seqs and ChIP-Seqs were performed for different genotypes at different temperature and objective time.,nan,
Assessing efficiency of single cell population by Drop-seq using cell mixture of epithelial and myeloid cells.,GSE134842,Homo sapiens,A lung epithelial cell line was mixed with monocytes/marcophages， and then cells were separated using specific antibodies and/or Drop-seq. PC9 is a non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line. Myeloid lineage cell line U937 are known to differentiate along monocyte/marcophage lineage by TPA. Using Drop-seq， we were able to clearly distinguish PC9 from U937 cells in the mixture. The separation by Drop-seq was correlated with the separation by cell type-specific antibodies. We were able to identify specific biomarkers， as preferentially expressed genes， for each cell population. The results of our study addresses the quality of cell separation by Drop-seq.,efficincy of cell separation using single cell RNA-seq,33712615,Nat Commun

Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of freshly resected PC9 cell line-derived tumor xenografts,GSE160244,Homo sapiens,The non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) PC9 cell line is an established preclinical model for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using PC9 cells， we generated EGFR-mutant lung cancer xenografts to study the differences in response between individual cells and cell populations. We performed treatment of PC9 xenograft tumors with the combination of osimertinib and crizotinib as well as single drugs， followed by Drop-seq. The addition of crizotinib was guided by our previous data in PC9 grown in cell culture that identified an erlotinib-resistant drug population sensitive to crizotinib. The results of the xenograft study show that combination treatment targets specific osimertinib-tolerant cell populations but leaves a subset of the population that is tolerant to the combo. Each cell subpopulation is characterized by specific molecular signatures. The results of our study help to address emerging drug resistance that limits clinical usefulness of targeted strategies， particularly in NSCLC.,examining drug resistant cell populations using single cell RNA-seq,33712615,Nat Commun

In vivo Perturb-Seq reveals neuronal and glial abnormalities associated with autism risk genes,GSE157977,Mus musculus,We developed and applied a scalable genetic screening approach， in vivo Perturb-Seq， to functionally evaluate 35 autism spectrum disorder/neurodevelopmental delay (ASD/ND) de novo loss-of-function risk genes (seehttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/791525v1for complete list). Using CRISPR-Cas9， we introduced frameshift mutations in these risk genes in pools， within the developing mouse brain in utero， followed by single-cell RNA sequencing of perturbed cells in the postnatal brain. We identified cell type-specific and evolutionarily conserved gene modules from both neuronal and glial cell classes. Recurrent gene modules and cell types are affected across this cohort of perturbations， representing key cellular effects across sets of ASD/ND risk genes.,All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Harvard University and of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. In utero lentiviral injection into the lateral ventricles was performed at E12.5 in Cas9 transgenic mice (4-6 month old， Jax #026179)， and each single-cell library was made by combining the BFP+ cells from 1-3 litters (4-20 animals) of P7 animals harvested on the same day. The FACS-purified cells were sorted into cold Hibernate A/B27 medium and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing library preparation. Our analysis comprises 18 independent libraries of Perturb-Seq cells (17 after filtering). Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were created using the Chromium Single Cell 3' Solution v2 kit (10x Genomics) following the manufacturerâs protocol. Each library was sequenced with Illumina NextSeq high-output 75-cycle kit with sequencing saturation above 70%. Dial-out PCR was performed to extract the perturbation barcode in each cell.,33243861,Science
Acute TNF-induced repression of cell identity genes is mediated by NFkB-directed redistribution of cofactors from super-enhancers,GSE64233,Homo sapiens,The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a central role in low-grade adipose tissue inflammation and development of insulin resistance during obesity. In this context， nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB)， is directly involved and required for the acute activation of the inflammatory gene program. Here we show that the major transactivating subunit of NF?B， v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA)， is also required for acute TNF-induced suppression of adipocyte genes. Notably， this repression does not involve RELA binding to the associated enhancers but rather loss of cofactors and enhancer RNA (eRNA) selectively from high occupancy sites within super-enhancers. Based on these data we have developed models that with high accuracy predict which enhancers and genes are repressed by TNF in adipocytes. We show that these models are applicable to other cell types where TNF represses genes associated with super-enhancers in a highly cell type-specific manner. Our results propose a novel paradigm for NF?B-mediated repression， whereby NF?B selectively redistributes cofactors from high occupancy enhancers， thereby specifically repressing super-enhancer-associated cell identity genes.,Genome-wide assesment of the acute transcriptional response to TNF in human SGBS adipocytes using RNA- ChIP- and DHS-seq.

HoxB genes regulate neuronal delamination in the trunk neural tube by controlling the expression of Lzts1,GSE162665,Gallus gallus,Differential Hox gene expression is central for specification of axial neuronal diversity in the spinal cord. Here， we uncover an additional function of Hox proteins in the developing spinal cord， restricted to B cluster Hox genes. We found that members of the HoxB cluster are expressed in the trunk neural tube of chicken embryo earlier than Hox from the other clusters， with poor antero-posterior axial specificity and with overlapping expression in the intermediate zone (IZ). Gain-of-function experiments of HoxB4， HoxB8 and HoxB9， respectively representative of anterior， central， and posterior HoxB genes， resulted in ectopic progenitor cells in the mantle zone. The search for HoxB8 downstream targets in the early neural tube identified the Leucine Zipper Tumor Suppressor 1 gene (Lzts1)， which expression is also activated by HoxB4 and HoxB9. Gain and loss of function experiments showed that Lzts1， expressed endogenously in the IZ， controls neuronal delamination. These data collectively indicate that HoxB genes have a generic function in the developing spinal cord， controlling the expression of Lzts1 and neuronal delamination.,Neural tube in ovo electroporations were performed at HH11.

Systematic comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods for immune cell profiling [ddSEQ],GSE163788,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines， simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes.  We evaluate methods by their cell recovery rate， library efficiency， sensitivity， and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type.  We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5â v1 and 3â v3 methods.  We demonstrate that these methods have fewer drop-out events which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.,Various single-cell RNA-seq methods used to generate libraries using a 1:1:1:1 mixture of four lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat， TALL-104， EL4， IVA12).,33472597,BMC Genomics
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) deficiency enhances intramembranous osteogenesis following stress fracture in mice,GSE157460,Mus musculus,Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is highly upregulated in response to skeletal injury， suggesting it plays a role in the inflammatory phase of fracture repair. However， the impact of IL-6 on successful repair remains incompletely defined. Therefore， we investigated IL-6 in fracture repair using 12-week old IL-6 global knockout mice (IL-6 KO) and two models of fracture repair: full fracture and stress fracture. Callus formation 14 days after full fracture did not differ between IL-6 knockout mice and controls. However， IL-6 KO mice had an enhanced response 7 days after stress fracture compared to control， with increased callus (p=0.020) and bone formation (p=0.045). IL-6 KO did not alter the recruitment of neutrophils or macrophages to the stress fracture callus. IL-6 KO also did not alter the number of osteoclasts in the stress fracture callus. Based on RNA-seq， IL-6 KO resulted in only modest alterations to the gene expression at early time points after stress fracture. Wnt1 was more highly upregulated in IL-6 KO callus at both day 1 (fold change 12.5 vs. 5.7) and day 3 (fold change 4.7 vs. 1.9) compared to controls. Finally， using tibial compression to induce bone formation， we found that IL-6 KO directly impacted osteoblast function， increasing the propensity for woven bone formation. Herein， we report that IL-6 knockout enhanced formation of callus and bone following stress fracture injury， likely through direct action on the osteoblastâs ability to produce woven bone. This suggests a novel role of IL-6 as a suppressor of intramembranous bone formation.,36 samples， 12 non-loaded/intact control ulnae from IL6 WT (n=6) and IL6 KO (n=6). 12 samples from a stress fracture ulna at day 1 (24h) after injury from IL6 WT (n=6) and IL6 KO (n=6). 12 samples from stress fracture ulnae at day 3 (72h) after injury from IL6 WT (n=6 and IL6 KO (n=6) mice.

p53 is a central regulator driving neurodegeneration caused by C9orf72 poly(PR),GSE162048,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,To analyze the epigenomic landscape of neurodegeneration caused by ALS-associated protein aggregation， we developed a modified version of ATAC-seq that works on primary neurons. We discovered that C9orf72-ALS/FTD associated poly(PR) activated a remarkably specific signature of chromatin accessibility， involving transcriptional targets of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of p53 as a mediator of neurodegeneration elicited by poly(PR) and provide an example of how ATAC-seq can now be applied to neurons to define mechanisms of neurodegeneration.,RNA and DNA were isolated from primary neurons treated for 20， 40 and 60h with either GFP， (PR)50， TDP-43 or untreated. Neurons were grown on 12 well plates each with 450，000 neurons and for each condition 4 biological replicates were pooled together and then split into 2 groups. To obtain RNA from the same neurons that were used for ATAC-seq， we performed sequential lysis. Neurons were first lysed in ATAC-seq resuspension RSB buffer， followed by sequential RNA extraction and isolation in RLT buffer of the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN)， according to the manufacturerâs protocol. In brief， cells were lysed， homogenized， and loaded on a genomic DNA (gDNA) eliminator column. After removal of genomic DNA， RNA was purified using RNeasy spin columns. RNA quantity and purity were determined by optical density measurements of OD260/280 â¯and OD230/260 â¯using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Structural integrity of the total RNA was assessed using a 2200 TapeStation Instrument with RNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). mRNA libraries were prepared using a SureSelect Strand-Specific RNA Library Preparation kit for Illumina (G9691B) on an Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform， following the manufacturerâs protocol. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. For the ATACseq Primary cortical neurons treated for 20， 40 and 60h with either GFP， (PR)50， TDP-43 or untreated， were pretreated with 200 U/ml DNase (Worthington) for 30 min at 37Â°C to remove free-floating DNA and to digest DNA from dead cells. This medium was then washed out， and the cells were washed in cold PBS four times. To avoid neuronal cell death that is associated with trypsinization， neurons were directly lysed in 1ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4， 10mM NaCl， and 3mM MgCl2 in water， containing 0.1% NP40， 0.1% Tween-20， and 0.01% digitonin) on ice for 10 min. After lysis cells nuclei were collected and counted， 50，000 viable cells were centrifuged at 500xg for 5 min in a pre-chilled (4Â°C) fixed-angle centrifuge. After centrifugation， supernatant was carefully aspirated， with two pipetting steps; The remaining 100Î¼l of supernatant was carefully aspirated by pipetting with a P200 pipette tip to avoid the cell pellet. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin)， and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 RCF in a pre-chilled (4Â°C) fixed-angle centrifuge. Supernatant was carefully removed with two pipetting steps， as described before， and nuclei were resuspended in 50Î¼l of transposition mix (25Î¼l 2Ã TD buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6， 10 mM MgCl2， 20% Dimethyl Formamide)， 2.5Î¼l transposase (100 nM final)， 16.5Î¼l PBS， 0.5Î¼l 1% digitonin， 0.5Î¼l 10% Tween-20， and 5Î¼l water) by pipetting up and down six times. Transposition reactions were incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1，000 r.p.m. Reactions were cleaned up with Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator columns. The complete eluate underwent PCR， as follows. After initial extension， 5 cycles of pre-amplification using indexed primers (Buenrostro et al.， 2015) and NEB Next High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB) were conducted， before the number of additional cycles was assessed by quantitative PCR using SYBR Green. Typically， 7-9 additional cycles were run. The final library was purified using a MinElute PCR kit (QIAGEN) and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) and a High Sensitivity DNA chip run on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). All libraries were sequenced using 150bp Nextseq High Output Cartridge kits and a Nextseq 500 sequencer (Illumina).,33482083,Cell

p53 is a central regulator driving neurodegeneration caused by C9orf72 poly(PR),GSE162048,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,To analyze the epigenomic landscape of neurodegeneration caused by ALS-associated protein aggregation， we developed a modified version of ATAC-seq that works on primary neurons. We discovered that C9orf72-ALS/FTD associated poly(PR) activated a remarkably specific signature of chromatin accessibility， involving transcriptional targets of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of p53 as a mediator of neurodegeneration elicited by poly(PR) and provide an example of how ATAC-seq can now be applied to neurons to define mechanisms of neurodegeneration.,RNA and DNA were isolated from primary neurons treated for 20， 40 and 60h with either GFP， (PR)50， TDP-43 or untreated. Neurons were grown on 12 well plates each with 450，000 neurons and for each condition 4 biological replicates were pooled together and then split into 2 groups. To obtain RNA from the same neurons that were used for ATAC-seq， we performed sequential lysis. Neurons were first lysed in ATAC-seq resuspension RSB buffer， followed by sequential RNA extraction and isolation in RLT buffer of the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN)， according to the manufacturerâs protocol. In brief， cells were lysed， homogenized， and loaded on a genomic DNA (gDNA) eliminator column. After removal of genomic DNA， RNA was purified using RNeasy spin columns. RNA quantity and purity were determined by optical density measurements of OD260/280 â¯and OD230/260 â¯using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Structural integrity of the total RNA was assessed using a 2200 TapeStation Instrument with RNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). mRNA libraries were prepared using a SureSelect Strand-Specific RNA Library Preparation kit for Illumina (G9691B) on an Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform， following the manufacturerâs protocol.

For the ATACseq Primary cortical neurons treated for 20， 40 and 60h with either GFP， (PR)50， TDP-43 or untreated， were pretreated with 200 U/ml DNase (Worthington) for 30 min at 37Â°C to remove free-floating DNA and to digest DNA from dead cells. This medium was then washed out， and the cells were washed in cold PBS four times. To avoid neuronal cell death that is associated with trypsinization， neurons were directly lysed in 1ml of cold ATAC-seq resuspension buffer (RSB; 10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4， 10mM NaCl， and 3mM MgCl2 in water， containing 0.1% NP40， 0.1% Tween-20， and 0.01% digitonin) on ice for 10 min.

Very low protein diets lead to reduced food intake and weight loss， linked to inhibition of hypothalamic mTOR signaling， in mice,GSE158215,Mus musculus,Purpose: To investigate graded levels of low protien dites effects on hypothalamic gene expression pattern， RNA-seq was performed on hypothalamus of mice treated with different levels of low protein and normal protein under both 60% fat and 20% fat conditions. Methods: There were 8 diets in total， the fat content of first 4 diets were fixed at 60% fat level by energy and protein was varied from 1% to 20% (1%， 2.5%， 5% and 20% respectively) by energy (D14121903， D14121904， D14071601，D14071604)， another 4 kinds of diets contained the same graded levels of protein content as the first 4 diets but fat contents were fixed at 20% by energy (D14121905， D14121906， D14071607， D14071610). The remaining energy was compensated of carbohydrate which included corn starch and maltodextrose. Casein was used as the protein source in all diets. To mimic the typical western diet a mix of cocoa butter， menhaden oil， sunflower oil， palm oil and coconut oil was used as the fat source and was designed to generate a 47.5: 36.8: 15.8 proportion of saturated， mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and 14.7: 1 proportion of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids， the proportions of different fat compositions didnât change under two different 60% and 20% fat conditions. Sucrose and cellulose were fixed at 5% level by energy and standard vitamin and mineral mix were also added to all diets as well (Hu et al.， 2018). The two series were isocaloric within each series. Diets can be ordered direct from research diets (https://researchdiets.com) using the diet codes provided. The hypothalamus of 6 individuals were collected for each diet group， 3 of which were pooled together as one sample， resulting in each group having 2 pooled samples of 3 hypothalamus. Hypothalamic RNA was extracted using Trizol method described in star methods in paper and then sent to Beijing Genomic Institute (BGI) for RNA sequencing. All RNA sequencing was measured by using the BGI-seq 500 sequencer. To determine the sequencing quality of each sample， FASTQ raw data files were measured by using fastQC (www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) quality control tool， after confirmed sequencing quality of each sample， raw reads were aligned to the Mus musculus reference genome (GRCm38) using HISAT2-2.1.0 (Kim et al.， 2015; Pertea et al.， 2016) and Samtools-1.2 modules (Li et al.， 2009)， and then featureCounts (Liao et al.， 2014) tool in Subread-5.0 (Liao et al.， 2013) was used to get counts for each sample from BAM files which was obtained from alignment step. To exclude the low counts， only genes with counts per million (CPM) value > 1 were included in the further analysis. Counts were normalized by the trimmed means of M values (TMM normalization) (Robinson and Oshlack， 2010) method in the edgeR (Anders et al.， 2013; Lund et al.， 2012; McCarthy et al.， 2012; Robinson et al.， 2010; Robinson and Oshlack， 2010; Robinson and Smyth， 2007) package. To investigate different dietary protein contents under fixed two levels fat content effects on gene expression levels Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) function in R-3.5.3 edgeR package was used， The GLM model used in this study were: ~P+F+P:F， which means regression against protein (P) and fat contents (F) of diets plus their interaction (P:F). If the interaction effect was not significant (p > 0.05)， the interaction was not included in the analysis and a revised model (~P+F) was utilized (Hu et al.， 2018). To explore significantly correlated genes with dietary protein content respectively under 60% fat and 20% fat conditions， Pearson correlation analysis was performed for normalized log counts of all genes by using Pearson correlation method in R-3.5.3. Then selected the significantly correlated genes with dietary protein content (GLM: p < 0.05) respectively in the GLM and Pearson correlation (Pearson: p < 0.05 for 60% fat and 20% fat conditions) analysis were loaded into the Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) program (Ingenuity Systems;http://www.ingenuity.com/) to observe the significantly affected pathways. Results: The most affected pathways by the dietary low protein included the mTOR signaling pathway， the hunger signaling pathway， eIF2a signaling pathway and regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling pathway. In the hunger signal pathway， we found there were strong correlations for four key hunger signaling pathway genes Pomc， Cart， Npy and Agrp with the protein content in the diet across different protein content groups (from 1% protein to 20% protein group) with Pomc and Cart expression significantly reduced as protein level declined while Npy and Agrp expression increased as protein levels decreased.,There are 8 groups in total， the fat content of first 4 diets were fixed at 60% fat level by energy and protein was varied from 1% to 20% (1%， 2.5%， 5% and 20% respectively) by energy ， another 4 kinds of diets contained the same graded levels of protein content as the first 4 diets but fat contents were fixed at 20% by energy.

Activation of clustered IFNÎ³ target genes drives cohesin-controlled transcriptional memory,GSE150199,Homo sapiens,Cytokine activation of cells induces gene networks involved in inflammation and immunity. Transient gene activation can have a lasting impact even in the absence of ongoing transcription， known as long-term transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment and maintenance of IFNÎ³-induced priming of human cells. We find that while both ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived， the IFNÎ³-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression， correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further， we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration， stochastic nature and molecular mechanisms of IFNÎ³-induced transcriptional memory， relevant to understanding of enhanced innate immune signaling.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual Series,33108759,Mol Cell
Temporal comparison of leaf transcriptomes between early-flowering Arabidopsis thaliana atx1/atx3/atx4 triple mutants and vegetative WT Col-0 plants of the same age.,GSE134177,Arabidopsis thaliana,atx1/atx3/atx4 triple mutants display significantly early flowering and early leaf senescence phenotypes. RNA-seq was used to identify gene expression changes occuring at the time of bolting， independent of leaf age.,"Two homozygous atx1/atx3/atx4 triple T-DNA insertion mutants were isolated (TM1 and TM2). Both have the same T-DNA mutant alleles but come from different crosses so they may contain different background mutations. atx triple mutants display significant early flowering and significant early leaf senescence phenotypes. Previous phenotype analyses show that early leaf senescence was detected at day 33 in the triple mutants. RNA-seq was used to identify gene expression changes occurring at the time of bolting that might be promoting the onset of leaf senescence， thus coupling the early flowering phenotype to the early leaf senescence phenotype (see ""Timeseries Design Infographic""). Triple Mutants bolting at the peak of triple mutant bolting (Days 24 and 25， see ""Peak of Triple Mutant Bolting Info"" for details) were pooled and then 1/4th of these bolting plants were harvested. Plants were then randomly selected for harvesting from this pool in two day increments， three times. Thus， harvesting days were 25， 27， 29， and 31 days after stratification. This strategy was used to ensure the TM plants harvested at each time point were developmentally similar. The sixth leaf to emerge was harvested from each plant. Three replicates were generated per line， per time point (4 time points)， totaling to 12 cDNA libraries per genotype. The 36 cDNA libraries were prepared using the BrAD-seq protocol and were then sequenced at the University of California， Irvine Genome High-throughput Facility.""Peak of Triple Mutant Bolting Info""， ""Timeseries Design Infographic""， ""BrAD-seq Info"".

Homotypic clustering of L1 and B1 repeats organizes 3D genome,GSE123806,Mus musculus,"We postulated that the primary DNA sequences， particularly abundant repetitive elements embedded in the genome， may instruct genome folding. Short and long interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs and LINEs， respectively) are two predominant sub-families of retrotransposons in most mammals. LINE-1 (LINE1 or L1) constitutes the most abundant type of repeat subclasses， making up to 18.8% and 17% (0.9~1.0 million copies) of the genome in mouse and human， respectively. B1 in mouse and its closely related， primate-specific Alu elements in human are the most abundant subclass of SINEs， constituting 2.7%~10% (0.6~1.4 million copies) of mouse and human genomes. Here， we demonstrate that B1/Alu and L1 repeats demarcate the genome into the A/B compartments and serve as the blueprint for the three-dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes. Our finding explains the robustness and evolutionary conservation of nuclear chromatin organization in mammals.H3K9me3 ChIP-seq upon L1 AMO treatment;We electrotransfected L1 AMO into mESC to block L1 transcripts for 36 h and a standard control from GenTools was used as control -""SCR"".

Identification of age-related changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in T cells from thymus to periphery (60K),GSE112391,Mus musculus,Aging of immune system is characterized by progressive decline of physiological and cellular function of T cells. Recent studies of naÃ¯ve T cells from young and old mice have identified age-related altered gene expressions but the mechanisms underlying age associated changes of naÃ¯ve T cells remain poorly understood. Here we compared the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in mature CD4 and CD8 thymocytes and in naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T cells of spleen between young (6-8 weeks) and old (79-121 weeks) C57Bl/6 mice. We used Agilent microarray method and identified the age-related altering gene expressions 1) only in mature CD4 and CD8 T cell from thymus， 2) shared by both thymus and spleen naÃ¯ve T cells， and 3) only in naÃ¯ve T cells from spleen. The shared changes include increased chemokine and chemokine receptor expressions and decreased cell cycle regulator expression. We further analyzed the chromatin basis of altered gene expression using Assaying Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) between young and old mice. We have identified age-related changes of chromatin accessibility in T cells from thymus and spleen， and some correlated changes between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Overall， we observedmore age-related alterations of gene expression and chromatin accessibility inthymus than in spleen， suggesting some age-related changes of T cells in thymus did not retain in periphery. Together， our findings have identified tissue specific altered gene expressions and chromatin status in T cells during aging and further study of these altered genes will shed new insights into the mechanisms underlying these age-related changes.,Here we compared the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in mature CD4 and CD8 thymocytes and in naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T cells of spleen between young (6-8 weeks) and old (79-121 weeks) C57Bl/6 mice.,nan,
MPP8 is essential for sustaining self-renewal of ground-state pluripotent stem cells,GSE150926,Mus musculus,Deciphering the mechanisms that control the pluripotent ground state is key for understanding embryonic development. Nonetheless， the epigenetic regulation of ground-state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is not fully understood. Here， we identify the epigentic protein MPP8 as being essential for ground-state pluripotency. Its depletion leads to cell cycle arrest and spontaneous differentiation. MPP8 has been suggested to repress LINE1 elements by recruiting the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex to H3K9me3-rich regions. Unexpectedly， we find that LINE1 elements are efficiently repressed by MPP8 lacking the chromodomain， while the unannotated C-terminus is essential for its function. Moreover， we show that SETDB1 recruits MPP8 to its genomic target loci， whereas transcriptional repression of LINE1 elements is maintained without retaining H3K9me3 levels. Taken together our findings demonstrate that MPP8 protects the DNA-hypomethylated pluripotent ground state through its association with the HUSH core complex， however， independently of detectable chromatin binding and maintenance of H3K9me3.,MPP8， FLAG and H3K9me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation profiles (ChIP-seq) analyzed in mouse embryonic stem cells which have been engineered to homozygously express MPP8 carrying a C-terminal miniAID (mAID) tag from the endogenous Mphosph8 locus as well as the E3 ligase OsTIR1 exogenously (Mpp8mAID; OsTIR1 cells).

Investigation of Drosophila fruitless neurons that express Dpr/DIP cell adhesion molecules,GSE162098,Drosophila melanogaster,Drosophila reproductive behaviors are directed by fruitless neurons. A reanalysis of genomic studies shows that genes encoding dpr and DIP Immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) members are expressed in fru P1 neurons. We find that each fru P1 and dpr/DIP (fru P1 â© dpr/DIP) overlapping expression pattern is similar in both sexes， but there are dimorphisms in neuronal morphology and cell number. Behavioral studies of fru P1 â© dpr/DIP perturbation genotypes indicates that the mushroom body functions together with the lateral protocerebral complex to direct courtship behavior. A single-cell RNA-seq analysis of fru P1 neurons shows that many DIPs have high expression in a small set of neurons， whereas the dprs are often expressed in a larger set of neurons at intermediate levels， with a myriad of dpr/DIP expression combinations. Functionally， we find that perturbations of sex hierarchy genes and of DIP-Îµ change the sex-specific morphologies of fru P1 â© DIP-Î± neurons.,scRNA-seq using 10x Genomics CHROMIUM Single Cell 3â Solution V2 Chemistry of 48hr after puparium formation (APF) male Drosophila Central Nervous System (CNS) cells where fru P1-expressing cells were genetically labeled with GFP.,33616528,Elife
Temporal scRNAseq identifies dynamic transcriptional programs that dictate the outcome of ER stress,GSE149633,Mus musculus,Perturbation of tissue homeostasis accompanies a diversity of inflammatory pathologies and imposes metabolic constraints at the cellular level that elicit ER stress， protein misfolding， and cell death. In response to ER stress， cells initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR)， which determines divergent cell fate decisions， either promoting recovery of ER proteostasis and cell survival or triggering programmed cell death. However， the mechanisms by which the UPR transitions from the adaptive to terminal state are not fully understood. Here， we leverage single-cell genomics to define dynamic transcriptional states associated with the adaptive versus terminal UPR in the intestinal epithelium. We recovered the terminal-UPR signature， which dictates adaptation versus programmed cell death in response to ER stress.,At monolayer differentiation day3 from the intestinal spheroids， treat 0.5ug/ml of Tm (for 25hr sample) or DMSO (for DMSO or 13hr set). 12hrs later， treat Tm on one of the DMSO set to make the 13hr set.

Effect of ASCL1 phosphorylation status on chromatin binding and target regulation in neuroblastoma,GSE153823,Homo sapiens,ASCL1， a basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor， is a master regulator of developmental neurogenesis and a crucial component of transcription factor cocktails that can convert heterologous cell types such as fibroblasts into neurons. The ability of ASCL1 to drive neuronal differentiation is controlled by multi-site phosphorylation but how this modification controls the genome-wide transcriptional activity of ASCL1 is unknown.  Using human neuroblastoma cells that maintain a rapidly dividing neuroblastic phenotype yet retain the ability to undergo differentiation as a model system， we find that phosphorylation of ASCL1 has limited effect on target gene promoter association， but predominantly regulates  its binding to a subset of distal enhancer regions， resulting in extensive differences in target control by activation， as well as direct and indirect gene repression.  These genome-wide analyses reveal how post-translational modification of ASCL1 can change its structure and function， driving it to differential regulatory elements to change cell fate， and controlling ASCL1âs activity as a master transcription regulator of neurogenesis. Using functional mutational and pharmacological approaches， we find that preventing CDK-dependent phosphorylation of ASCL1 in neuroblastoma cells results in co-ordinated suppression of the MYC-driven core circuit supporting neuroblast identity and proliferation， while simultaneously activating a gene programme driving neuronal differentiation. Thus， we show targeting the post-translational modification of a key developmental regulator can re-engage  a latent genome-wide programme forcing mitotic exit and differentiation in cancer cells.,RNA-seq analysis of SH-SY5Y ASCL1-doxycycline-inducible cells. 5 replicates each of 2 unique clones were used， for uninduced， WT-induced， and S-A induced cells.

Effect of ASCL1 phosphorylation status on chromatin binding and target regulation in neuroblastoma,GSE153823,Homo sapiens,ASCL1， a basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor， is a master regulator of developmental neurogenesis and a crucial component of transcription factor cocktails that can convert heterologous cell types such as fibroblasts into neurons. The ability of ASCL1 to drive neuronal differentiation is controlled by multi-site phosphorylation but how this modification controls the genome-wide transcriptional activity of ASCL1 is unknown.  Using human neuroblastoma cells that maintain a rapidly dividing neuroblastic phenotype yet retain the ability to undergo differentiation as a model system， we find that phosphorylation of ASCL1 has limited effect on target gene promoter association， but predominantly regulates  its binding to a subset of distal enhancer regions， resulting in extensive differences in target control by activation， as well as direct and indirect gene repression.  These genome-wide analyses reveal how post-translational modification of ASCL1 can change its structure and function， driving it to differential regulatory elements to change cell fate， and controlling ASCL1âs activity as a master transcription regulator of neurogenesis.

Systematic comparison of high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods for immune cell profiling [DS],GSE163785,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines， simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes.  We evaluate methods by their cell recovery rate， library efficiency， sensitivity， and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type.  We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5â v1 and 3â v3 methods.  We demonstrate that these methods have fewer drop-out events which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.,Various single-cell RNA-seq methods used to generate libraries using a 1:1:1:1 mixture of four lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat， TALL-104， EL4， IVA12).,33472597,BMC Genomics
Identify genomic binding sites of Tfcp2l1 in mouse embryonic stem cells grown in 2i medium,GSE159877,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in the 2i (an ERK inhibitor， PD0325901， and a GSK-3b inhibitor， CHIR99021) mimic pluripotent epiblasts in preimplantation blastocysts. Tfcp2l1 is a transcription factor highly expressed in ESCs grown in the 2i medium， suggesting that it plays in important role in ESC biology. To search for the putative role(s) of Tfcp2l1 in ESCs， we plan to use an integrated genomic approach--combing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq--to identify the direct targets of Tfcp2l1 in ESCs. ChIP-seq is used to identify the genomic bindings sites of Tfcp2l1 in ESCs grown in the 2i medium.,Two repeats were performed and each repeat includes one input and one ChIP. 50 million of ESCs grown in 2i were subject to ChIP-seq with 10 ug custom-made antibody against mouse Tfcp2l1. To identify genomic peaks of Tfcp2l1， enrichment of ChIP versus input across the genome was calculated.,33950553,EMBO Rep
Principles of Signalling Pathway Modulation for Enhancing Human NaÃ¯ve Pluripotency Induction [ATAC-Seq],GSE124614,Homo sapiens,Isolating human MEK/ERK signalling independent pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) with characteristics of naive pluripotency while maintaining differentiation competence and genetic integrity， remains challenging. Here we engineer reporter systems that allow screening for conditions that induce molecular and functional features of human naive pluripotency. Synergistic inhibition of WNT-ÃCATENIN， PKC and SRC signalling enables induction of teratoma competent naÃ¯ve human PSCs， with capacity to differentiate into trophoblast stem cells (TSC) and extraembryonic endodermal (XEN) cells in vitro. Divergent signalling and transcriptional requirements for boosting naÃ¯ve pluripotency were found between mouse and human. P53 depletion in human naÃ¯ve PSCs endows them with competitiveness to better contribute to mouse-human cross-species chimeric embryos upon priming. Finally， MEK/ERK inhibition can be substituted with inhibition for NOTCH/RBPj， which allows inducing alternative human naÃ¯ve-like PSCs with diminished risk for deleterious global DNA hypomethylation. Our findings set a framework for defining the signalling foundations of human naÃ¯ve pluripotency.,Human pluropotent cells (PSCs) maintained in naÃ¯ve conditions (Enhanced-NHSM)， are compared to conventional/primed human PSCs， from various cell lines,33915080,Cell Stem Cell

In this part， we systematically profiled single-cell transcriptomes of double knocking-out (DKO) and single knocking-out (SKO) cells of GI pairs identified in our GI screenings， and tried to decipher the role of transcription in the phenotypic effects of GIs.,Cell library expressing dual CROPseq-sgRNAs was constructed by infection of CROPseqGuide-Puro-sgRNAs viruses and CROPseqGuide-Blasti-sgRNAs viruses sequentially.

Cells were then frozen， and passed for the next infection of CROPseqGuide-Blasti viruses. After 24 h of infection， Blasticidin (15 ng/Âµl) was added for selection. 72 of different pair-wised sgRNA combinations in total were included in the CROPseq cell library. Cell library was then cultured in different media and harvested for single cell transcriptome profiling.

The repressive genome compartment is established early in the cell cycle before forming the lamina associated domains,GSE124205,Mus musculus,Three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is thought to be important for regulation of gene expression. Chromosome conformation capture-based studies have uncovered ensemble organizational principles such as active (A) and inactive (B) compartmentalization. In addition， large inactive regions of the genome associate with the nuclear lamina， the Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). Here we investigate the dynamic relationship between A/B-compartment organization and the 3D organization of LADs. Using refined algorithms to identify active (A) and inactive (B) compartments from Hi-C data and to define LADs from DamID， we confirm that the LADs correspond to the B-compartment. Using specialized chromosome conformation paints， we show that LAD and A/B-compartment organization are dependent upon chromatin state and A-type lamins. By integrating single-cell Hi-C data with live cell imaging and chromosome conformation paints， we demonstrate that self-organization of the B-compartment within a chromosome is an early event post-mitosis and occurs prior to organization of these domains to the nuclear lamina.,DamID-seq in primary MEFs， and primary MEFs after epigenetic perturbation or laminA/C knockdown.,34775987,Genome Biol

Identification of age-related changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in T cells from thymus to periphery (44K),GSE112390,Mus musculus,Aging of immune system is characterized by progressive decline of physiological and cellular function of T cells. Recent studies of naÃ¯ve T cells from young and old mice have identified age-related altered gene expressions but the mechanisms underlying age associated changes of naÃ¯ve T cells remain poorly understood. Here we compared the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in mature CD4 and CD8 thymocytes and in naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T cells of spleen between young (6-8 weeks) and old (79-121 weeks) C57Bl/6 mice. We used Agilent microarray method and identified the age-related altering gene expressions 1) only in mature CD4 and CD8 T cell from thymus， 2) shared by both thymus and spleen naÃ¯ve T cells， and 3) only in naÃ¯ve T cells from spleen. The shared changes include increased chemokine and chemokine receptor expressions and decreased cell cycle regulator expression. We further analyzed the chromatin basis of altered gene expression using Assaying Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) between young and old mice. We have identified age-related changes of chromatin accessibility in T cells from thymus and spleen， and some correlated changes between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Overall， we observedmore age-related alterations of gene expression and chromatin accessibility inthymus than in spleen， suggesting some age-related changes of T cells in thymus did not retain in periphery. Together， our findings have identified tissue specific altered gene expressions and chromatin status in T cells during aging and further study of these altered genes will shed new insights into the mechanisms underlying these age-related changes.,Here we compared the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in mature CD4 and CD8 thymocytes and in naÃ¯ve CD4 and CD8 T cells of spleen between young (6-8 weeks) and old (79-121 weeks) C57Bl/6 mice.,nan,

NF-kB Perturbation Reveals Unique Immunomodulatory Functions in Prx1+ Fibroblasts that Promote Atopic Dermatitis,GSE172226,Mus musculus,Skin is composed of diverse cell populations that cooperatively maintain homeostasis. Upregulation of the NF-kB pathway may lead to the development of chronic inflammatory disorders of the skin， but the early events in situ are not well understood. Through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data via iterative Random Forest Leave One Out Prediction (iRF-LOOP)， an explainable artificial intelligence (X-AI) method， we identified an immunoregulatory role for a unique Prx1+ fibroblast subpopulation. Disruption of Ikkb/NFkB under homeostatic conditions in these fibroblasts paradoxically induced skin inflammation due to the over-expression of CCL11 (eotaxin-1) characterized by eosinophil infiltration and a subsequent Th2 immune response. Because the inflammatory phenotype resembled that seen in human atopic dermatitis (AD)， we examined validated human AD skin samples and found that human AD fibroblasts also over-expressed CCL11 compared to control skin. Importantly， we demonstrate that monoclonal antibody treatment against CCL11 was therapeutically effective in reducing the eosinophilia and Th2 inflammation in vivo. Taken together， the murine model and human AD specimens point to dysregulated Prx1+ fibroblasts as a previously unrecognized etiologic factor that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD-like lesions and suggest targeting CCL11 as a novel way to treat AD-like lesions.,Ventral skin single-cell mRNA profiles of 4 week old wild type (WT) and Prx1Cre+Ikkbf/f (Ikkb-deleted) mice.,nan,

Mapping and modeling the genomic basis of differential RNA isoform expression at single-cell resolution with LR-Split-seq,GSE168776,Mus musculus,The rise in throughput and quality of long-read sequencing should allow unambiguous identification of full-length transcript isoforms. However， its application to single-cell RNA-seq has been limited by throughput and expense. Here we develop and characterize long-read Split-seq (LR-Split-seq)， which uses combinatorial barcoding to sequence single cells with long reads. Applied to the C2C12 myogenic system， LR-split-seq associates isoforms to cell types with relative economy and design flexibility.

Targeted deletion of an Nr4a1Â­ associated enhancer ablates Ly6Clow monocytes while protecting pleiotropic gene function in macrophages [ChIP-seq],GSE80031,Mus musculus,Mononuclear phagocytes are a diverse cell family that occupy all tissues and assume numerous functions to support tissue and systemic homeostasis. Our ability to investigate the roles of individual subsets is limited by an absence of approaches to ablate gene function within specific sub-populations. Using Nr4a1-dependent Ly6Clow monocytes as a representative cell type we show that enhancer deletion addresses these limitations. Combining ChIP-Seq and molecular approaches we identify a single， conserved， sub-domain within the Nr4a1 enhancer that is essential for Ly6Clow monocyte development. Mice lacking this enhancer lack Ly6Clow monocytes but retain Nr4a1 gene expression in macrophages during steady state and in response to LPS. Nr4a1 is a key negative regulator of inflammatory gene expression and decoupling these processes allows Ly6Clow monocytes to be studied without confounding influences. Enhancer targeting possesses greater specificity than cre recombinase-mediated gene deletion， providing a route to generate loss-of-function models in closely related cell types.,ChIP-Sequencing for histone modifications H3K4me2 and H3K27ac in primary murine monocyte dendritic cell precursors (MDP)， common monocyte progenitors (cMoP)， Ly6Chi monocytes and Ly6Clow monocytes sorted from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice/,27814941,Immunity

scRNAseq of Aging Drosophila ISCs [NGS1910],GSE157775,Drosophila melanogaster,Tissue homeostasis requires long-term lineage fidelity of somatic stem cells. Whether and how age-related changes in somatic stem cells impact the faithful execution of lineage decisions remains largely unknown. Here， we address this question using genome-wide chromatin accessibility and transcriptome analysis as well as single cell RNA-seq to explore stem cell intrinsic changes in the aging Drosophila intestine. These studies indicate that in stem cells of old flies， promoters of Polycomb (Pc) target genes become differentially accessible， resulting in the increased expression of enteroendocrine (EE) cell specification genes. Consistently， we find age related changes in the composition of the EE progenitor cell population in aging intestines， as well as a significant increase in the proportion of EE-specified ISCs and progenitors in aging flies. We further confirm that Pc-mediated chromatin regulation is a critical determinant of EE cell specification in the Drosophila intestine. Pc is required to maintain expression of stem cell genes while ensuring repression of differentiation and specification genes. Our results identify Pc group proteins as central regulators of lineage identity in the intestinal epithelium and highlight the impact of age-related decline in chromatin regulation on tissue homeostasis.,For the scRNA-seq experiments， we used the wild-type WDah fly line and dissected whole midguts at young (~7d)， mid-age (~30d) and old time-points (~60d). In total， we had two young， one mid age and two old samples. The cell density and viability of single-cell suspension were determined by Vi-CELL XR cell counter (Beckman Coulter). All of the processed samples had very high percentage of viable cells (>90%). The cell density was used to impute the volume of single cell suspension needed in the reverse transcription (RT) master mix， aiming to achieve ~6，000 cells per sample. cDNAs and libraries were prepared following manufacturerâs user guide (10x Genomics). Libraries were profiled on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies) and quantified using Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems).

The hepatic transcriptome of liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse offspring,GSE141077,Mus musculus,At 2 months of age， liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice present hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore， LIRKO mice have increased levels of hepatic cholesterol. Indeed， many changes seen in cholesterol metabolism in LIRKO mice are also observed in humans with metabolic syndrome. For example， both show decreased levels of HDL and increased secretion of apoB and VLDL. These findings make the LIRKO mouse a unique non-dietary model of insulin resistant， hyperglycemia， dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis that resembles several clinical features of the human metabolic syndrome. By hepatic transcriptomic analysis of the wild-type (WT) offspring of LIRKO mice， we identify that members of the TGF-Î² family are differentially expressed in the offspring， including the NREP and GDF15.,LIRKO (insulin receptor-IRlox/lox; Albumin-Cre+/-) mice were generated as previously described. The control offspring group consisted of the F1 offspring from a control male and female (insulin receptor-IRlox/lox; Albumin-Cre-/-). Control parents were crossed for 4 generations for minimizing any epigenetic memory from the presence of Cre. Father LIRKO offspring (FL) resulted from the crossing of a male LIRKO with a control female. Mother LIRKO offspring (ML) resulted from the breeding of a control male with a LIRKO female.

RNA-seq of human iPS derived  macrophages with or without KLF1- transcription factor Activation,GSE125150,Homo sapiens,Red blood cells (RBCs) mature within a specialized niche (the erythroblastic island (EI))， which consists of a central  macrophage surrounded by differentiating erythroblasts. Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell derived macrophages (iPSC-DMs) enhance proliferation and terminal maturation of Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) CD34+ derived erythroid cells and iPSC derived erythroid cells. These effects are further increased when an inducible KLF1-ERT2 fusion protein is activated in iPSC-DMs.  To assess the mechanism of action， we sought to compare the transcriptome of iPSC-DMs with and without KLF1 activation. For this， we used an inducible IPSC line (iKLF1.2) in which upon tamoxifen addition， the KLF1 transcription factor is translocated to nucleus and consequently KLF1 downstream targets are expressed. The identification and characterisation of could identify factors involved in erythroid maturation and thus helpful to improve current protocols to manufacture RBCs  in vitro.,iKLF1.2 iPSCs were differentiated to macrophages and then split into 2 groups， one was treated with tamoxifen for the last 4 days of culture to activate KLF1. The other group was not treated with tamoxifen. Four biologically independent differentiation experiments were carried out and so 8 samples were generated: 4 samples of untreated iKLF1.2 iPSCs-derived macrophages and 4 samples of tamoxifen treated iKLF1.2 iPSC-derived macrophages. Total RNA was extracted from each sample and RNA integrity was of a high enough quality for library preparation， as all RIN values were above 9 for every sample.,30787325,Nat Commun

Enhancers are Activated by p300/CBP Activity-Dependent PIC Assembly， RNAPII Recruitment and Pause Release [ChIP-Seq],GSE146324,Mus musculus,The metazoan-specific acetyltransferase p300/CBP is involved in activating signalinduced， enhancer-mediated transcription of cell-type-specific genes. However， the global kinetics and mechanisms of p300/CBP activity-dependent transcription activation remain poorly understood. We performed genome-wide， time-resolved analyses to show that enhancers and super-enhancers are dynamically activated through p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation， deactivated by the opposing deacetylase activity， and kinetic acetylation directly contributes to maintaining cell identity at very rapid timescales. The acetyltransferase activity is dispensable for the recruitment of p300/CBP and transcription factors， but essential for promoting the recruitment of TFIID and RNAPII at virtually all enhancers and enhancer-regulated genes. This identifies pre-initiation complex assembly as a dynamically controlled step in the transcription cycle and reveals p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation as the signal that specifically promotes transcription initiation at enhancer-regulated genes. We propose that p300/CBP activity uses a ârecruit-and-releaseâ mechanism to simultaneously promote RNAPII recruitment and pause release， and thereby， enables kinetic activation of enhancer-mediated transcription.,Pol2， p300， BRD4， and H3K27ac， H3K27me3， H3K4me1， Oct4， Nanog， TAF1 and TBP ChIP-seq before and after A-485 or JQ1 treatment in mES cell grown in 2i.,33765415,Mol Cell
The transcriptomic changes induced by NREP downregulation in HepG2 cells,GSE141078,Homo sapiens,To evaluate the global transcriptomic changes induced by Neuronal Regeneration Related Protein (NREP) downregulation，  we employed RNA-sequencing in HepG2 cells lacking NREP. Enriched pathway analyses of upregulated genes revealed pathways involved in cholesterol synthesis， fatty acid metabolism， NAFLD and PI3K-250 AKT signaling. In contrast， enriched downregulated genes included those for membrane trafficking， non-sense mediated decay， glucagon signaling， and cell-cycle. Differentially expressed genes included HMGCR (cholesterol synthesis) and TGFBR1 (TGF-Î² signaling and fibrosis).,HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and non-essential amino acids.  Cells were trypsinized at 70% of confluency and reverse transfection was performed using 30 nM of genome smart-pool non-target siRNA (scramble)， or siNREP targeting 4 different sequences (Dpharmacon).

Molecular and cellular design of ovotestis development,GSE153961,Monopterus albus,Ovotestis often occurs in intersex individuals under certain pathological and physiological conditions. However， how ovotestis is formed remains unknown. Here， we report the first comprehensive single-cell developmental atlas of the model fish ovotestis. We provide an overview of ovotestis cell identities and a roadmap of germline， niche， and stem cell development in ovotestis by cell lineage reconstruction and a uniform manifold approximation and projection. We identify common progenitors of germline stem cells with two states， which reveal their bipotential nature to differentiate into both spermatogonial stem cells and female germline stem cells. Moreover， we found that ovotestis infertility was caused by developmental defects in oogenesis owing to dynamic autophagic degradation in female germline cells， and in spermatogenesis due to deficiency of histone-to-protamine replacement in spermatid differentiation. Notably， signaling pathways in gonadal niche cells and their interaction with germline cells synergistically determined cell fates of both male and female germlines in ovotestis. Overall， we reveal a cellular fate map of germline and niche cell development that shapes cell differentiation directions of ovotestis， and provide novel insights into ovotestis development.,Single cell transcriptome of ovotestis in Monopterus albus,33846307,Cell Death Dis
IL6/STAT3 co-opts ER/FOXA1 regulatory elements to drive metastasis in breast cancer (ChIP-Seq),GSE126004,Homo sapiens,Interleukin 6 (IL6) signaling has been associated with an aggressive and metastatic phenotype in multiple solid tumors including breast cancer， but its mechanism of action in mediating tumor progression and treatment response is not clear. By exploiting a clinically relevant intraductal xenograft model of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer， we demonstrate that IL6 increases both primary tumor growth and distant metastases. By integrating pre-clinical models and clinical specimens， we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mediates IL6-induced activation of a metastatic gene program from enhancer-elements shared with ER and its pioneer factor FOXA1. Although IL6 activated STAT3 and ER/FOXA1 share cis-regulatory regions， STAT3 drives transcription independent of ER and FOXA1 function， and the IL6/STAT3 gene program is not influenced by ER-targeted therapies， decoupling these two important pathways. This demonstrates that ER/FOXA1 and IL6/STAT3 are two parallel， but independent actionable pathways controlling breast cancer progression.,ChIP-seq in breast cancer cell lines in response to IL6 and in clinical samples.ChIP-sequencing on ER on T47D cells with FOXA1 siRNA with or without IL6,32679107,Cancer Cell
STARR-seq in 1.8 XX and XO mESCs during differentiation,GSE167355,Mus musculus,Developmental genes are controlled by complex cis-regulatory landscapes that integrate multiple signals to ensure the correct spatio-temporal expression pattern. To investigate the underlying regulatory principles， we use the Xist locus as a model， which encodes the master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation. Xist is upregulated at the primed pluripotent state in a female-specific manner， thus integrating developmental cues and X-dosage information. It remains poorly understood how these signals are decoded by the ~800kb genomic region that controls Xist. While a series of repressive cis-regulatory elements have been identified， the distal enhancers that activate Xist transcription remain largely unknown. Here we use STARR-seq to profile enhancer activity within the X inactivation center at the onset of random X-chromosome inactivation.,STARR-seq was performed in the 1.8 XX and 1.8 XO cell lines using the BAC clones of the RPCI-23 Female (C57BL/6J) Mouse BAC Library (RP23-106C4， RP23-11P22， RP23-423B1， RP23-273N4， RP23-71K8) as the input DNA source.

Next generation sequencing to assess prenatal exposure to aerosols of paraquat and TiO2 nanoparticles on the gene expression of the developing brain,GSE169579,Mus musculus,Nanopesticides (NPe) are innovative pesticides involving engineered nanomaterials (ENM) to increase the efficiency of plant protection products. However， no toxicological data is available on their inhalation toxicity and the potential cocktail effects between pesticide active substances and ENM. In particular， the neurodevelopmental toxicity of prenatal repeated exposures has not been specifically evaluated. To this end， C57Bl/6j gestating mice were exposed to aerosols in an ad hoc whole-body exposure chamber. Exposures consisted in low repeated doses of the paraquat herbicide (PQ)， and/or TiO2 nanoparticles (nTiO2). The monitoring of aerosol characteristics， in addition to their prior metrological characterization， enabled a precise estimation of the exposure doses received by animals， which can be extrapolated to the recommended exposure limit proposed by health agencies. We used RNA-seq to assess the gene expression in pups striatum at post-natal stage， in order to highlight possible neurodevelopmental alterations. This sensitive method revealed that both PQ and nTiO2 aerosols had a significant effect on the gene expression of the offspring， highlighting dysregulations of oligodendrocyte differentiation and neuronal maturation. Exposure to the nTiO2 aerosol modulated notably the regulation of neurotransmitters pathway being possibly indirect consequences of a minor change in the neuroinflammation state. No synergy was found between the PQ + nTiO2. Instead， the neurodevelopmental effects were surprisingly lower than the one measured for each substance separately.,Exposure of C57Bl/6J gestating mice to aerosols and assessment of the pups striatum transcriptome at post-natal stage to highlight possible neurodevelopmental alterations,nan,
Integrated single-cell analysis reveals coupled molecular gradient and functional subnetworks in the thalamic reticular nucleus,GSE145273,Mus musculus,The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)， the major source of thalamic inhibition， is known to regulate thalamocortical interactions critical for sensory processing， attention and cognition. TRN dysfunction has been linked to sensory abnormality， attention deficit and sleep disturbance across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently， little is known about the organizational principles underlying its divergent functions. We performed an integrative study linking single-cell molecular and electrophysiological features of the mouse TRN to connectivity and systems-level function. We found that TRN cellular heterogeneity is characterized by a transcriptomic gradient of two negatively correlated gene expression profiles， each containing hundreds of genes. Neurons in the extremes of this transcriptomic gradient express mutually exclusive markers， exhibit core/shell-like anatomical structure and have distinct electrophysiological properties. The two TRN subpopulations make differential connections to the functionally distinct first-order and higher order thalamic nuclei to form molecularly defined TRN-thalamus subnetworks. Selective perturbation of the two subnetworks in vivo revealed their differential role in regulating sleep. Taken together， our study provides a comprehensive atlas for TRN neurons at the single-cell resolution， and links molecularly defined subnetworks to the functional organization of the thalamo-cortical circuits.,The project involved 8 plates of TRN nuclei with NeuN selection， 9 plates of TRN nuclei without NeuN selection， 4 plates of TRN-adjacent (Thalamus and Globus Pallidus) nuclei， 7 plates hippocampus Pvalb+ nuclei， 2 plates somatosensory cortex Pvalb+ nuclei， 1 plate striatium Pvalb+ nuclei， 3 plates M2 cortex Pvalb+ nuclei， and 3 batches of Patch-seq samples.

Tracing the origin of hair follicle stem cells,GSE147372,Mus musculus,The scRNA-seq data are an integral part of the manuscript with the above title. Using a photo-labelling technique and RamDA-seq as described in the overall design， we obtained accurate scRNA-seq data from developing hair follicles (HFs)， reflecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular state transition during HF morphogenesis. Single cell transcriptome analysis identified cell types， which cannot be distinguished by known makers， their signature markers， and transcriptional state changes in developing HFs. By integration of the data from single cell live imaging， our findings revealed the origin and developmental trajectories of tissue stem cells (SCs)， leading to a new model of HF development and SC induction with unprecedented resolution.,Embryonic skin tissues contain a mix of different HF types at different developmental stages， rendering separation and transcriptional profiling of HFs at specific developmental stages difficult. We thus developed a transgenic mouse line expressing a photo-convertible fluorescent protein， nuclear Kikume Green-Red， which enables identification and photo-labelling of target HFs under a confocal microscope. Entire single whisker HFs at E12.0， E13.0， E13.5， E14.0， E15.0， and E17.0 were photo-converted. Basal epidermal cells of each photo-labelled HF (E12.0âE17.0， ITGA6+/CD31-/kikGR-red+ cells; E11.5， ITGA6+/CD31- cells) were isolated as single cells by FACS. All scRNA-seq libraries were constructed for RamDA-seq， a novel sensitive and accurate total scRNA-seq method. We obtained single cell full-length total RNA sequencing of developing whisker HFs as follows: E11.5， 94 cells; E12.0， 280 cells; E13.0， 276 cells; E13.5， 189 cells; E14.0， 183 cells; E15.0， 362 cells; E17.0， 282 cells (total: 1，666 single cells).Please note that total 1，666 samples were included in the data analysis， however， the processed data file contains only 1614 data columns due to low-quality samples (indicated as the sample 'characteristics: data quality = low').,34108685,Nature
Enhancers are Activated by p300/CBP Activity-Dependent PIC Assembly， RNAPII Recruitment and Pause Release [EU-Seq],GSE146326,Mus musculus,The metazoan-specific acetyltransferase p300/CBP is involved in activating signalinduced， enhancer-mediated transcription of cell-type-specific genes. However， the global kinetics and mechanisms of p300/CBP activity-dependent transcription activation remain poorly understood. We performed genome-wide， time-resolved analyses to show that enhancers and super-enhancers are dynamically activated through p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation， deactivated by the opposing deacetylase activity， and kinetic acetylation directly contributes to maintaining cell identity at very rapid timescales. The acetyltransferase activity is dispensable for the recruitment of p300/CBP and transcription factors， but essential for promoting the recruitment of TFIID and RNAPII at virtually all enhancers and enhancer-regulated genes. This identifies pre-initiation complex assembly as a dynamically controlled step in the transcription cycle and reveals p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation as the signal that specifically promotes transcription initiation at enhancer-regulated genes. We propose that p300/CBP activity uses a ârecruit-and-releaseâ mechanism to simultaneously promote RNAPII recruitment and pause release， and thereby， enables kinetic activation of enhancer-mediated transcription.,EU-seq of mESC treated with JQ1 or A-485 and/or TSA.,33765415,Mol Cell
Genome wide H3K27ac status of endometrial stromal cells stimulated by cAMP， and cAMP under C/EBPb-knockdown,GSE148620,Homo sapiens,To know the role of C/EBPb in the changes of H3K27ac during desidualization， we compared the H3K27 profiles between cAMP-stimulation and cAMP-stimulation under C/EBPb-knockdown.,ESCs were transfected with control or C/EBPb siRNA and then treated with or without cAMP for 4 days. Cells cultured simultaneously with RNA-sequence experiment were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to the medium at a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at 37 Â°C.  Cross-linking was terminated by addition of glycine (0.125 M， final concentration).  ChIP was performed with H3K27ac antibody.  An unimmunoprecipitated control and immunoprecipitated DNA were used to prepare the ChIP-seq library with NEBNext DNA sample prep master mix set 1 (New England BioLabs， Ipswich， MA) and DNA sample prep kit， oligo only (Illumina) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. After the quality of the library was validated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology)， the ChIP-sequence library was sequenced by the Genome Analyzer GAIIx.  The obtained reads from the sequencing platform was first applied for quality checking by the fastx quality stats program in the FASTX-Toolkit package (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/).  The reads that passed the quality checking were then mapped to the human reference genome sequence (hg19) by using the bowtie program followed by Model-Based Analysis of ChIP-Sequence (MACS) to detect the H3K27ac regions.,nan,
Mir-146a wild-type 3' sequence identity is dispensable for proper innate immune function in vivo (RNA-Seq),GSE121232,Mus musculus,A long-prevailing model has held that the âseedâ region (nucleotides 2-8) of a microRNA is typically sufficient to mediate target recognition and repression. However， numerous recent studies， both within the context of defining miRNA/target pairs by direct physical association and by directly assessing this model in vivo in C. elegans have brought this model into question. To test the importance of miRNA 3' pairing in vivo， in a mammalian system， we engineered a mutant murine mir-146a allele in which the 5' half of the mature microRNA retains the sequence of the wild-type mir-146a but the 3Ê¹ half has been altered to be anti-complementary to the wild-type miR-146a sequence. Mice homozygous or hemizygous for this mutant allele are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type controls and do not recapitulate any of the immunopathology previously described for mir-146a-null mice. Our results strongly support the conclusion that 3Ê¹ pairing is dispensable in the context of the function of a key mammalian microRNA.,Gene expression profiling of either stimulated (1 ng/ml LPS for 16 hours) or resting bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from miR-146 wild-type (WT)， knock-out (KO) and non-seed swap (3'F) mice， in triplicate.,30777858,Life Sci Alliance

RNA-Sequencing of  spinach tissues with contrasting oxalate contents,GSE146711,Spinacia oleracea,Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare differentially expressed transcripts in roots and leaves of spinach cultivars with distinct oxalate contents using transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq),Methods: Leaf and root samples for RNA Seq analysis were collected from three independent spinach plants of cultivar PI175311 and Bloomsdale were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. Results: The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using PE Cluster Kit cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. After cluster generation， the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform， and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Raw reads of fastq format were processed to obtain clean reads by removing the adapter， reads containing ploy-N， and low quality reads from raw data. At the same time， Q20， Q30， and GC content， the clean data were calculated. Reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from SpinachBase (http://spinachbase.org/). Index of the reference genome was built using Bowtie v2.2.3， and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12. : HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the reads mapped to each gene. Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated from mapped read by featureCounts. Differential expression analysis of High N and Low N conditions (three biological replicates per tissue per treatment) was performed using the DESeq R package (1.18.0) (Anders and Huber， 2010). Genes with P-value < 0.05 found by DESeq were assigned as differentially expressed. Conclusions: The transcriptomic changes in leaf and root tissues was used for RNA-Seq analysis. A total of six libraries from leaf and root tissue were sequenced for each cultivar using the Illumina HiSeq platform. On average， 60 and million raw reads were generated from leaf tissues for bothe the cultivars. Across all reads ， the Q20 and Q30 percentage was more than 98 and 94%， respectively (sequencing error rate was less than 0.02%)， and GC content for the libraries was ~43%.  Among all the libraries， the ratio of total mapped reads was above 85%， of which ~81 % reads uniquely mapped to the reference genome . The data generated from all libraries provided a foundation for quality analyses.,34069886,Int J Mol Sci
Transcriptome alterations of an in vitro-selected， moderately-resistant， two-row malting barley in response to 3ADON， 15ADON and NIV chemotypes of Fusarium graminearium,GSE174081,Hordeum vulgare,Fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum is a devastating disease of malting barley. Mycotoxins associated with contaminated grain can be transferred from malt to beer and pose a health risk to consumers. In western Canada， F. graminearum has undergone an adaptive shift from 15ADON constituency to dominance by virulent 3ADON-producers， likewise NIV-producers have established in regions of southern United States. Lack of adapted resistance sources with adequate malting quality has promoted the use of alternative breeding methodologies such as in vitro selection. We studied the low-deoxynivalenol characteristic of in vitro selected， two-row malting barley variety âNormanâ by RNAseq in contrast to its parental line âCDC Kendallâ， when infected by 15ADON-， 3ADON- and NIV-producing isolates of F. graminearum. The current study documents higher mycotoxin accumulation by 3ADON isolates， thereby representing increased threat to barley production. At 72-96 hours post infection， significant alterations in transcription patterns were observed in both varieties with pronounced upregulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway and detoxification gene categories (UGT， GST， CyP450 and ABC) particularly in 3ADON treatment. Defense response was multi-tiered， where differential expression in âNormanâ associated with antimicrobial peptides (thionin 2.1， defensing， non-specific lipid-transfer protein) and stress-related proteins such as late embryogenesis abundant proteins， heat-shock， desiccation-related and a peroxidase (HvPrx5). Several gene targets identified in âNormanâ would be useful in application of breeding varieties with reduced deoxynivalenol content.,Adult plants of Norman and CDC Kendall were sprayed with macroconidia (5 x 10^4 spores ml-1) of  Fusarium graminearum (3ADON， 15ADON and NIV chemotypes + mock control). Seed tissue samples were collected at the time-points 72 h and 96h post-inoculation for Norman and CDC Kendall from all Fusarium treated and control plants. Total RNA was prepared and used for the RNA-seq analysis. Three independent biological replicates were sampled.,34456945,Front Plant Sci
The role of XIST in X-inactivation maintenance in B cells (RNA-seq),GSE164595,Homo sapiens,The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) XIST establishes X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female cells in early development and thereafter is thought to be largely dispensable. Here we show XIST is continually required in adult human B cells to silence a subset of X-linked immune genes such as TLR7.  XIST-dependent genes lack promoter DNA methylation and require continual XIST-dependent histone deacetylation. XIST RNA-directed proteomics and CRISPRi screen reveal distinctive somatic cell-specific XIST complexes， and identify TRIM28 that mediates Pol II pausing at promoters of X-linked genes in B cells. XIST dysregylation， reflected by escape of XIST-dependent genes， occurs in CD11c+ atypical memory B cells across single-cell transcriptome data in patients with female-biased autoimmunity and COVID-19 infection. XIST inactivation with TLR7 agonism suffices to promote isotype-switched atypical B cells. These results suggest cell-type-specific diversification of lncRNA-protein complexes increase lncRNA functionalities， and expand roles for XIST in sex-differences in biology and medicine.,RNA-seq of dCas9-Krab+ GM B cells transduced with guide RNA and treated with DNMT and EZH2 epigenetic inhibitors (sgNT+DMSO， sgXIST+DMSO， sgNT+inhibitors， sgXIST+inhibitors)， Trim28_KO GM B cells， Spen_deltaRRM GM B cells， sgNT and sgXIST cells that are overexpressed with anti-CRISPR protein ( sgNT+ACRIIA4， sgXIST+ACRIIA4)， dCas9-Krab+ IMR90 cells transduced with guide RNA (IMR90_sgNT， IMR90_sgXIST) .,33735607,Cell
Transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) precision cut liver slices (PCLS) exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and ethynylestradiol (EE2),GSE106968,Gadus morhua,Purpose: The objective of this study is to use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) PCLS culture and RNA-seq analysis to map gene expression responses to BaP and EE2 exposure in Atlantic cod.Methods: A total of 8 (3 females and 5 males) juvenile cod (G. morhua) (average body weight 498 g) were used for PCLS (n = 6-8 per group). PCLS preparation and chemical exposure in the culture was performed as previously described (Eide et al.， 2014). Cod liver slices were cultured in 24-well plates in the growth medium containing DMSO vehicle (CAS No: 67-68-5)， BaP (CAS No: 50-32-8) (10 or 1000 nm)， EE2 (CAS No: 57-63-6) (10 or 1000 nm) or BaP and EE2 mixture (10 or 1000 nm each). After 48 hors of culture， the slices were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 Â°C for RNA extraction.Results: In total， we had 47 high-quality samples， which were aligned to the published CDS of Atlantic cod (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-90/fasta/gadus_morhua/cds/Gadus_morhua.gad) using HISAT2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al.， 2015). Counts were generated from the alignments using SAMtools v1.4.1 (Li et al.， 2009). Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR v3.18.1 (McCarthy et al.， 2012) between control group and each treated group using paired test， after removing the genes with all-zero counts across all samples of the two compared groups. Differentially expressed genes were defined by p-value < 0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Several genes were differentially expressed in the BaP and EE2 and mixture treatment groups compared to the group. Hierarchical clustering showed that signature expression profile of top differentially expressed genes in response to the single treatment was distinctly maintained also in the equimolar binary mixtures.Conclusions: Combining high-throughput RNA-seq analysis and PCLS culture in Atlantic cod， we have shown that BaP and EE2 differentially regulated many genes in the AHR and ER pathways. The results show that omics data can be generated using an efficient PCLS in vitro culture system.,The seven treatment groups are DMSO (vehicle control)， 10nM BaP， 1uM BaP， 10nM EE2， 1uM EE2， 10nM Mix (BaP + EE2， 10nM each) and 1uM Mix (BaP + EE2， 1uM each). Each treatment group consists of PCLS RNA samples prepared from 6-8 fish (n = 6-8 per group). A total of 47 samples were sequenced. For each sample， 50 million 75 bp paired-end reads were generated.,29929084,Aquat Toxicol

Zfp281 functions as a barrier in embryonic stem cells to extraembryonic endoderm stem cells differentiation [ChIP-seq],GSE148231,Mus musculus,Cell-fate decisions and lineage commitment in early embryonic development are governed by comprehensive gene-regulatory programs. However， the molecular details leading to initial segregation of different lineages remain unclear. In the second cell-fate decision， epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PrE) lineages are formed from the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) cells at blastocyst stage. Here， we demonstrated that the pluripotency transcription factor Zfp281 is a barrier in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to PrE lineage differentiation. Zfp281 is expressed in extraembryonic endoderm cells (XENs)， the ex vivo derivatives of PrE. But knockdown of Zfp281 doesnât affect either maintenance or expression of the PrE master regulators in XENs. Using an in vitro differentiation protocol， we revealed that knockout of Zfp281 significantly increased the efficiency of ESC to XEN derivation. Using a Zfp281 rescue line for the knockout cells， we further confirmed that effects of elevated efficiency of XEN derivation is specifically due to loss of Zfp281. Mechanistically， we revealed that Zfp281 interacts with components in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)， and recruits PRC2 to promoters of PrE master regulators GATA4 and GATA6 for transcriptional and epigenetic repression. Taken together， our results demonstrated a novel role of Zfp281 in second cell-fate decision in embryonic stem cell differentiation.,Genome binding/occupancy profiling of Zfp281 and Suz12 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and extraembryonic endoderm stem cells (XENs) by ChIP sequencing.,32812113,Protein Cell

SWI/SNF senses carbon starvation with a pH-sensitive low complexity sequence,GSE174687,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Purpose: It is increasingly appreciated that intracellular pH changes are important biological signals. This motivates the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of pH-sensing. We determined that a nucleocytoplasmic pH oscillation was required for the transcriptional response to carbon starvation in S. cerevisiae.Methods: We performed RNA sequencing analysis to determine the extent of the requirement for theSNF5 QLC in the activation of glucose-repressed genes. Total RNA was extracted from WT， ÎQ-snf5 and HtoA-snf5 strains during exponentially growth (+Glu) and after 4 hours of glucose starvation. Next， Poly-A selection was performed using Dynabeads and libraries were performed following manufactures indications. Sequencing of the 32 samples was performed on an Illumina Hi-seq on two lanes. RNA-seq data were aligned to the University of California， Santa Cruz (UCSC)， sacCer2 genome using Kallisto (0.43.0，http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v34/n5/full/nbt.3519.html) and downstream visualization and analysis was done using R (3.2.2).

Single-cell Transcriptomics Resolves Intermediate Glial Progenitors and Uncovers a Pivotal Determinant of Cell Fate and Gliomagenesis,GSE122871,Mus musculus,The identity and heterogeneity of glial progenitors and their contributions to brain tumor malignancy remain elusive. By applying lineage-targeted single-cell-transcriptomics， we uncover an unanticipated diversity of glial progenitor pools with unique molecular identities in developing brain. Our analysis identifies distinct transitional intermediate states and their divergent developmental trajectories in astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages. Moreover， intersectional analysis uncovers analogous intermediate progenitors during brain tumorigenesis， wherein lineage-restricted oligodendrocyte-progenitor intermediates are abundant， hyper-proliferative and progressively reprogrammed towards a stem-like state susceptible to further malignant transformation. Similar actively cycling intermediate progenitors are prominent components in human gliomas with distinct driver mutations. We further unveil lineage-driving networks underlying glial fate specification and identify Zfp36l1 as necessary for oligodendrocyte-astrocyte lineage transition and glioma growth. Together， our results resolve the dynamic repertoire of common and divergent glial progenitors during development and tumorigenesis and highlight Zfp36l1 as a molecular nexus for balancing glial cell-fate decision and controlling gliomagenesis.,scRNA-seq:Individual cells were sampled from mice cortices of PDGFRa-GFP and hGFAP-GFP strains and mouse glioblastoma tissues.ATAC-seq:ATAC-seq sampled from E14.5 and P5 PDGFRa-GFP cells,30982771,Cell Stem Cell

499 GRKO vs WT Single Cell Seq,GSE131927,Mus musculus,Interferon-gamma (IFNG) augments immune function yet promotes T cell exhaustion through PDL1. How these opposing effects are integrated to impact immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is unclear. We show that while inhibiting tumor IFNG signaling decreases interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cells， it increases ISGs in immune cells by enhancing IFNG produced by exhausted T cells (TEX). In tumors with favorable antigenicity， these TEX mediate rejection. In tumors with neoantigen or MHC-I loss， TEX instead utilize IFNG to drive maturation of innate immune cells， including a PD1+TRAIL+ ILC1 population. By disabling an inhibitory circuit impacting PD1 and TRAIL， blocking tumor IFNG signaling promotes innate immune killing. Thus， interferon signaling in cancer cells and immune cells oppose each other to establish a regulatory relationship that limits both adaptive and innate immune killing. In melanoma and lung cancer patients， perturbation of this relationship is associated with ICB response independent of mutational burden.,Immune cells were profiled using single cell RNA sequencing from WT and IFNgR KO 499 tumors,nan,

RNA m6A methylation of 3Ê¹ splice site prevents binding of U2AF35 to inhibit splicing,GSE146873,Caenorhabditis elegans;Bombyx mori;Mus musculus,OThe N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification is widely used to alter the fate of mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the C. elegans writer METT-10 (orthologue of mouse METTL16) deposits an m6A mark on the 3â² splice site (AG) of the SAM synthetase pre-mRNA which inhibits its proper splicing and protein production. The mechanism is triggered by a rich diet， and acts as an m6A-mediated switch to stop SAM production and regulate its homeostasis. Although the mammalian SAM synthetase pre-mRNA is not regulated via this mechanism， we show that splicing inhibition by 3â² splice site m6A is conserved in mammals. The modification functions by physically preventing the essential splicing factor U2AF35 from recognizing the 3â² splice site. We propose that use of splice site m6A is an ancient mechanism for splicing regulation.,Abundance and distribution of m6A modification was compared between transcriptomes of the mouse and the worm by m6A-IP RNA-Seq on mixed equimolar amounts of corresponding RNAs.    The effect of METT-10 on m6A distribution was analyzed by performing  m6A-IP RNA-Seq on RNA isolated from wild-type and mutant METT10 worms grown either on NA22 or OP50 plates.

BANP opens chromatin and activates CpG island regulated genes [ATAC-Seq],GSE155601,Mus musculus,In mammalian genomes， the vast majority of RNA polymerase II initiation events take place at CpG island promoters. Despite their relevance our understanding of their regulation remains limited. Here we identify Banp as the long sought-after TF that binds the orphan CGCG element in CpG islands by combining single-molecule footprinting with interaction proteomics. We show that Banp drives activity of CpG islands that control essential metabolic genes in the mouse and human genome. Banp binding is strongly repelled by DNA methylation of its motif in vitro and in vivo， which restricts most binding to CpG islands and accounts for its absence at aberrantly methylated CpG islands in cancer cells. Upon binding to an unmethylated motif， Banp opens chromatin and positions nucleosomes. These findings expand our understanding of CpG island gene regulation and put forth a model whereby CpG islands rely for their activity on methylation sensitive TFs capable of opening and organizing chromatin.,ATAC-seq in mouse ESCs.

Studies of genes and pathways regulated by the ZFP36 family in CD4+ T cells have focussed largely on cytokines， but their impact on metabolic reprogramming and differentiation is unclear. Using CD4+ T cells lacking Zfp36 and Zfp36l1， we combined the quantification of mRNA transcription， stability， abundance and translation with crosslinking immunoprecipitation and metabolic profiling to determine how they regulate T cell metabolism and differentiation. Our results suggest that ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 act directly to limit the expression of genes driving anabolic processes by two distinct routes: by targeting transcription factors and by targeting transcripts encoding rate-limiting enzymes. These enzymes span numerous metabolic pathways including glycolysis， one-carbon metabolism and glutaminolysis. Direct binding and repression of transcripts encoding glutamine transporter SLC38A2 correlated with increased cellular glutamine content in ZFP36/ZFP36L1-deficient T cells. Increased conversion of glutamine to Î±-ketoglutarate in these cells was consistent with direct binding of ZFP36/ZFP36L1 to Gls (encoding glutaminase) and Glud1 (encoding glutamate dehydrogenase). We propose that ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 as well as glutamine and Î±-ketoglutarate are limiting factors for the acquisition of the cytotoxic CD4+ T cell fate. Our data implicate ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 in limiting glutamine anaplerosis and differentiation of activated CD4+ T cells， likely mediated by direct binding to transcripts of critical genes that drive these processes.,mRNA-seq (3 biological replicates)， nascent， 4sU-labelled mRNA-seq (2 biological replcates， separated into labelled [nascent RNA]， unlabelled [pre-existing RNA] and total fractions) and Ribo-seq (5 biological replicates) were performed in activated CD4+ T cells from control and Zfp36/Zfp36l1 double conditional knockout mice. To identify direct targets of ZFP36-family proteins， iCLIP was performed on activated CD4+ T cells from WT C57BL/6 mice (3 biological replicates)， using two independent antibodies that bind to ZFP36L1.,36385275,Sci Rep
Induction of Muscle Regenerative Multipotent Stem Cells from Human Adipocytes by PDGF-AB and 5-Azacytidine [ChIP-seq],GSE151525,Homo sapiens,Terminally differentiated murine osteocytes and adipocytes can be reprogrammed using platelet-derived growth factorâAB and 5-Azacytidine into multipotent stem cells with stromal cell characteristics. To generate a product that is amenable for therapeutic application， we have modified and optimised culture conditions to reprogram human adipocytes into induced multipotent stem cells (iMS) and expand them in vitro. The basal transcriptomes of adipocyte-derived iMS cells and matched adipose-tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells were remarkably similar. However， there were distinct changes in histone modifications and CpG methylation at cis-regulatory regions consistent with an epigenetic landscape that was primed for tissue development and differentiation. In a non-specific tissue injury xenograft model， iMS cells contributed directly to new muscle， bone， cartilage and blood vessels with no evidence of teratogenic potential. In a cardiotoxin muscle injury model， iMS cells contributed specifically to satellite cells and myofibres without ectopic tissue formation. Taken together， human adipocyte derived iMS cells regenerate tissues in a context dependent manner without ectopic or neoplastic growth.,Distribution of regions with differential histone marks in AdMSCs and iMS cells.This submission represents the ChIP-seq component of the study.,33523875,Sci Adv
Robust single-cell discovery of RNA targets of RNA binding proteins and ribosomes [NP],GSE155708,Homo sapiens,RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of gene expression and RNA processing that are required for gene function. Yet， the dynamics of RBP regulation in single cells is unknown. To address this gap in understanding， we developed STAMP (Surveying Targets by APOBEC Mediated Profiling)， which efficiently detects RBP RNA interactions. STAMP does not rely on UV crosslinking or immunoprecipitation and， when coupled with single cell capture， can identify RBP and cell type specific RNA protein interactions for multiple RBPs and cell types in single pooled experiments. Pairing STAMP with long read sequencing also yields RBP target sites for full length isoforms.

HP1 drives de novo 3D genome reorganization in early Drosophila embryos (HiC),GSE140540,Drosophila melanogaster,The genome of the fertilized egg becomes structurally and functionally reorganized during early embryogenesis. This includes the segregation of active and inactive chromosome regions into A and B compartments， which are a fundamental feature of genome organization in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Mutually exclusive and attractive interactions within each compartment are thought to contribute to compartment formation1，2. However， the molecular nature of compartmental forces， and thus how compartments form， remain unknown. Here we show that HP1a is a major driver of compartmental segregation in Drosophila early development. Depletion of HP1a leads to an overall decrease of compartmentalization and increased intra-chromosomal interactions. Polymer modeling analysis of Hi-C data and ChIP-seq suggest that establishment of the B compartment is driven by HP1a-mediated attractive interactions. Thus， HP1 controls the establishment of higher order 3D structure during early embryogenesis.,We study the role of HP1 and H3K9me3 in establishing 3D genome organization at zygotic genome activation (stage 5). HP1 was depleted using RNAi and embryos at zygotic genome activation of knockdown and wildtype embryos were collected and analyzed.,33854237,Nature

Ultra-high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing by combinatorial fluidic indexing,GSE168620,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Cell atlas projects and high-throughput perturbation screens require single-cell sequencing at a scale that is challenging with current technology. To enable cost-effective single-cell sequencing for millions of individual cells， we developed âsingle-cell combinatorial fluidic indexingâ (scifi). The scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial pre-indexing of entire transcriptomes inside permeabilized cells with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using microfluidics. Pre-indexing allows us to load multiple cells per droplet and bioinformatically demultiplex their individual expression profiles. Thereby， scifi-RNA-seq massively increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq， and it provides a straightforward way of multiplexing thousands of samples in a single experiment. Compared to multi-round combinatorial indexing， scifi-RNA-seq provides an easier， faster， and more efficient workflow. In contrast to cell hashing methods， which flag and discard droplets containing more than one cell， scifi-RNA-seq resolves and retains individual transcriptomes from overloaded droplets.,We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines， validated it for primary human T cells， and applied our method in a highly multiplexed CRISPR screen with single-cell transcriptome readout of T cell receptor activation.,34059827,Nat Methods
Lack of TRMT2A， a tRNA methyltransferase， induces the generation of tRNA-derived small RNAs due to m5U54 tRNA hypomodification [Seq],GSE164405,Homo sapiens,Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules contain a variety of post-transcriptional modifications which are crucial for tRNA stability， translation efficiency， and fidelity. Besides their canonical roles in translation， tRNAs also originate tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs)， a class of small non-coding RNAs with regulatory functions ranging from translation regulation， to gene expression control and cellular stress response. Recent evidence show that tsRNAs are also modified， however the impact of tRNA epitranscriptome deregulation on tsRNAs generation is only now beginning to be uncovered. The 5-methyluridine (m5U) modification at position 54 of cytosolic tRNAs is one of the most common and conserved tRNA modifications among species. This modification is catalyzed by the tRNA methyltransferase TRMT2A， but its biological role remains largely unexplored. Here， we show that TRMT2A knockdown in human cells induces m5U54 tRNA hypomodification， resulting in angiogenin (ANG) dependent tsRNA formation. More specifically， m5U54 hypomodification is followed by ANG overexpression and tRNA cleavage near the anticodon， resulting in accumulation of 5âtRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (5âtiRNAs)， in particular 5âtiRNA-GlyGCC and 5âtiRNA-GluCTC. Additionally， transcriptomic analysis confirms that down-regulation of TRMT2A and consequently m5U54 hypomodification impacts the cellular stress response and RNA stability， which is often correlated with tsRNA generation. Accordingly， exposure to oxidative stress conditions induces TRMT2A down-regulation and tsRNA formation in mammalian cells. These results establish a link between tRNA demethylation and tsRNAs formation and unravel m5U54 as a tRNA cleavage protective mark.,Human tRF and tiRNAs were sequenced from HeLa cells transfected with a siCTRL (control condition) and HeLa cells transfected with siTRMT2A samples (tested condition). Three biological replicates were tested for each condition. For standard small RNA sequencing， the Illumina NextSeq instrument was used.Prior sequencing， between 1-2 ug of total RNA were purified from each sample. Integrity， quality and quantity of each RNA sample was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and NanodropTM instrument. Since tRNA derived fragments (tRF & tiRNA) are heavily decorated by RNA modifications that interfere with small RNA-seq library construction， total RNA samples were pre treated with the following: 3â-aminoacyl (charged) deacylation to 3â-OH for 3âadaptor ligation， 3â-cP (2â，3â-cyclic phosphate) removal to 3â-OH for 3âadaptor ligation， 5â-OH (hydroxyl group) phosphorylationto 5â-P for 5â-adaptor ligation， m1A and m3C demethylation for efficient reverse transcription. Sequencing libraries were size-selected for the RNA biotypes to be sequenced using an automated gel cutter.  The libraries were qualified and absolutely quantified using Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100. For standard small RNA sequencing on Illumina NextSeq instrument， the sequencing type was 50bp singleread. Cytoplasmic tRNA sequences were downloaded from GtRNAdb. Mitochondrial tRNA sequences were predicted with tRNAscan-SE software. To generate the mature tRNA libraries， we removed the predicted intronic sequences (if present) and added an additional 3â-terminal âCCAâ to each tRNA. To generate the precursor tRNA libraries， we included 40 nucleotides of flanking genomic sequence on either side of the original tRNA sequence.,33799331,Int J Mol Sci

Rapid remodeling of poised chromatin landscapes and transcription factor repurposing facilitate gene induction in natural killer cells,GSE145299,Mus musculus,Innate immune responses rely on rapid and precise orchestration of gene regulation mediated by accessibility of regulatory regions to key transcription factors.

Time-Dependent Transcriptome Profiling Reveals the Importance of Multiple Transcription Factors in Brachypodium Root Development,GSE131582,Brachypodium distachyon,The goal of this study was to examine the transcriptional events occuring during stress-free Brachypodium distachyon root development via illumina paired-end RNA-seq. 4 time-points were chosen that capture the transition from rapid vegetative growth into slower reproductive growth. Abstract - Root systems are dynamic， adaptable organs that play critical roles in plant development. Roots， however， remain understudied and therefore present opportunities for trait improvement in food and bioenergy crops. A comprehensive growth stage-based root phenotyping integrated with molecular signatures is required to advance our understanding of root growth and development. Here we studied Brachypodium distachyon rooting process by monitoring root biomass， length， branching， root-to-shoot ratio and Carbon-to-Nitrogen ratio during time. To provide insight into gene regulation that accompanies root development and biomass accumulation， we generated comprehensive transcript profiles of Brachypodium whole-root system at four initial developmental stages that capture the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Our stringent data analysis revealed that multiple biological processes and various families of transcription factors (TFs) were differentially expressed during root development. In particular， the AUX/IAA， ERFs， WRKY， NAC， and MADS TF family members were upregulated， while ARFs and GRFs were downregulated in a time-dependent manner. Our results suggested particular TF families and biological processes including trehalose metabolism as important factors possibly involved in root biomass accumulation. We introduced several Brachypodium root biomass-promoting genes which can be employed by the genome editing approaches for improving biomass productivity in grasses.,Brachypodium distachyon whole-root RNA-seq via illumina. 4 timepoints with 3 biological replicates each.

Assessment of a highly multiplexed RNA sequencing platform and comparison to existing high-throughput gene expression profiling techniques [microarray],GSE118799,Homo sapiens,In this study， we report the performance of one such technique denoted as sparse full length sequencing (SFL)， a ribosomal RNA depletion-based RNA sequencing approach that allows for the simultaneous sequencing of 96 samples and higher.  We offer comparisons to well established single-sample techniques， including: full coverage Poly-A capture RNA-seq and microarray， as well as another low-cost highly multiplexed technique known as 3â digital gene expression (3â DGE). Data was generated for a set of exposure experiments on immortalized human lung epithelial (AALE) cells in a two-by-two study design， in which samples received both genetic and chemical perturbations of known oncogenes/tumor suppressors and lung carcinogens.  SFL demonstrated improved performance over 3â DGE in terms of coverage， power to detect differential gene expression， and biological recapitulation of patterns of differential gene expression from in vivo lung cancer mutation signatures.,Microarray RNA expression for immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (AALE) exposed to chemical and genotypic perturbations,30891063,Front Genet
RNA-seq of Single-Cell Genotyping of Transcriptomes,GSE117824,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Somatic cancer driver mutations may result in distinctly diverging phenotypic outputs. Thus， a common driver lesion may result in cancer subtypes with distinct clinical presentations and outcomes. The diverging phenotypic outputs of mutations result from the superimposition of the mutations with distinct progenitor cell populations that have differing lineage potential. However， our ability to test this hypothesis has been challenged by currently available tools. For example， flow cytometry is limited in its inability to resolve lineage commitment of early progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) may provide higher resolution mapping of the early progenitor populations as long as high throughput technology is available to sequence thousands of single cells. Nevertheless， high throughput scRNA-seq is limited in its inability to jointly and robustly detect the mutational status and the transcriptional profile from the same cell.  To overcome these limitations， we propose the use of scRNA-seq combined with targeted mutation sequencing from transcrptional read-outs.,We apply this method to study myeloid neopasms， in which the comlex process of hematopoiesis is corrupted by mutated stem and progenitor cells.,31270458,Nature

TET2 is a component of the ER complex and controls 5mC to 5hmC conversion at ER cis-regulatory regions [ChIP-Seq],GSE153251,Homo sapiens,Estrogen receptor-a (ER) drives tumour development and metastasis in ER positive (ER+) breast cancer. GATA3 is a transcription factor that has been closely linked to ER function， but the role of GATA3 in ER transcriptional activity is not clear. We sought to identify the contribution of GATA3 to the ER complex by conducting quantitative multiplexed rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (qPLEX-RIME) to assess changes to the ER complex in response to GATA3 depletion. Unexpectedly， very few proteins were dissociated from the ER complex in the absence of GATA3， with the only major change being depletion of TET2 from the ER complex. In breast cancer cells and Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) tissue， TET2 binding events were shown to constitute a near-total subset of ER binding events， and loss of TET2 was functionally associated with reduced activation of proliferative pathways. To investigate the TET2-ER relationship， the role of TET2 in regulating DNA modifications in ER+ breast cancer cells was examined. TET2 knockdown did not appear to result in changes to global DNA methylation， however， oxidation of methylated DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was significantly reduced after TET2 depletion and these events occurred at ER enhancers. These findings implicate TET2 in the production and maintenance of 5hmC at ER sites， providing a potential mechanism for TET2-mediated regulation of ER target genes.,ChIP-seq in breast cancer cell lines， either untreated， or in response to TET2 knockdown or fulvestrant treatment.

MeCP2 regulates gene expression through direct interaction with H3K27me3 [ChIP_human: HCT116_vs_DKO1],GSE136118,Homo sapiens,MeCP2 plays a multifaceted role in gene expression regulation and chromatin organization. Interaction between MeCP2 and methylated DNA to regulate gene expression is well established. However， the widespread MeCP2 distribution suggests its additional interactions with chromatin. Here we show， by both biochemical and ChIP-seq analyses， that MeCP2 directly binds to nucleosome subunit proteins and is recruited to distinct chromatin regions where H3K27me3 is enriched. We further observed that the impact of MeCP2 on transcriptional changes is correlated with histone post-translational modification patterns. Our findings indicate that MeCP2 can be recruited to genomic loci via indirect binding and that interaction between MeCP2 and histone proteins plays a significant role in gene expression regulation.,To determine whether MeCP2 binding to H3K27me3 is independent of DNA methylation， we examined MeCP2-chromatin interactions in DKO cells， which have reduced  DNA methylation， and compared with parental HCT116 cell line.,32561780,Nat Commun

Human CD4+CD103+ cutaneous resident memory T cells are found in the circulation of healthy subjects,GSE131770,Homo sapiens,Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) persist locally in non-lymphoid tissues where they provide front-line defense against recurring insults. TRM at barrier surfaces express the markers CD103 and/or CD69 which function to retain them in epithelial tissues. In humans， neither the long-term migratory behavior of TRM nor their ability to re-enter the circulation and potentially migrate to distant tissue sites have been investigated. Using tissue explant cultures， we found that CD4+CD69+CD103+ TRM in human skin can downregulate CD69 and exit the tissue. Additionally， we identified a skin-tropic CD4+CD69-CD103+ population in human lymph and blood that is transcriptionally， functionally and clonally related to the CD4+CD69+CD103+ TRM population in the skin. Using a skin xenograft model， we confirmed that a fraction of the human cutaneous CD4+CD103+ TRM population can re-enter circulation， and migrate to secondary human skin sites where they re-assume a TRM phenotype. Thus， our data challenge current concepts regarding the strict tissue compartmentalization of CD4+ T cell memory in humans.,RNA-seq was performed on 5 populations of CD4+CD45RA-CLA+ T cells  sorted from human blood and skin (from 5 distinct healthy donors) based on expression of CD103 and CCR7.  19 total samples passed quality control checks and were included in subsequent analyses.,31278120,Sci Immunol

Robust single-cell discovery of RNA targets of RNA binding proteins and ribosomes [scRNA-seq],GSE155726,Homo sapiens,RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of gene expression and RNA processing that are required for gene function. Yet， the dynamics of RBP regulation in single cells is unknown.

Stereotyped transcriptomic transformation of somatosensory neurons in response to injury,GSE131272,Mus musculus,In mice， spared nerve injury replicates symptoms of human neuropathic pain andinduces upregulation of many genes in somatosensory neurons. Here we used single cell transcriptomics to probe the effects of partial infraorbital transection of the trigeminal nerve at the cellular level. Uninjured neurons were unaffected by transection of major nerve branches， segregating into many different classes. In marked contrast， axotomy rapidly transformed damaged neurons into just two new and closely-related classes where almost all original identity was lost. Remarkably， sensory neurons also adopted this transcriptomic state following various minor peripheral injuries. By genetically marking injured neurons， we showed that the injuryinduced transformation was reversible， with damaged cells slowly reacquiring normal gene expression profiles. Thus， our data expose transcriptomic plasticity， previously thought of as a driver of chronic pain， as a programed response to many types of injury and a potential mechanism for regulating sensation during wound healing.,Nuclei from trigeminal ganglia from wildtype， spared nerve injury mice (2-， 7-， 21-， and 75 days after injury)， chronic itch with facial lesions， and minor facial injury mice were isolated.  Neuronal nuclei were purified with anti-NeuN antibody and single nucleus RNA-seq were performed with either the Drop-Seq or 10x Genomics method.,31592768,Elife
Systematic functional characterization of BAF mutations yields novel intra-complex synthetic lethalities [ATAC-Seq],GSE108386,Homo sapiens,Aberrations in genes coding for subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex are highly abundant in human cancers. Currently， it is not understood how these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cancer development and how they can be targeted therapeutically. The cancer type specific occurrence patterns of certain subunit mutations suggest subunit-specific effects on BAF complex function， possibly by the formation of aberrant residual complexes. Here， we systematically characterize the effects of individual subunit loss on complex composition， chromatin accessibility and gene expression in a panel of knock-out cell lines deficient for 22 targetable BAF subunits. We observe strong， specific and often discordant alterations dependent on the targeted subunit and show that these explain intra-complex co-dependencies， including the novel synthetic lethal interactions SMARCA4-ARID2， SMARCA4-ACTB and SMARCC1-SMARCC2.

Global analysis of enhancer targets: Mosaic-seq,GSE129826,Homo sapiens,Single-cell perturbation assays such as Mosaic-seq enable highly multiplexed functional assessment of enhancers in their endogenous genomic context. By introducing a few computational and experimental improvements， we expanded the Mosaic-seq analysis to capture the secondary gene targets of enhancers. Our analysis of >500 putative enhancers in K562 cells demonstrates that many secondary hits are shared among enhancers targeting different transcriptional factors， which reveals an interwoven enhancer-driven gene regulatory network. Together， our data underscore the flexibility of manipulating gene transcription by modifying enhancer activity.,We performed Mosaic-seq on 518 enhancers in K562 cells. We used 10X genomics 3â V2 kit to prepare the single-cell transcriptome libraries.

Rare earth elements show antagonistic interactions as revealed by transcriptome profiling in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.,GSE176268,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,Purpose; Here we compare the transcriptomic effects of three REEs; Ce， Tm and Y， and a mixture of all three on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in order to determine the degree of overlap of their effects.Methods; Transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) analysis performed on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (wild-type strain， CC-125 aka 137c， Chlamydomonas resource center) exposed for 2 h to one of three soluble REEs (Ce， Tm， Y) salts at 0.5 Î¼M or to an equimolar ternary mixture of these REEs. Illumina HiSeq (v.4) was used for the paired-end sequencing (2 Ã 100 base pairs) of 25 samples (5 replicates for each treatment: Ce; Tm; Y; Mix; Controls). For each sample， ca. 55 million of reads with their sequences， identification and quality scores were stored in two FastQ files.Results; Known functions of the differentially expressed genes support effects of REEs on protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum， phosphate transport and the homeostasis of Fe and Ca. The only stress response detected related to protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum. When the REEs were applied as a mixture， antagonistic effects were overwhelmingly observed with transcriptomic results suggesting that the REEs were initially competing with each other for bio-uptake.Conclusions; Our study represents the first detailed analysis of REE transcriptomic effects in a green microalga that is ubiquitous to fresh waters. Results generated by RNA-seq technology suggest that the approach of government agencies to regulate the REEs using biological effects data from single metal exposures may be a largely conservative approach.,mRNA profiles of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed for 2 h to one of three soluble REEs (Ce， Tm， Y) salts at 0.5 Î¼M or to an equimolar ternary mixture of these REEs,nan,

RNA/WES/ATAC/scRNA sequencing of murine melanoma primary and LN metastases,GSE117529,Mus musculus,The purpose of this study is to identify transcriptional， mutational， andepigenetic differences between LN metastases from primary tumors. Using in vivo serial passaging of the minimally metastatic syngeneic murine melanoma cell line B16-F0， we have generated nearly 300 unique cell lines spanning nine generations of in vivo passaging， derived from LNs， and exhibiting varying degrees of metastatic potential to LNs. Here， we perform mRNAseq on 30 of the lines representing a range of anatomical locations (distinct LNs)， generations， and phylogenetic lineages. The subsequent differential expression analysis reveals a marked upregulation of immune-related genes. Additionally， we perform WES to identify differences in particular mutations， total mutational burden， and predicted neoantigen burden. Additionally， we perform ATAC-seq to assess changes in chromatin accessibility hat correlate with LN metastasis. We also perform scRNA-seq on dissociated LNs from mice with and without LN metastases.,mRNA profiles were generated from 30 cell lines derived from the various LN lines and parental. The parental was sequenced in triplicate where each replicate was harvested at distinct passage numbers to account for variability in the profile due to culture. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to a depth of 50M reads. Following quality filtering， transcript abundance was quantified using Salmon and differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. LN lines from later generations were compared to the parental or early generation lines.For WES， 10 cell lines were analyzed. These data are accessible directly from SRA at Accession PRJNA820881.For ATAC-seq， 3 samples each from parental， LN3， and LN7 generations were analyzed.For scRNAseq， a LN from tumor naive， parental (non-metastatic) tumor， and LN6 (LN-metastatic) tumor mice each were analyzed.,nan,

Disruption of a GATA2， TAL1， ERG regulatory circuit promotes erythroid transition in healthy and leukemic stem cells [RNA-seq],GSE158795,Homo sapiens,Blood production is maintained through adult life by haematopoietic stem cells which undergo a process of differentiation and increasing lineage restriction to produce all the terminal blood types. The cell type transitions within this process are tightly controlled， and loss of control can lead to inappropriate proliferation and leukemic transformation. We and others have previously described seven transcriptional regulators (heptad; LYL1， TAL1， LMO2， FLI1， ERG， GATA2， RUNX1) which bind key haematopoietic genes in normal human CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Heptad factors form a densely interconnected circuit by binding combinatorically at their own， and each otherâs， regulatory elements. However， the precise role of the heptad throughout normal and leukemic haematopoiesis， including whether all seven factors act together in single cells， and whether heptad perturbation can influence cell fate decisions remain unclear. In this study we integrate bulk and single cell data in normal human HSPCs and leukemic cells and find that chromatin conformation at key heptad regulatory elements is predictive of cell identity in normal and leukemic progenitors. The interconnected heptad circuit identified in normal HSPCs persists in AML， but single cell transcriptomics suggest that specific heptad sub-circuits exist in individual cells， and we show that GATA2， TAL1 and ERG play key roles in regulating the stem to erythroid transition in both normal and leukemic contexts.,RNAseq of primary human CD34+ HSPCs lentivirally transduced with shRNAs targetting luciferse (control) or ERG.,34075404,Blood
Robust single-cell discovery of RNA targets of RNA binding proteins and ribosomes,GSE155729,Homo sapiens,RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of gene expression and RNA processing that are required for gene function. Yet， the dynamics of RBP regulation in single cells is unknown. To address this gap in understanding， we developed STAMP (Surveying Targets by APOBEC Mediated Profiling)， which efficiently detects RBP-RNA interactions. STAMP does not rely on UV-crosslinking or immunoprecipitation and， when coupled with single-cell capture， can identify RBP- and cell type-specific RNA-protein interactions for multiple RBPs and cell types in single-pooled experiments. Pairing STAMP with long-read sequencing also yields RBP target sites for full-length isoforms.

Pancreatic Ppy-expressing gamma-cells display mixed phenotypic traits and adaptive plasticity to engage insulin production,GSE156665,Mus musculus,The cellular identity of pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy)-expressing Î³-cells， the rarest pancreatic islet cell-type， remains elusive. Within islets， glucagon and somatostatin， released respectively from Î±- and Î´-cells， modulate the secretion of insulin by Î²-cells. Dysregulation of insulin production raises blood glucose levels， leading to diabetes onset. Here， we present the genetic signature of human and mouse Î³-cells. Using newly developed tools， we identified a set of genes and pathways defining their functional identity. We found that the Î³-cell population is heterogeneous， with subsets of cells producing another hormone in addition to Ppy. These bihormonal cells share identity markers typical of the other islet cell-types. In mice， Ppy gene inactivation or conditional Î³-cell ablation did not alter glycemia nor body weight. Interestingly， upon Î²-cell injury induction， Î³-cells exhibited gene expression changes and some of them engaged insulin production， like Î±- and Î´-cells. In conclusion， we provide a comprehensive characterization of Î³-cells and highlight their plasticity and therapeutic potential.,Transcriptomic profile of pancreatic Ppy-expressing cells using single cell and bulk RNA-seqProfile the transcriptomic landscape of Ppy-expressing cells and compare it to the other pancreatic endocrine cell types.RNA-seq of sorted alpha， beta， delta and gamma-cells from multiple transgenic mouse models.**Please note that the alpha and beta-cell data was downloaded from the accession number is GSE155519.

Chromatin-directed proteomics-identified network of endogenous androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells,GSE136016,Homo sapiens,Treatment of prostate cancer confronts resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies. AR-associated coregulators and chromatin proteins hold a great potential for novel therapy targets. Here， we employed a powerful chromatin-directed proteomics approach termed ChIP-SICAP to uncover the composition of chromatin protein network， the chromatome， around endogenous AR in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. In addition to several expected AR coregulators， the chromatome contained many nuclear proteins not previously associated with the AR. In the context of androgen signaling in CRPC cells， we further investigated the role of a known AR-associated protein， a chromatin remodeler SMARCA4 and that of SIM2， a transcription factor without a previous association with AR. To understand their role in chromatin accessibility and AR target gene expression， we integrated data from ChIP-seq， RNA-seq， ATAC-seq and functional experiments. Despite the wide co-occurrence of SMARCA4 and AR on chromatin， depletion of SMARCA4 influenced chromatin accessibility and expression of a restricted set of AR target genes， especially those involved in cell morphogenetic changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The depletion also inhibited the CRPC cell growth， validating its functional role in CRPC cells. Although silencing of SIM2 reduced chromatin accessibility similarly， it affected the expression of a much larger group of androgen-regulated genes， including those involved in cellular responses to external stimuli and steroid hormone stimulus. The silencing also reduced proliferation of CRPC cells and tumor size in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay， further emphasizing the importance of SIM2 in CRPC cells and pointing to the functional relevance of this potential prostate cancer biomarker in CRPC cells. Overall， the chromatome of AR identified in this work is an important resource for the field focusing on this important drug target.,Examination of AR， and SMARCA4 binding by ChIP-seq from VCaP prostate cancer cells， in biological duplicates.

Methylation of Dual Specificity Phosphatase 4 Controls Cell Differentiation,GSE174261,Homo sapiens,Mitogen-activated protein kinases are inactivated by dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)， whose activities are tightly regulated during cell differentiation. Using knockdown screening and single-cell transcriptional analysis， we determined that DUSP4 is the phosphatase that specifically inactivates p38 kinase for the promotion of megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation. Mechanistically， PRMT1-mediated methylation of DUSP4 triggers its ubiquitinylation by an E3 ligase HUWE1. Interestingly， the mechanistic axis of the DUSP4 degradation and p38 activation is also associated with a transcriptional signature of immune activation in Mk cells. In the context of thrombocytopenia observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)， we demonstrated that high levels of p38 MAPK and PRMT1 are associated with low platelet counts and adverse prognosis， while pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or PRMT1 stimulates megakaryopoiesis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the PRMT1-DUSP4-p38 axis on Mk differentiation and present a targeting strategy for treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.,Human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells were cultured in a prestimulation medium (IMDM + 20% BIT + Basic Cytokine Mix: 100 ng/mL SCF， 20 ng/mL TPO， 100 ng/mL FLT3 Ligand and 50 ng/mL IL-6) for four days and examined for the surface markers CD41a/CD42b before processing for scRNA-seq. For un-stimulated cells (Sample 1 in Figure 4)， approximately 100，000 cells were harvested.

On Day 8 poststimulation， approximately 100，000 cells were collected as TPO/SCF-stimulated cells (Sample 2 in Figure 4).  FACS sorting of the TPO/SCF-stimulated cells allowed the collection of approximately 88，000 TPO/SCF-stimulated， CD41a+CD42b+ cells (Sample 4 in Figure 4) and 100，000 TPO/SCF-stimulated， non-CD41a+CD42b+ cells (Sample 3 in Figure 4).

An ultra high-throughput method for single-cell joint analysis of open chromatin and transcriptome,GSE130399,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Simultaneous profiling of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility within single cells is a powerful approach to dissect gene regulatory programs in complex tissues. However， the current tools are limited by modest throughput. We now describe an ultra high-throughput method， Paired-seq， for parallel analysis of transcriptome and accessible chromatin in millions of single cells. We demonstrate the utility of Paired-seq for analyzing the dynamic and cell-type specific gene regulatory programs in complex tissues， by applying it to mouse adult cerebral cortex and fetal forebrain. The joint profiles of a large number of single cells allowed us to deconvolute the transcriptome and open chromatin landscapes in the major cell types within these brain tissues， infer putative target genes of candidate enhancers， and reconstruct the trajectory of cellular lineages within the developing forebrain.*** Processed files of brain cells can be downloaded from:https://github.com/cxzhu/Paired-seq/tree/master/matrices/- Compressed files for cell-gene/bin-counts matrices of Adult Cerebral Cortex cells only.- Compressed files for cell-gene/bin-counts matrices of merged Fetal and Adult brain cells.- Metadata files of sequenced cells are inside the compressed files.- Cluster/Ident to Annotation information available from the GitHub page.,Combined analysis of RNA and accessible chromatin in single-cells.,31695190,Nat Struct Mol Biol
Distal and proximal cis-regulatory elements sense X-dosage and developmental state at the Xist locus,GSE167358,Mus musculus;synthetic construct,Developmental genes such as Xist， the master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)， are controlled by complex cis-regulatory landscapes， which decode multiple signals to establish specific spatio-temporal expression patterns. Xist integrates information on X-chromosomal dosage and developmental stage to trigger XCI at the primed pluripotent state in females only. Through a pooled CRISPR interference screen in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells， we identify functional enhancer elements of Xist during the onset of random XCI. By quantifying how enhancer activity is modulated by X-dosage and differentiation， we find that X-dosage controls the promoter-proximal region in a binary switch-like manner. By contrast， differentiation cues activate a series of distal elements and bring them into closer spatial proximity of the Xist promoter. The strongest distal element is part of an enhancer cluster ~200 kb upstream of the Xist gene which is associated with a previously unannotated Xist-enhancing regulatory transcript， we named Xert. Developmental cues and X-dosage are thus decoded by distinct regulatory regions， which cooperate to ensure female-specific Xist upregulation at the correct developmental time. Our study is the first step to disentangle how multiple， functionally distinct regulatory regions interact to generate complex expression patterns in mammals.,Refer to individual Series,34932975,Mol Cell
An epigenetic program established by gene â environment interactions initiates pancreatic carcinogenesis [scATAC-Seq],GSE137069,Mus musculus,Damaged tissues have increased risk of cancer development through poorly understood mechanisms. For example， in the pancreas， tissue damage collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to dramatically accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and， ultimately， pancreatic cancer. By integrating genomics， single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally-controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous tumor models， we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a functionally relevant chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is inherited throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges remarkably fast， involves chromatin accessibility changes not induced by pancreatic injury alone， and contributes to the early activation of neoplasia specific genes that define advanced human pancreatic cancer. Among the genes activated by injury-facilitated chromatin reprogramming are a series of known and novel cancer-related factors， including the alarmin cytokine IL33， which cooperates with mutant Kras in driving neoplastic transformation in the absence of tissue damage. Collectively， our study demonstrates how gene-environment interactions can rapidly produce gene regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment and provides a molecular framework for understanding the cooperation between genetics and environmental cues in cancer initiation.,Characterization of single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles of lineage-traced pancreatic epithelial cells isolated directly by FACS-sorting (mKate2+) from early neoplastic pancreatic tissues: To assess the effects of tissue injury in mutant Kras-expressing pancreata， lineage-traced (mKate2+) pancreatic epithelial cells were sorted from KC;RIK (p48-Cre;RIK;LSLKrasG12D) littermate male mice treated with caerulein or PBS (vehicle control) at 5 weeks of age.,33536616,Nature

Identification of the stress granule transcriptome via RNA-editing in bulk S2 cells， single S2 cells and in Drosophila neurons,GSE175782,Drosophila melanogaster,"Stress granules are phase separated assemblies formed around mRNAs that have now been identified after stress granule purification from cell culture. Here， we present a purification free method to detect stress granules RNAs in single cells and in tissues， including those displaying cell heterogeneity. We adapted TRIBE (Target of RNA-binding proteins Identified by Editing) to detect stress-granule RNAs by fusing a stress-granule RNA-binding protein (FMR1) to the catalytic domain of an RNA-editing enzyme (ADAR). RNAs colocalized with this fusion are edited， producing mutations that are detectable by sequencing. We then show that this âin situ"" method can reliably identify stress granule RNAs in single S2 cells and in Drosophila neurons， and that they encode cell cycle， transcription and splicing factors. The identification of stress granule RNAs without perturbation opens the possibility to examine cell-to-cell variability and identify the RNA content not only in stress granules， but also in other RNA based assemblies in single cells derived from tissues.",7 samples of bulk S2 cells are analyzed， which include a non-induced sample (no expression of ADAR)， 3 replicates of induced + Schneider's (basal condition) and 3 replicates of induced + arsenite (stress condition).  7 samples of Drosophila brain cells are analyzed， which include a non-induced sample (no expression of ADAR)， 3 replicates of induced + Schneider's (basal condition) and 3 replicates of induced + arsenite (stress condition).  2 384-well plates are analyzed， which contain single S2 cells in each well treated with either induced + Schneider's (basal condition) or induced + arsenite (stress condition),35784648,Cell Rep Methods

Vector-borne Trypanosoma brucei parasites develop and persist in artificial human skin as skin tissue forms,GSE174198,Trypanosoma brucei;Homo sapiens,Transmission of Trypanosoma brucei by tsetse flies involves the deposition of the infective quiescent metacyclic stage into the mammalian skin at the site of the flyâs bite. In the skin， the metacyclic parasites reactivate and differentiate into proliferative trypanosomes before colonizing the host's blood and tissues. We have generated an advanced human skin equivalent and used tsetse flies to naturally infect the artificial skin with trypanosomes. We have detailed the chronological order of the parasites' development in the skin and found a rapid activation and differentiation of the tsetse-transmitted cell cycleâarrested metacyclic trypanosomes to proliferative parasites. Single-parasite transcriptomics documented the biological events during differentiation and host invasion at five different time points. After the establishment of a proliferative trypanosome population in the skin， the parasites entered a reversible quiescence program characterized by slow replication and a strongly reduced metabolism. We termed these quiescent trypanosomes skin tissue forms (STF)， which may play an important role in maintaining the trypanosome infection in aparasitemic， asymptomatic individuals.,After natural infection， skin equivalents were cultured for another 4 h， 12 h， 24 h， and 7 d， respectively. In addition， freshly collected MCFs obtained from tsetse flies were used. Skin equivalents were dissociated and single viable parasites were sorted based on their tdTomato and Calcein AM signal with a FACSAria III cytometer (BD Biosciences) into 48-well plates containing 2.6 Âµl of 1x lysis buffer (Takara) supplemented with 0.01 Âµl of RNase inhibitor (40 U/Âµl; Takara). Immediately after sorting， cells were placed on ice for 5 min and stored at -80 Â°C. Library preparation and sequencing was carried out as described previously (Muller et al.， 2018).

Epigenome editing strategies for the functional annotation of topological insulators,GSE121998,Homo sapiens,The human genome is folded into regulatory units termed âtopologically-associated domainsâ (TADs)， within which the majority of gene-enhancer interactions occur. Genome-wide studies support a global role for the insulator protein CTCF in mediating chromosomal looping and the topological constraint of TAD boundaries3，4. However， the impact of individual insulators on enhancer-gene interactions and transcription remains poorly understood. Here， we investigate epigenome editing strategies for perturbing individual CTCF insulators and evaluating consequent effects on genome topology and transcription. We show that fusions of catalytically-inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to transcriptional repressors (dCas9-KRAB) and DNA methyltransferases (dCas9-DNMT3A， dCas9-DNMT3A3L) can selectively displace CTCF from specific insulators， but only when precisely targeted to the cognate motif. We further demonstrate that stable， mitotically-heritable insulator disruption can be achieved through combinatorial hit-and-run epigenome editing with dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-DNMT3A3L. Finally， we apply these strategies to activate PDGFRA expression in glioblastoma stem cells， thus simulating an insulator loss mechanism implicated in brain tumorigenesis. Our study provides strategies for stably modifying genome organization and gene activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence.,ChIP-seq， BS-seq， and 4C-seq experiments from HEK293 and GSC6 cells following targeted epigenome editing*** The raw sequencing/alignment data for cell line GSC6 [GSM3937048-GSM3937067] are not provided due to patient confidentiality.,31534142,Nat Commun
Disruption of a GATA2， TAL1， ERG regulatory circuit promotes erythroid transition in healthy and leukemic stem cells [ChIP-seq],GSE158794,Homo sapiens,Blood production is maintained through adult life by haematopoietic stem cells which undergo a process of differentiation and increasing lineage restriction to produce all the terminal blood types. The cell type transitions within this process are tightly controlled， and loss of control can lead to inappropriate proliferation and leukemic transformation. We and others have previously described seven transcriptional regulators (heptad; LYL1， TAL1， LMO2， FLI1， ERG， GATA2， RUNX1) which bind key haematopoietic genes in normal human CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Heptad factors form a densely interconnected circuit by binding combinatorically at their own， and each otherâs， regulatory elements. However， the precise role of the heptad throughout normal and leukemic haematopoiesis， including whether all seven factors act together in single cells， and whether heptad perturbation can influence cell fate decisions remain unclear. In this study we integrate bulk and single cell data in normal human HSPCs and leukemic cells and find that chromatin conformation at key heptad regulatory elements is predictive of cell identity in normal and leukemic progenitors. The interconnected heptad circuit identified in normal HSPCs persists in AML， but single cell transcriptomics suggest that specific heptad sub-circuits exist in individual cells， and we show that GATA2， TAL1 and ERG play key roles in regulating the stem to erythroid transition in both normal and leukemic contexts.,ChIPseq of transcription factors and histone modifications in ME-1 and KG-1 acute myeloid leukemia cells,34075404,Blood

High-content single-cell combinatorial indexing,GSE174226,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We describe a new generalizable library generation chemistry with increased efficiency that is  amendable to tagmentation-based split-pool barcoding strategies， such as single-cell combinatorial indexing (sci). Symmetrical strand sci (âs3â) uses a novel uracil-based adapter switching approach that provides an improved rate of conversion of source DNA into viable sequencing library fragments following tagmentation. We apply this chemistry to assay chromatin accessibility (s3-ATAC) to profile human cortical and mouse whole brain tissues， with mouse datasets demonstrating a 6-to-13-fold improvement in usable reads obtained per cell when compared to other available methods performed on the same sample type. We also demonstrate the generalizability of s3 by applying it to single-cell whole genome sequencing (s3-WGS)， and whole genome plus chromatin conformation (s3-GCC)， for structural variant calling in a patient-derived cancer cell line model. Using the high-coverage profiles produced by the s3 technologies we characterized preserved clonal structure and identified a putative subclone-specific translocation.,s3-ATAC was performed on two samples， a flash-frozen mouse whole brain and a flash-frozen human cortex sample. Library generation was performed as a barnyard with an equimolar mix of human and mouse nuclei at various steps. Cross-species nuclei were mixed either prior to tagmentation， after tagmentation， or kept isolated. See Fig2a in our manuscript or metadata files for more details.For s3-WGS and s3-GCC data， was performed on patient derived cell lines (PDCLs) and GM12878. Processed files are supplied. s3-WGS data is supplied as a read count per bin (s3-GCC read count data is included) as well as a bed format of read alignment location. s3-GCC data is supplied as a pairix format file with distal contacts information.,34226710,Nat Biotechnol

ALKBH7-mediated demethylation regulates mitochondrial  polycistronic RNA processing,GSE148202,Homo sapiens,Members of the mammalian AlkB family are known to mediate nucleic acid demethylation. ALKBH7， a mammalian AlkB homologue， localizes in mitochondria (mt) and affects metabolism， but its function and mechanism of action are unknown. Here， we report an approach to site-specifically detect m1A， m3C， m1G， and m22G modifications simultaneously within all cellular RNAs， and discovered that human ALKBH7 demethylates N2， N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G) and N1-methyladenosine (m1A) within mt-Ile and mt-Leu1 pre-tRNA regions， respectively， in nascent polycistronic mt-RNA. We further show that ALKBH7 regulates the processing and structural dynamics of polycistronic mt-RNAs. Depletion of ALKBH7 leads to increased polycistronic mt-RNA processing， reduced steady-state mitochondria-encoded tRNA levels and protein translation， as well as notably decreased mitochondrial activity. Thus， we identify ALKBH7 as an RNA demethylase that controls nascent mt-RNA processing and mitochondrial activity.,[dataset1] 4 samples (Sample 1-4): Duplicates for DAMM-seq of cellular small RNA samples from HepG2 cells， including RNA input and Engineered-AlkB-treated.[dataset2] 12 samples (Sample 13-24): Duplicates for DAMM-seq of mitochondrial tRNA samples to observe methylation fraction change in vivo， including siALKBH7 vs. siControl， shTRMT1 vs. shControl and o/e ALKBH7 vs. o/e Control in HepG2 and HeLa cell lines.[dataset3] 16 samples (Sample 25-40): Duplicates for DAMM-seq of mitochondrial dsRNA samples to observe methylation fraction change in vivo， including siALKBH7 vs. siControl， ALKBH7 wild-type vs. ALKBH7 knockout， shTRMT1 vs. shControl and o/e ALKBH7 vs. o/e Control in HepG2 and HeLa cell lines.[dataset4] 8 samples (Sample 41-48): Duplicates for icSHAPE of mitochondrial dsRNA samples to observe flexible regions within dsRNA in vivo， including input and pulldown samples for siALKBH7 vs. siControl in HepG2 cells.[dataset5] 6 samples (Sample 49-54): Duplicates for DAMM-seq of HepG2 dsRNA samples to observe methylation fraction change in vivo， including siALKBH7+empty vector， siALKBH7+ALKBH7-WT and siALKBH7+ALKBH7-mutant.[dataset6] 12 samples (Sample 55-66): Duplicates for DAMM-seq of HepG2 EU-labeled RNA samples to observe mt-mRNA and junction level change in vivo， including 10-min EU-labeled RNA from siALKBH7 vs. siControl， 10-min EU-labeled RNA from wild-type vs. ALKBH7 KO HepG2 cells， 20-min EU-labeled RNA from wild-type HepG2 cells and 30-min EU-labeled RNA from wild-type HepG2 cells.,34253897,Nat Cell Biol

Molecular basis for substrate recruitment to the PRMT5 methylosome,GSE177036,Homo sapiens,PRMT5 is an essential arginine methyltransferase and a therapeutic target in MTAP null cancers. PRMT5 utilizes adaptor proteins for substrate recruitment through a previously undefined mechanism. Here， we identify an evolutionarily conserved peptide sequence shared among the three known substrate adaptors (CLNS1A， RIOK1 and COPR5) and show it is necessary and sufficient for interaction with PRMT5. We demonstrate that PRMT5 uses modular adaptor proteins containing a common binding motif for substrate recruitment， comparable to other enzyme classes such as kinases and E3 ligases. We structurally resolve the interface with PRMT5 and show via genetic perturbation that it is required for methylation of adaptor-recruited substrates including the spliceosome， histones， and ribosome assembly complexes. Further， disruption of this site affects Sm spliceosome stability and activity， leading to intron retention. Genetic disruption of the PRMT5-substrate adaptor interface leads to a hypomorphic decrease in growth of MTAP null tumor cells in vitro and in vivo， and is thus a novel site for development of therapeutic inhibitors of PRMT5.,2 experimental conditions (WT or ADA treatment)， in triplicate， of human HCT116 tumor cells.Please note that the published GSM2462895-GSM2462900 (in GSE93813) data has been re-analyzed as below and the re-analyzed 'prev_publish_*txt' data (is linked as Series supplementary files:The fastq files from the above mentioned previously published data was processed using rMATS turbo v4.1.1 with read length as 75 and gencode.v19.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf gtf file to create tab delimited files recording events observed for each of the different alternate splicing events among the replicates and comparing them across the DMSO and EPZ015666 scenarios.

Hoxb8-FL cell line is a model system of lympho-myeloid progenitors， which self-renews in vitro and is amenable to genetic perturbations. To construct a functionally defined transcription factor (TF) network we targeted 39 transcription factors using CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting in Hoxb8-FL cells. We measured the resulting transcriptional changes by small scale RNA-Seq within 2-4 d of each perturbation. Our network analysis revealed >17，000 TF-target interactions across >7，000 target genes， established new interactions among TFs and shed new light on the mechanisms maintaining self-renewal and multipotency.,RNA-Seq profiles of Hoxb8-FL cells with CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations against 39 TFs. Samples are organised in plates as indicated， each plate contains samples corresponding to 3 targeted TFs， each with 3 sgRNAs and 2-3 sets of controls (either non-targeting sgRNA or sgRNA targeting the Rosa26 locus). Each condition was performed in 8 replicates. Additionally， 8 replicates were added for Hoxb8-FL cells 16 h after switching off Hoxb8 expression. Additionally， we provide ChIP data for 16 TFs and H3K27Ac histome modification.,33103827,EMBO J

Functional single-cell genomics of human cytomegalovirus infection,GSE165291,Homo sapiens;Human herpesvirus 5 strain Merlin,The complex life cycle of herpesviruses is orchestrated by the interplay of host factors and hundreds of viral genes. Understanding how they work together and how perturbations of viral and host factors impact infection represents both a fundamental problem in virology and the basis for designing antiviral interventions. Here， we use CRISPR screening to study infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in primary cells， comprehensively defining the functional contribution of each viral and host factor. We then record the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of single cells， and monitor how genetic perturbation of critical host and viral factors alters the timing， course， and progression of infection. We find that normally， the large majority of cells follow a stereotypical transcriptional trajectory. Perturbing critical host factors does not change this trajectory per se， but can either stall， delay or accelerate progression along the trajectory， allowing us to pinpoint systematically the stage of infection at which each host factor acts. Conversely， perturbation of viral factors can create distinct abortive trajectories. Our results reveal a dichotomy between the roles of host and viral factors and more generally provide a road map for functional dissection of host-pathogen interactions.,This repository includes six individual experiments， all conducted in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).

Tcf1 controls Treg functions that regulate inflammation， CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity， and severity of colon cancer,GSE163084,Mus musculus,Tcf1， the DNA-binding partner of Î²-catenin， is essential for the development and function of T regulatory cells (Tregs). However， how Tcf1 regulates Treg functional specification is less understood. Here， we ablated Tcf1 in Tregs to elucidate its role in Treg specification in healthy mice and mice with colon cancer. RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq revealed that Tcf1 deficient Tregs maintain their core transcriptional signature and diversity， but promote T-cell receptor， TgfÎ² receptor， TH17， and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathways. Central-memory-Tregs with low Klf2 and effector-Tregs with high Mif expression gain TH17 characteristics and mature into effector Treg subpopulations that strongly express cMaf. Tcf1 deficient Tregs exhibit enhanced suppression of T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity but are compromised in controlling CD4+ T-cell polarization and inflammation. In mice with polyposis， Tcf1 deficient Tregs promote inflammation and tumor growth. Thus， Tcf1 determines Treg functions that regulate TH17 inflammation and the course and outcome of colorectal cancer.,CD25+YFP+ Tregs were FACS sorted from MACS-pre-purified CD4+ T cells (mouse CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit， Miltenyi) isolated from MLN of Foxp3Cre and Foxp3CreTcf7fl/fl mice. Total RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus) following the manufacturerâs instructions. Libraries were generated and sequenced by the University of Chicago Genomics Facility. Samples from Foxp3Cre and Foxp3CreTcf7fl/fl mice are prepared and sequenced in triplicates. Whole live cells were washed twice in 1x PBS + 0.04% BSA and immediately submitted to the Core for Single Cell sorting. For single-cell RNAseq， the cells were first counted and measured for viability using the Vi-Cell XR Cell Viability Analyzer (Beckman-Coulter)， as well as a basic hemocytometer with light microscopy. The barcoded Gel Beads were thawed from -80C and the reverse transcription master mix was prepared according to the manufactureâs instruction for Chromium Single Cell 3â v2 library kit (10x Genomics).

Durable Suppression of Acquired MEK Inhibitor Resistance in Cancer by Sequestering MEK from ERK and Promoting Anti-Tumor T-cell Immunity [single-cell RNA-seq],GSE158609,Mus musculus,Disruption of the MAPK pathway in cancer by kinase inhibition often fails due to pathway reactivation， causing clinical relapse. Among MAPK inhibitors， type I RAF inhibitors are only active against specific BRAF mutants; MEK inhibitor monotherapy is associated with limited clinical benefits but may serve as a foundation for combinatorial therapy. Here， we show that type II RAF plus allosteric MEK inhibitors durably blunt the development of acquired MEK inhibitor resistance among cancers with KRAS， NRAS， NF1， BRAFnon-V600 and BRAFV600 mutations， when compared to a combination of type II RAF plus ERK inhibitors. Type II RAF and MEK (versus ERK) inhibitors also display superior capacity to sequester MEK in RAF complexes and uncouple MEK and ERK interaction in acquired resistant tumor subpopulations. Systemically and intratumorally， type II RAF plus MEK inhibitors expand memory and activated/exhausted CD8+ T-cells. Whereas trametinib alone temporally reduces dominant intra-tumoral T-cell clones， type II RAF inhibitor co-treatment reverses this effect and promotes T-cell clonotypic expansion and convergence. Importantly， durably control of tumors by this combination requires CD8+ T-cells. Thus， the prolonged anti-tumor efficacy of type II RAF plus MEK inhibitors reveals exquisite MAPK addiction in common lethal cancer histologies， and the mechanisms include unexpected allosteric perturbation of the MAPK pathway and engagement of anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell immunity.,This dataset contains single cell transcriptomes of the murine melanoma cell line (Nras mutated) with/without combination treatment of Trametinib and BGB-283 using 10x Genomics single cell RNA-Seq.The Nras mutated melanoma model was derived from a Nras Q61R murine syngeneic melanoma cell line NIL， and has been exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to introduce mutational burden equivalent to human melanoma.,33318037,Cancer Discov

A complex regulatory landscape involved in the development of external genitals [RNA-Seq],GSE138511,Mus musculus,In vertebrates， developmental genes are often controlled by large regulatory landscapes matching the dimensions of topologically associating domains (TADs). In various ontogenic contexts， the associated constitutive chromatin backbone is modified by fine-tuned specific variations in enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-promoter interaction profiles. In this work， we use a TAD flanking the HoxD gene cluster as a paradigm to address the question of how these complex regulatory architectures are formed and how they are de-constructed once their function has been achieved. We suggest that this TAD can be considered as a coherent functional unit in itself， with several regulatory sequences acting together to elicit a transcriptional response. With one notable exception， the deletion of each of these sequences in isolation did not produce any substantial modification in the global transcriptional outcome of the system， a result at odds with a conventional view of long-range enhancer function. Likewise， both the deletion and inversion of a CTCF site located in a region rich in such sequences did not affect transcription of the target gene. In the latter case， however， slight modifications were observed in interaction profiles in vivo in agreement with the loop extrusion model， despite no apparent functional consequences. We discuss these unexpected results by considering both conventional explanations and an alternative possibility whereby a rather unspecific accumulation of particular factors within the TAD backbone may have a global impact upon transcription.,RNA-seq analysis of genital tubercle tissue from E16.5 and E18.5 mouse embryos,32301703,Elife

Disruption of a GATA2， TAL1， ERG regulatory circuit promotes erythroid transition in healthy and leukemic stem cells [scRNA-seq],GSE158796,Homo sapiens,Blood production is maintained through adult life by haematopoietic stem cells which undergo a process of differentiation and increasing lineage restriction to produce all the terminal blood types. The cell type transitions within this process are tightly controlled， and loss of control can lead to inappropriate proliferation and leukemic transformation. We and others have previously described seven transcriptional regulators (heptad; LYL1， TAL1， LMO2， FLI1， ERG， GATA2， RUNX1) which bind key haematopoietic genes in normal human CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Heptad factors form a densely interconnected circuit by binding combinatorically at their own， and each otherâs， regulatory elements. However， the precise role of the heptad throughout normal and leukemic haematopoiesis， including whether all seven factors act together in single cells， and whether heptad perturbation can influence cell fate decisions remain unclear. In this study we integrate bulk and single cell data in normal human HSPCs and leukemic cells and find that chromatin conformation at key heptad regulatory elements is predictive of cell identity in normal and leukemic progenitors. The interconnected heptad circuit identified in normal HSPCs persists in AML， but single cell transcriptomics suggest that specific heptad sub-circuits exist in individual cells， and we show that GATA2， TAL1 and ERG play key roles in regulating the stem to erythroid transition in both normal and leukemic contexts.,Single cell RNAseq of unperturbed ME-1 AML cells (DSMZ cat# ACC 537),34075404,Blood

Phase separation of RNA-binding protein promotes polymerase binding and transcription,GSE150399,Mus musculus,An RNA-involved phase-separation model has been proposed for transcription control. Yet， the molecular links that connect RNA to the transcription machinery remain missing. Here we find RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) constitute half of the chromatin proteome in embryonic stem cells (ESCs)， and some are colocalized with RNA polymerase (Pol) II at promoters and enhancers. Biochemical analyses of representative RBPs show that the paraspeckle protein PSPC1 inhibits the RNA-induced premature release of Pol II， and  makes use of RNA as multivalent molecules to enhance the formation of transcription condensates and subsequent phosphorylation and release of Pol II. This synergistic interplay enhances polymerase engagement and activity via the RNA-binding and phase-separation activities of PSPC1. In ESCs， auxin-induced acute degradation of PSPC1 leads to genome-wide defects in Pol II binding and nascent transcription. We propose that promoter-associated RNAs and their binding proteins synergize the phase separation of polymerase condensates to promote active transcription.,Pol II ChIP-seq and TT-seq were used to chracterize the changes of Ser5 or Ser2 phosphorylated Pol II occupancy and transcription rate upon PSPC1 acute degradation. RBP ChIP-seq were used to charaterize the binding of different RBPs on chromatin. Pol II ChIP-seqs rescued with different forms of PSPC1 proteins were used to characterize whether the changes of Ser2 phosphorylated Pol II occupancy upon PSPC1 acute degradation is dependent on PSPC1 protein. ChIP-seqs of PSPC1 mutants were used to charaterize the binding of different PSPC1 mutants on chromatin. PSPC1 CLIP-seq was used to detect RNA targets of PSPC1. EU-seq was used to detect change of transcription level upon PSPC1 acute depletion.,nan,

A Hedgehog-FGF signaling axis patterns anterior mesoderm during gastrulation,GSE149335,Mus musculus,Single cell technologies hold promise for resolving complex early developmental phenotypes. Here we define a novel Hedgehog (Hh)-Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling axis for the formation of anterior mesoderm lineages during gastrulation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Hh-deficient mesoderm revealed selective deficits in anterior mesoderm populationsâculminating in defects to anterior embryonic structures including the pharyngeal arches， heart， and anterior somites. Transcriptional profiling of Hh-deficient mesoderm during gastrulation revealed disruptions to both transcriptional patterning of the mesoderm and FGF signaling for mesoderm migration. Mesoderm-specific Fgf4/Fgf8 double mutants recapitulated anterior mesoderm defects and Hh-dependent GLI transcription factors modulated enhancers at FGF gene loci.Â  Cellular migration defects during gastrulation induced by Hh pathway antagonism were mitigated by FGF4 protein. These findings implicate a multicomponent signaling hierarchy activated by Hh ligands from the embryonic node and executed by FGF signals in nascent mesoderm to control anterior mesoderm patterning.,Comparing the cellular composition of Mesp1Cre sorted E8.25 mesoderm between Wt embryos and embryos expressing a dominant negative Hh pathway transcriptional repressor (Gli3R).,32561646,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

Comparative RNA-Seq analysis reveals potentially resistance-related genes in response to Bacterial canker of tomato,GSE152330,Solanum lycopersicum;Solanum arcanum,Tomato is one of the most important crops for human consumption. Unfortunately， its production is affected by diseases caused by pathogens such as the actynomicete Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganens (Cmm). This pathogen is the causal agent of the bacterial canker of tomato， considered one of the most devastating tomato diseases. To date， there are not resistant varieties of commercial tomato against Cmm. However， there are wild tomato species resistant to Cmm. Using massive sequencing， we obtained the transcriptomes of the wild tomato species Solanum arcanum LA2157 and the commercial tomato Solanum lycopersicum cv. Ailsa Craig at 8 and 24 hours after Cmm challenge. We identified potential tomato tolerance-related genes by three approaches: mapping the reads to S. lycopersicum reference genome SL3.0， performing a semi de novo transcriptome assembly and a de novo transcriptome assembly. Some functional groups such as oxylipin biosynthetic process response to wounding， response to cytokinin among others， were enriched in both tomato species， suggesting a similar response， however， genes that encode proteins such as the Polyphenol oxidase E， Ankyrin and Leucine Rich Repeat receptors were overexpressed mainly in the wild tomato species， suggesting a possible role in the defense response. Here， we uncovered new candidate genes potentially related to bacterial canker tomato defense.,Comparison of two Solanum species， wild type and commercial， during 24 hours post-infection with Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm).,34828351,Genes (Basel)

Native molecule sequencing by nano-ID reveals synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms,GSE127890,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct,Eukaryotic genes often generate a variety of RNA isoforms that can lead to functionally distinct protein variants. The synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms is however poorly characterized. The reason for this is that current methods to quantify RNA metabolism use short-read sequencing that cannot detect RNA isoforms. Here we present nanopore sequencing-based Isoform Dynamics (nano-ID)， a method that detects newly synthesized RNA isoforms and monitors isoform metabolism. nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling， long-read nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules and machine learning. nano-ID derived RNA stability estimates enable a distinctive evaluation of stability determining factors such as sequence， poly(A)-tail length， RNA secondary structure， translation efficiency and RNA binding proteins. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their stability. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.,Direct RNA nanopore sequencing in human cells,32887688,Genome Res

A single-cell transcriptomics CRISPR-activation screen identifies new epigenetic regulators of the zygotic genome activation programme (bulk RNA-seq of E14 and SAM mESCs dataset),GSE135509,Mus musculus,Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is a crucial developmental milestone that remains poorly understood. This first essential transcriptional event in embryonic development coincides with extensive epigenetic reprogramming and is orchestrated， in part， by the interplay of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. Here， we developed a novel high-throughput screening method that combines pooled CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics and applied this method to systematically probe candidate regulators of ZGA-like transcription. We screened 230 epigenetic and transcriptional factors by upregulating their expression with CRISPRa in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)， we generated approximately 200，000 single-cell transcriptomes of CRISPRa-perturbed cells， each transduced with a unique short-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a specific candidate gene promoter. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) of the perturbation scRNA-seq profiles， we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response in ESCs， both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome. We further validated nine candidate genes by arrayed CRISPRa analysed by bulk transcriptomics， which demonstrates that the combination of CRISPRa with scRNA-seq is a powerful and valid approach to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription. Additional cDNA overexpression assays for three top hits， the DNA binding protein Dppa2， the chromatin remodeller Smarca5 and the transcription factor Patz1， confirmed these factors as ZGA-like regulators by alternative methods. Supporting these findings， Dppa2 and Smarca5 knock-out ESCs lose expression of ZGA genes and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5âs regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2.

Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) of the perturbation scRNA-seq profiles， we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response in ESCs， both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome. We further validated nine candidate genes by arrayed CRISPRa analysed by bulk transcriptomics， which demonstrates that the combination of CRISPRa with scRNA-seq is a powerful and valid approach to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription. Additional cDNA overexpression assays for three top hits， the DNA binding protein Dppa2， the chromatin remodeller Smarca5 and the transcription factor Patz1， confirmed these factors as ZGA-like regulators by alternative methods. Supporting these findings， Dppa2 and Smarca5 knock-out ESCs lose expression of ZGA genes and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5âs regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2. Together， our single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPRa-perturbed cells provides comprehensive system-level insights into the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate ZGA.,Bulk RNA-seq of three replicates of E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and two replicates of SAM mESCs.

RNA-Sequencing of drought-stressed leaves of watermelon,GSE144814,Citrullus lanatus,Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare differentially expressed transcripts in leaves of watermelon during drought stress using transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq),Methods: Leaf samples for RNA Seq analysis were collected from three independent plants at 8 days after initiation of drought stress from control (CT1_1， CT1_2， CT1_3) and drought-stressed plants (DT_1， DT_2， DT_3) were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. Results: The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using PE Cluster Kit cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cluster generation， the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform， and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Raw reads of fastq format were processed to obtain clean reads by removing the adapter， reads containing ploy-N， and low quality reads from raw data. At the same time， Q20， Q30， and GC content， the clean data were calculated. Watermelon reference genome (cultivar Charleston Gray) and gene model annotation files were downloaded from CuGenDB (http://cucurbitgenomics.org/). Index of the reference genome was built using Bowtie v2.2.3， and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12. : HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the reads mapped to each gene. Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated from mapped read by featureCounts. Differential expression analysis of control and drought-stressed conditions (three biological replicates per tissue per treatment) was performed using the DESeq R package (1.18.0) (Anders and Huber， 2010). Genes with P-value < 0.05 found by DESeq were assigned as differentially expressed. Conclusions: The transcriptomic changes induced by drought stress in leaf tissue at 8DAT was used for RNA-Seq analysis. A total of six libraries from leaf tissue (CT-1， CT-2， CT-3 for control and DT-1， DT-2， DT-3 for drought stress) were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. On average， 45.53 to 43.47 million raw reads were generated from leaf tissues in both treatments. Across all reads for both control and drought samples， the Q20 and Q30 percentage was more than 98 and 94%， respectively (sequencing error rate was less than 0.02%)， and GC content for the libraries was ~45%.  Among all the libraries， the ratio of total mapped reads was above 97%， of which ~92 % reads uniquely mapped to the reference watermelon genome for control and drought-stressed samples. The data generated from all libraries provided a foundation for quality analyses. The RNA-Seq analysis identified 3971 differentially expressed (p <0.05) genes in the leaf tissue of drought-stressed plants， of which a total of 1513 genes were upregulated and 2458 genes were downregulated.,32431723,Front Plant Sci

A computational framework for identifying promoter sequences in non-model organisms using RNA-seq datasets,GSE162089,Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense,We developed a computational framework to discover short DNA sequences that confer strong expression in non-model organisms. The framework relies solely on whole genome and RNA sequencing data types， which are easily accessible to a variety of research groups. The framework proceeds in three main stages: 1) identification of a group of highly expressed loci that maintain high transcript counts across a broad range of experimental conditions， 2) extraction of the corresponding upstream candidate promoter regions of these highly expressed loci while minding nearby annotations and avoiding those that may potentially reside in operons， and 3) application of the motif finding algorithm in BioProspector to these upstream regions to predict the location and sequence of the -35 and -10 hexamers that drive the strong expression of these loci. Ultimately， we report sequences of 27-30 bases in length as candidate -35， -10 signals for each of the top loci and create a consensus motif from these predictions. We apply our framework to 80 RNA-seq datasets collected for the methanotroph Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense 5GB1 and validate our predictions computationally and experimentally. The data deposited here represent all RNA-seq data that， until this study， has not previously been published.,80 RNA-seq datasets measuring Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense expression across 12 experimental growth conditions were compiled from a previously published data sets， additionally including their associated quality control runs， and several previously unpublished experiments. RNA-seq data were generated from a mix of Illumina protocols using a variety of read lengths (36， 50， and 150 bp) and paired and unpaired libraries. Of these 80 datasets， 24 have been previuosly published and deposited. The remaining 56 samples are deposited here.,33988977,ACS Synth Biol

Identify Tfcp2l1-regulated genes in mouse embryonic stem cells grown in 2i medium,GSE159937,Mus musculus,Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in the 2i (an ERK inhibitor， PD0325901， and a GSK-3b inhibitor， CHIR99021) mimic pluripotent epiblasts in preimplantation blastocysts. ESCs grown in FBS containing medium are more heterogenous in morphology and expression of stem cell factors. Tfcp2l1 is a transcription factor highly expressed in ESCs grown in the 2i medium， suggesting that it plays in important role in ESC biology. To search for the putative role(s) of Tfcp2l1 in ESCs， we plan to use an integrated genomic approach--combing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq--to identify the direct targets of Tfcp2l1 in ESCs. RNA-seq is used to identify the transcripts regulated by Tfcp2l1 in ESCs grown in the 2i medium.,Four repeats for each of the three conditions: 1) Wild type ESCs grown in 2i; 2) Tfcp2l1 knockout ESCs grown in 2i; 3) Wild type ESCs grown in FBS. To identify transcripts regulated by Tfcp2l1 in the 2i medium， compared 1) to 2). To perform GSEA of 2i versus FBS， compare 1) to 3).,33950553,EMBO Rep

Here， we developed a novel high-throughput screening method that combines pooled CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) with single-cell transcriptomics and applied this method to systematically probe candidate regulators of ZGA-like transcription. We screened 230 epigenetic and transcriptional factors by upregulating their expression with CRISPRa in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)， we generated approximately 200，000 single-cell transcriptomes of CRISPRa-perturbed cells， each transduced with a unique short-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a specific candidate gene promoter. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) of the perturbation scRNA-seq profiles， we characterized molecular signatures of ZGA and uncovered 24 factors that promote a ZGA-like response in ESCs， both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome. We further validated nine candidate genes by arrayed CRISPRa analysed by bulk transcriptomics， which demonstrates that the combination of CRISPRa with scRNA-seq is a powerful and valid approach to identify regulators of ZGA-like transcription. Additional cDNA overexpression assays for three top hits， the DNA binding protein Dppa2， the chromatin remodeller Smarca5 and the transcription factor Patz1， confirmed these factors as ZGA-like regulators by alternative methods. Supporting these findings， Dppa2 and Smarca5 knock-out ESCs lose expression of ZGA genes and functional experiments revealed that Smarca5âs regulation of ZGA-like transcription is dependent on Dppa2. Together， our single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CRISPRa-perturbed cells provides comprehensive system-level insights into the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate ZGA.,SAM mESCs were transduced with a lentiviral library of 475 short-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting maternal epigenetic factors， in triplicates at a <0.1 multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) ， and following selection and expansion of the pool of transduced cells， single-cell transcriptomes were generated using 10X 3â scRNA-seq and their corresponding sgRNAs further amplified with a specific amplification protocol (Hill et al. 2018). Each transduction replicate was loaded across a full 10X chip Chromium Controller (8 lanes)， with 20，000 cells per lane. Samples names are labelled with the replicate number 1-3 and 10X lane 1-8 (e.g: Replicate1_1 refers to transduction replicate 1 run in 10X lane 1). Amplicon sgRNA libraries were performed for each full length 10X cDNA sample (8 per replicate) and are referred to with the replicate number 1-3 and 10X lane 1-8 (e.g. amplicon_sgRNA_1_1 refers to the amplicon sgRNA libraries made on the 10X full length cDNA of sample1_1).,33899013,STAR Protoc

A SNF2 protein targets variable copy number repeats and thereby influences allele-specific expression,GSE22162,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,ATRX is an X-linked gene of the SWI/SNF family whose role in vivo is currently unknown. Mutations in ATRX cause syndromal mental retardation. ATRX binds to tandem repeat (TR) sequences both in heterochromatin (e.g. telomeres) and euchromatin. Genes associated with these TRs can be dysregulated when ATRX is mutated and the degree to which their expression changes is determined by the size of the TR， producing skewed allelic expression. This explains the nature of the affected genes， the variable phenotypes seen with identical ATRX mutations and also illustrates a new mechanism underlying variable penetrance. Many of the TRs in ATRX targets are G-rich and predicted to form non-B DNA structures (including G quadruplex) in vivo. We have shown that ATRX binds G quadruplex structures in vitro suggesting a mechanism by which ATRX may play a role in various nuclear processes and how this is perturbed when ATRX is mutated.,4 Human Erythroblast， 1 HEP3B and 1 Fibroblast ChIP-ChIP SampleFor ChIP-Seq: one human erythroblasts， one mouse ES， one human erythroblast reference Sample， and one mouse ES input reference Sample.,21029860,Cell

Biological effects with growht-inhibition were arised from the samples implanted by the ion fluences of 6Ã1017N+/cm2ï¼8Ã1017N+/cm2  because of the inhibition of seedling height and root length. We sequenced mRNA from these damaged rice seedlings and others. We identified 776 transcripts as reliable DEGs at the growth inhibition sample campared with the control.The pathway enrichment analysis of these 776 DEGs showed that pathway of photosynthesis - antenna proteins was down-regulated. Meanwhile transcription factor analysis showed that genes related to  AUX/IAA were also down-regulated.

SMC progressively aligns chromosomal arms in Caulobacter crescentus but is antagonized by convergent transcription,GSE97330,Caulobacter vibrioides,The Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complex plays an important role in chromosome organization and segregation in most living organisms. In Caulobacter crescentus， SMC is required to align the left and the right arms of the chromosome that run in parallel down the long axis of the cell. However， the mechanism of SMC-mediated alignment of chromosomal arms remains elusive. Here， using genome-wide methods and microscopy of single cells， we show that Caulobacter SMC is recruited to the centromeric parS site and that SMC-mediated arm alignment depends on the chromosome partitioning protein ParB. We provide evidence that SMC likely tethers the parS-proximal regions of the chromosomal arms together， promoting arm alignment. Furthermore， we show that highly-transcribed genes near parS that are oriented against SMC translocation disrupt arm alignment， suggesting that head-on transcription interferes with SMC translocation. Our results demonstrate a tight interdependence of bacterial chromosome organization and global patterns of transcription.,Caulobacter crescentus were grown as described previously in Skerker et al.， 2005 (PMID: 16176121).

Expression of RUNX1-ETO Rapidly Alters the Chromatin Landscape and Growth of Early Human Myeloid Precursor Cells (ChIP-Seq),GSE137670,Homo sapiens,Acute myeloid leukemia is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by recurrent mutations in genes encoding transcriptional， epigenetic and/or signaling regulators. The t(8;21) translocation generates the aberrant transcription factor RUNX1-ETO， whose expression can be detected in utero but is insufficient to cause overt disease. Although patients harboring cells with the t(8;21) translocation have acquired additional mutations and show extensive epigenetic reprogramming， the effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this question， we used a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive human myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding， blocks differentiation and arrests cellular growth， whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal. Single cell gene expression analyses show that RUNX1-ETO induction alters the differentiation of a defined sub-population of progenitors， indicating that oncoprotein-mediated transcriptional reprogramming is highly target cell-specific.,ChIP-Seq of human embryonic stem cells that have undergone hematopoietic differentiation.

VL30 retro-transposons are TRIM24-repressed enhancers that generate non-coding RNA to regulate gene expression in mouse hepatocytes. [RNA-Seq],GSE39851,Mus musculus,TRIM24 and TRIM33 interact to form a corepressor complex that suppresses murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TRIM24 and TRIM33 cooperatively repress retinoic acid receptor dependent activity of VL30 retro-transposons in hepatocytes in vivo. In TRIM24 knockout hepatocytes， VL30 long terminal repeats (LTRs) generate enhancer (e)RNAs and act as surrogate promoter and enhancer elements deregulating expression of neighbouring genes. We show that a VL30 LTR-derived eRNA is essential to activate the lipocalin 13 gene in hepatocytes in vivo. A further consequence of VL30 de-repression is the accumulation of retro-transcribed VL30 DNA in the cytoplasm of TRIM24-mutant hepatocytes and activation of the viral defence/interferon response. VL30 activation therefore modulates gene expression via the enhancer activity of the LTRs and by activation of the interferon response. Both of these processes are genetically linked to HCC development suggesting that VL30 repression by TRIM24 plays an important role in tumour suppression.,RNA profiles in liver of wild type (WT) and Trim24-/- mice by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.,23377542,Nat Struct Mol Biol
Inducible DamID systems for genomic mapping of chromatin proteins in Drosophila [RNA-seq],GSE75833,Drosophila melanogaster,Dam identification (DamID) is a powerful technique to generate genome-wide maps of chromatin protein binding. Due to its high sensitivity it is particularly suited to study the genome interactions of chromatin proteins in small tissue samples in model organisms such as Drosophila. Here we report an intein-based approach to tune the expression level of Dam and Dam-fusion proteins in Drosophila by addition of a ligand to fly food. This helps to suppress toxic effects of Dam. In addition we describe a strategy for genetically controlled expression of Dam in a specific cell type in complex tissues. We demonstrate the utility of the latter by generating a glia-specific map of Polycomb in small samples of brain tissue.,RNA sequencing of 3 samples， each using 2 biological replicates.,27001518,Nucleic Acids Res

Multimodal Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Two Distinct Radioresistant Stem-like and Progenitor Cell Populations in Murine Glioma,GSE142168,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Radiation therapy is part of the standard of care for gliomas and kills a subset of tumor cells， while also altering the tumor microenvironment. Previous work shows that tumor cells with stem-like properties preferentially survive radiation and give rise to glioma recurrence. Various techniques for enriching and quantifying cells with stem-like properties have been used， including the fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based side population (SP) assay， which is a functional assay that enriches for stem-like tumor cells. In these analyses， mouse models of glioma have been used to understand the biology of this disease and the therapeutic response， including the biology of the radiation response. We present here an analysis of combined SP and single-cell RNA sequencing of genetically-engineered mouse models of glioma to show a time course of cellular response to radiation. We identify and characterize two distinct tumor cell populations that are inherently radioresistant. In addition， we identify and characterize distinct effects of radiation on immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment.,We applied sciRNA-seq to 15 archived， frozen samples， which consisted of normal brain and tumor-containing hemisphere for each of 3 treatment conditions: no IR and 8 Â± 2 hours and approximately 72 hours after 10Gy,32621641,Glia
Targeted deletion of an Nr4a1Â­ associated enhancer ablates Ly6Clow monocytes while protecting pleiotropic gene function in macrophages [RNA-seq],GSE80036,Mus musculus,Mononuclear phagocytes are a diverse cell family that occupy all tissues and assume numerous functions to support tissue and systemic homeostasis. Our ability to investigate the roles of individual subsets is limited by an absence of approaches to ablate gene function within specific sub-populations. Using Nr4a1-dependent Ly6Clow monocytes as a representative cell type we show that enhancer deletion addresses these limitations. Combining ChIP-Seq and molecular approaches we identify a single， conserved， sub-domain within the Nr4a1 enhancer that is essential for Ly6Clow monocyte development. Mice lacking this enhancer lack Ly6Clow monocytes but retain Nr4a1 gene expression in macrophages during steady state and in response to LPS. Nr4a1 is a key negative regulator of inflammatory gene expression and decoupling these processes allows Ly6Clow monocytes to be studied without confounding influences. Enhancer targeting possesses greater specificity than cre recombinase-mediated gene deletion， providing a route to generate loss-of-function models in closely related cell types.,Paired End mRNA sequencing of FACS purified primary murine MDP， cMoP， Ly6Chi and Ly6Clow monocytes from the bone marrow and Ly6Chi and Ly6Clow monocytes from the peripheral blood,27814941,Immunity

Enhancers are Activated by p300/CBP Activity-Dependent PIC Assembly， RNAPII Recruitment and Pause Release [ATAC-Seq],GSE146325,Mus musculus,The metazoan-specific acetyltransferase p300/CBP is involved in activating signalinduced， enhancer-mediated transcription of cell-type-specific genes. However， the global kinetics and mechanisms of p300/CBP activity-dependent transcription activation remain poorly understood. We performed genome-wide， time-resolved analyses to show that enhancers and super-enhancers are dynamically activated through p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation， deactivated by the opposing deacetylase activity， and kinetic acetylation directly contributes to maintaining cell identity at very rapid timescales. The acetyltransferase activity is dispensable for the recruitment of p300/CBP and transcription factors， but essential for promoting the recruitment of TFIID and RNAPII at virtually all enhancers and enhancer-regulated genes. This identifies pre-initiation complex assembly as a dynamically controlled step in the transcription cycle and reveals p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation as the signal that specifically promotes transcription initiation at enhancer-regulated genes. We propose that p300/CBP activity uses a ârecruit-and-releaseâ mechanism to simultaneously promote RNAPII recruitment and pause release， and thereby， enables kinetic activation of enhancer-mediated transcription.,Chromatin accessibility changes before and after A-485 treatment in mouse ES cell using ATAC-Seq.,33765415,Mol Cell

UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project,GSE16256,Homo sapiens,The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition， these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes， a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs， and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells， we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm， trophoblast， mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages)， and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome， and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically， we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages， and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis， and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting， storage， and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally， we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.****************For data usage terms and conditions， please refer to:http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nih-common-fund/epigenomics-data-access-policies****************,UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project - samples and experiments will continue to be added to this study over the course of the project.EDACC Genboree Page:http://genboree.org/java-bin/project.jsp?projectName=XML%20Submissions%2FUCSD%2FSTUDY%2FEDACC.889,19829295,Nature

UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project,GSE16256,Homo sapiens,The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition， these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes， a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs， and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells， we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm， trophoblast， mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages)， and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome， and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically， we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages， and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis.

In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs， and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells， we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm， trophoblast， mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages)， and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome， and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically， we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages， and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis， and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting， storage， and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally， we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.****************For data usage terms and conditions， please refer to:http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nih-common-fund/epigenomics-data-access-policies****************,UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project - samples and experiments will continue to be added to this study over the course of the project.EDACC Genboree Page:http://genboree.org/java-bin/project.jsp?projectName=XML%20Submissions%2FUCSD%2FSTUDY%2FEDACC.889,21289626,Sci Transl Med

UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project,GSE16256,Homo sapiens,The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition， these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes， a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs， and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells， we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego.

RUNX1-ETO and RUNX1-EVI-1 differentially program the chromatin landscape in t(3;21) and t(8;21) AML but share global C/EBP-alpha dysfunction (RNA-Seq),GSE87285,Homo sapiens,RUNX1 is a frequent target of translocations in acute myeloid leukemia whereby its DNA binding domain fuses to different epigenetic regulators. To assess how different RUNX1 fusion proteins interact with the epigenome we compared the global binding patterns and the chromatin landscape of t(8;21) and t(3;21) AML which express RUNX1-ETO and RUNX1-EVI-1， respectively. We found that differential prognosis for these types of AML is reflected in fundamental differences in gene expression， chromatin landscape， binding patterns of the fusion proteins and other transcription factors as identified by genome-wide digital footprinting in patients. As previously shown for RUNX1-ETO， knockdown of RUNX1-EVI-1 expression initiates differentiation of t(3;21) cells which is associated with up-regulation of genes vital for myeloid differentiation， including C/EBPÎ±. Furthermore， by expressing either dominant-negative C/EBP or an inducible C/EBPÎ± construct in t(3;21) cells we show that C/EBPÎ± is necessary and sufficient for the differentiation response of these cells to RUNX1-EVI-1 knockdown.,RNA-seq expreiments have been used to study the chromatin landscape of t(8;21) and t(3;21) AML,28538183,Cell Rep

Batch effects and the effective design of single-cell gene expression studies,GSE77288,Homo sapiens,Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize variation in gene expression levels at high resolution. However， the sources of experimental noise in scRNA-seq are not yet well understood. We investigated the technical variation associated with sample processing using the single cell Fluidigm C1 platform. To do so， we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples， to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype， but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation， indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels. Based on our results， we suggest a framework for effective scRNA-seq studies.,We collected single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from three YRI iPSC lines using the Fluidigm C1 microfluidic system followed by sequencing. We added ERCC spike-in controls to each sample， and used 5-bp random sequence UMIs to allow for the direct quantification of mRNA molecule numbers. For each of the YRI lines， we performed three independent C1 collections; each replicate was accompanied by processing of a matching bulk sample using the same reagents. This study design allows us to estimate error and variability associated with the technical processing of the samples， independently from the biological variation across single cells of different individuals. We were also able to estimate how well scRNA-seq data can recapitulate the RNA-seq results from population bulk samples.We combined the 96 single cell samples from each C1 chip into their own master mix and sequenced across three lanes of a HiSeq 2500 (3 individuals x 3 replicates x 96 wells x 3 lanes = 2592 files). We prepared two separate library preparations for each bulk sample， combined them all into one master mix， and sequenced across four lanes (3 individuals x 3 replicates x 2 library preparations x 4 lanes = 72 files).,28045081,Sci Rep

Metabolic Reprogramming During Purine Stress in the Protozoan Pathogen Leishmania donovani,GSE48394,Leishmania donovani,The ability of Leishmania to survive in their insect or mammalian host is dependent upon an ability to sense and adapt to changes in the microenvironment. However， little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the parasite response to environmental changes， such as nutrient availability. To elucidate nutrient stress response pathways in Leishmania donovani， we have used purine starvation as the paradigm. The salvage of purines from the host milieu is obligatory for parasite replication; nevertheless， purine-starved parasites can persist in culture without supplementary purine for over 3 months， indicating that the response to purine starvation is robust and engenders parasite survival under conditions of extreme scarcity. To understand metabolic reprogramming during purine starvation we have employed global approaches. Whole proteome comparisons between purine-starved and purine-replete parasites over a 6-48 h span have revealed a temporal and coordinated response to purine starvation. Purine transporters and enzymes involved in acquisition at the cell surface are upregulated within a few hours of purine removal from the media， while other key purine salvage components are upregulated later in the time-course and more modestly.Â  After 48 h， the proteome of purine-starved parasites is extensively remodeled and adaptations to purine stress appear tailored to deal with both purine deprivation and general stress. To probe the molecular mechanisms affecting proteome remodeling in response to purine starvation， comparative RNA-seq analyses， qRT-PCR， and luciferase reporter assays were performed on purine-starved versus purine-replete parasites.Â  While the regulation of a minority of proteins tracked with changes at the mRNA level， for many regulated proteins it appears that proteome remodeling during purine stress occurs primarily via translational and post-translational mechanisms.,One mRNA sample from each of Purine-Starved and Purine-Replete cells were analyzed using SL RNA-Seq methodology,24586154,PLoS Pathog
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals activation of unique gene groups as a consequence of stem cell-parenchymal cell fusion,GSE69926,Mus musculus,Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the recipient can occur in the brain， liver， intestine and heart following transplantation.  The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown.  Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq， we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state.  But in the case of most other gene groups， hybrids were individually distinct.  In fact， though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners， approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day.  Some hybrids underwent reprogramming， expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups.  Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells， expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues， those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion.,Examination was performed using single-cell RNA-seq of five fusion products (BiFC_D1_F1-5， 24 hours) identified using BiFC， twenty-three fusion products (DC_D1_F1-16， 24 hours; DC_D3_F1-7， 72 hours) identified using dual expression of GFP and mCherry， the parental controls， and the population controls (mMSC_PC and HL1cm_PC).  Parental controls included 15 cells of each parental type isolated prior to co-culture (mMSC_1-15 and HL1cm_1-15) and 5 cells of each parental cell type isolated 24 hours after co-culture (mMSC_D1_1-5 and HL1cm_D1_1-5).  In addition， a population containing a mixture of both parental cells and fusion products obtained 24 hours after co-culture was included (Mix_D1).,26997336,Sci Rep

Efficient Yeast ChIP-Seq using Multiplex Short-Read DNA Sequencing,GSE13322,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Short-read DNA sequencing technologies provide new tools to answer biological questions.  However， high cost and low throughput limit their widespread use， particularly in organisms with smaller genomes such as S. cerevisiae.  Although ChIP-Seq in mammalian cell lines is replacing array-based ChIP-chip as the standard for transcription factor binding studies， ChIP-Seq in yeast is still underutilized compared to ChIP-chip.  We developed a multiplex barcoding system that allows simultaneous sequencing and analysis of multiple samples using Illuminaâs platform.  We applied this method to analyze the chromosomal distributions of three yeast DNA binding proteins (Ste12， Cse4 and RNA PolII) and a reference sample (input DNA) in a single experiment and demonstrate its utility for rapid and accurate results at reduced costs.  We developed a barcoding ChIP-Seq method for the concurrent analysis of transcription factor binding sites for yeast. Our multiplex strategy generated high quality data that was indistinguishable from data obtained with non-barcoded libraries.  None of the barcoded adapters induced differences relative to a non-barcoded adapter when applied to the same DNA sample. We used this method to map the binding sites for Cse4， Ste12 and Pol II throughout the yeast genome and we found 148 binding targets for Cse4， 823 targets for Ste12 and 2508 targets for PolII.  Cse4 was strongly bound to all yeast centromeres as expected and the remaining non-centromeric targets correspond to highly expressed genes in rich media， the latter constituting a novel finding.  We designed a multiplex short-read DNA sequencing method to perform efficient ChIP-Seq in yeast and other small genome model organisms.  This method produces accurate results with higher throughput and reduced cost.  Given constant improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies， increasing multiplexing will be possible to further decrease costs per sample and to accelerate the completion of large consortium projects such as modENCODE.,Examination of the distribution of PolII (4 biological replicates)， Cse4 (3 biological replicates) and Ste12 (3 biological replicates) using barcoded adapters and non-barcoded genomic DNA Illumina adapters.

Dissecting immune circuits by linking CRISPR pooled screens with single cell RNA-seq [SET2],GSE90487,Mus musculus,In multicellular organisms， dedicated regulatory circuits control cell-type diversity and response. The crosstalk and redundancies within these circuits and substantial cellular heterogeneity pose a major research challenge. We present CRISP-seq， an integrated method for massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq and CRISPR pooled screens. We show that profiling the perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell， enables to elucidate， the function of multiple factors and their interactions. In this benchmarking study， we applied this technology to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice， we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors controlling the commitment toward different cell lineages or the inflammatory and antiviral pathways. CRISP-seq thereby emerges as a broadly applicable， comprehensive， and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits.,DNA sequencing of guide RNA targeted loci for several CRISPR pools.  Libraries were generated using primer flanking the target region for bulk population of cells， and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq.,27984734,Cell
RNA-Seq: assessment of transcript level analysis tools [array],GSE75138,Mus musculus,This study uses spiked-in transcript in order to compare various bioinformatics approaches and tools to assemble， quantify abundance and detect differentially expressed transcripts using RNA-Seq data. Mouse total RNA seq was extracted from embryonic stem cells (ES) before (designated as day 0) and four days after the addition of retinoic acid. 48 spikes were made in vitro from plasmid constructs and added to the total RNA in different concentrations (each mix has a set of different spike concentrations， see paper's method). We found that detection of differential expression at the gene level is acceptable， yet on the transcript-isofom level all tools tested were lacking accuracy and precision.This set of microarrays was performed for the purpose of selecting unexpressed loci， to which spikes can be added,Microarray of mouse embryonic bodies in response to Retinoic acid.

IVT-seq reveals extreme bias in RNA-sequencing,GSE50445,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus;mixed libraries,Background:RNA-seq is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events， both known and novel. However， given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods， understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.Results:We present a method， in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq)， for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of over 1，000 in vitro transcribed RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with polyA and total RNA-seq， the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length， and we show in vitro transcription is incredibly processive， each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However， with common RNA-seq applications and platforms， we find 50% of transcripts have more than two-fold and 10% have more than 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. We also find greater than 6% of transcripts have regions of dramatically unpredictable sequencing coverage between samples， confounding accurate determination of their expression. We use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage， and several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.Conclusions:These results show the utility of IVT-seq for promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq. We find rRNA depletion is responsible for substantial， unappreciated biases in coverage introduced during library preparation. These biases suggest exon-level expression analysis may be inadvisable， and we recommend caution when interpreting RNA-seq results.,5 rRNA-depleted samples with duplicates， 1 polyA selected， 1 total RNA， and 1 plasmid library all without replicates.,24981968,Genome Biol

In depth analysis of the interaction of HIV-1 with cellular microRNA biogenesis and effector mechanisms,GSE59944,Homo sapiens,The question of how HIV-1 interfaces with cellular microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and effector mechanisms has been highly controversial. Here， we first used deep sequencing of small RNAs present in two different infected cell lines (TZM-bl and C8166) and two types of primary human cells (CD4+ PBMCs and macrophages) to unequivocally demonstrate that HIV-1 does not encode any viral miRNAs. Perhaps surprisingly， we also observed that infection of T cells by HIV-1 has only a modest effect on the expression of cellular miRNAs at early times after infection. Comprehensive analysis of miRNA binding to the HIV-1 genome using the photoactivatable ribonucleoside-induced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) technique revealed several binding sites for cellular miRNAs， a subset of which were shown to be capable of mediating miRNA-mediated repression of gene expression. However， the main finding from this analysis is that HIV-1 transcripts are largely refractory to miRNA binding， most probably due to extensive viral RNA secondary structure. Together， these data demonstrate that HIV-1 neither encodes viral miRNAs nor strongly influences cellular miRNA expression， at least early after infection， and imply that HIV-1 transcripts have evolved to avoid inhibition by pre-existing cellular miRNAs by adopting extensive RNA secondary structures that occlude most potential miRNA binding sites.,Small RNA profiling of HIV-1 infected cells through total small RNA deep sequencing and identification of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-associated HIV-1 sequences through the RNP-immunoprecipitation technique of PAR-CLIP on RISC,23592263,mBio

A Trichostatin A expression signature identified by TempO-Seq targeted whole transcriptome profiling,GSE91395,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct;unidentified,The use of gene expression signatures to classify compounds， identify efficacy or toxicity， and differentiate close analogs relies on the sensitivity of the method to identify modulated genes. We used a novel ligation-based targeted whole transcriptome expression profiling assay， TempO-SeqÂ®， to determine whether previously unreported compound-responsive genes could be identified and incorporated into a broad but specific compound signature. TempO-Seq exhibits 99.6% specificity， single cell sensitivity， and excellent correlation with fold differences measured by RNA-Seq (R2 = 0.9) for 20，629 targets. Unlike many expression assays， TempO-Seq does not require RNA purification， cDNA synthesis， or capture of targeted RNA， and lacks a 3â² end bias. To investigate the sensitivity of the TempO-Seq assay to identify significantly modulated compound-responsive genes， we derived whole transcriptome profiles from MCF-7 cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) and identified more than 9，000 differentially expressed genes. The TSA profile for MCF-7 cells overlapped those for HL-60 and PC-3 cells in the Connectivity Map (cMAP) database， suggesting a common TSA-specific expression profile independent of baseline gene expression. A 43-gene cell-independent TSA signature was extracted from cMAP and confirmed in TempO-Seq MCF-7 data. Additional genes that were not previously reported to be TSA responsive in the cMAP database were also identified. TSA treatment of 5 cell types revealed 1，136 differentially expressed genes in common， including 785 genes not previously reported to be TSA responsive. We conclude that TSA induces a specific expression signature that is consistent across widely different cell types， that this signature contains genes not previously associated with TSA responses， and that TempO-Seq provides the sensitive differential expression detection needed to define such compound-specific， cell-independent， changes in expression.,Commercially available human reference and tissue RNAs， unpurified cell lysates from MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 cells， and synthetic ERCC RNAs were used to assess performance of a targeted whole transcriptome expression profiling method. In addition， MCF-7 cells， PC3 cells and HL60 cells were exposed to Trichostatin A， then lysed and profiled， to define a novel TSA-specific expression signature.Samples GSM2429258 - GSM2429287 were purified reference RNAs and brain RNAs and mixtures between them that were run in the TempO-Seq assay in replicates of 6 each. Samples GSM2429258 - GSM2429287 have no associated raw data due to data loss.The GSM2460368-GSM2460377 samples represent human reference RNA replicates that were processed in parallel， pooled in a single library and sequenced twice on the same instrument.,28542535,PLoS One

Developmental changes in the in vitro activated regenerative activity of primitive mammary epithelial cells,GSE46357,Mus musculus,Many normal adult tissues contain rare stem cells with extensive self-maintaining regenerative potential. During development， the stem cells of the hematopoietic and neural systems undergo intrinsically specified changes in their self-renewal potential. In the mouse， mammary stem cells with transplantable regenerative activity are first detectable a few days before birth. They share some phenotypic properties with their adult counterparts but are enriched in a subpopulation that displays a distinct gene expression profile. Here we show that fetal mammary epithelial cells have a greater direct and inducible growth potential than their adult counterparts. The latter feature is revealed in a novel culture system that enables large numbers of mammary stem cells with serially transplantable activity as well as in vitro clonogenic progenitors to be produced within 7 days from single fetal or adult input cells. We further show that these responses are highly dependent on novel factors produced by fibroblasts. These findings provide new avenues for elucidating mechanisms that regulate normal mammary epithelial stem cell properties at the single-cell level， how these change during development， and how their perturbation may contribute to transformation.We used microarrays to compare the transcriptome of E18.5 fetal and adult MRU-enriched mammary cells.,Three biological replicates each of CD31-CD45-Ter119-BP-1-EpCAM+CD49f+ adult basal cells and CD31-CD45-Ter119-EpCAM++CD49f+ fetal cells were sorted.

Genetic influences on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana,GSE92568,Arabidopsis thaliana,In this study， we describe the impact of genetic variation on transcript abundance in an F2 population of Arabidopsis thaliana. The RNA-seq resource generated by this study is suitable for expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. From the aligned RNA-seq reads， and available genomic data for each of the parents of the cross， we imputed the genomes of each F2 individual (to allow genetic mapping of RNA abundance traits; briefly， genetic differences in aligned RNA-seq reads were used to impute each F2 genome). Our results show that heritable differences on gene expression can be detected using F2 populations (that is， single F2 plants)， and shed light on the control of expression differences among strains of this reference plant.,183 samples consisting of single F2 plants of a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions 8230 and 6195 were generated. For each sample， RNA was collected from the aerial shoot at the 9th true leaf stage， and Illumina mRNA-seq libraries were constructed. Using these libraries， 50 bp single end RNA-seq Illumina reads were generated for each sample， and used to quantify gene expresison in each individual. The resulting expression phenotypes are suitable for genetic mapping of the control of gene expression differences in the species.,28464948,Genome Biol

A saturating mutagenesis CRISPR-Cas9 mediated functional genomic screen identifies cis- and trans- regulatory elements of Oct4 in embryonic stem cells (sgRNA-seq),GSE140910,Mus musculus,Regulatory elements (REs) consist of enhancers and promoters that occupy a significant portion of the non-coding genome and control gene expression programs either in âcis or in âtrans. Putative REs have been identified largely based on their regulatory features (co-occupancy of ESC-specific transcription factors， enhancer histone marks and DNase hypersensitivity) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However， less has been established regarding their regulatory functions in their native context. We deployed cis- and trans-regulatory elements scanning through saturating mutagenesis and sequencing (ctSCAN-SMS) to target elements within the ~12kb cis-region of the Oct4 gene locus， as well as genome-wide 2，613 high-confidence trans-REs (TREs)， in mESCs. The ctSCAN-SMS identified 10 CREs and 12 TREs， as novel candidate REs of the Oct4 gene in mESCs. Furthermore， deletion of these REs confirmed that the majority of the CREs and TREs are functionally active， and involved in regulating Oct4 gene expression. Additionally， a subset of the functional CREs and TREs physically interact with the Oct4 promoter to varying degrees through intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions， respectively. Comparative genomics analysis reveals that functional CREs are more conserved in terms of their regulatory sequence conservation between mouse and primates (including humans) than TREs. Notably， a few active CREs are devoid of canonical regulatory features. Taken together， our work demonstrates the reliability and robustness of ctSCAN-SMS screening to identify critical REs， and probe their roles in the regulation of transcriptional output of a target gene (in this case Oct4).,Deep sequencing of sgRNAs from GFP-negative/low and pre-sort cell populations of REs CRISPR-Cas9 pool screen,32994224,J Biol Chem

Break-Seq of DNA double stranded breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae WT and mec1 cells after exposure to hydroxyurea,GSE58808,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,We previously demonstrated that inactivation of the replication checkpoint via a mec1 mutation led to chromosome breakage at replication forks initiated from virtually all origins of replication， after transient exposure to hydroxyurea (HU)， an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase.  Furthermore， we have shown that chromosomes break at replication forks that have suffered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation.  Here we sought to determine whether all replication forks containing ssDNA gaps have equal probability of producing double strand breaks (DSBs) when cells attempt to recover from HU exposure.  We devised a new methodology， Break-Seq， that combines our previously described DSB labeling with NextGen sequencing to map chromosome breaks with improved sensitivity and resolution.  We show that DSBs preferentially occur at genes transcriptionally induced by HU.  Notably， different subsets of the HU-induced genes produced DSBs in MEC1 and mec1 cells as replication forks traversed greater distance in MEC1 cells than in mec1 cells during the recovery from HU.  Specifically， while MEC1 cells exhibited chromosome breakage at stress-response transcription factors， mec1 cells predominantly suffered chromosome breakage at transporter genes， many of which are the substrates of the said transcription factors.  We propose that HU-induced chromosome fragility arises at higher frequency near HU-induced genes as a result of destabilized replication forks encountering transcription factor binding and/or the act of transcription.  Our model provides an explanation for a long-standing problem in chromosome biology: why different replication inhibitors produce different spectra of chromosome breakage?  We propose that different inhibitors elicit different transcription responses as well as destabilize replication forks， and， when the two processes collide， ssDNA at the replication fork suffers further strand breakage， causing DSBs.,We queried the yeast genome for DSBs after cells were treated with 200 mM hydroxyurea during S phase.  Samples were collected from 1) cells synchronized in G1 phase by alpha factor; 2) cells released from G1 into medium containing 200 mM hydroxyurea for 1 h; 3) cells recovering in fresh medium without hydroxyurea for 1 h after the 1 h exposure to HU.  These samples are referred to as G1， HU 1h， and R 1h， respectively.   The strains from which the samples were collected are indicated following the time point， e.g. G1_MEC1 or R 1h_mec1.  The experiment with mec1 was done twice (Experiments A and B) and that with MEC1 was done once (Experiment C).

Sustained experimental activation of FGF8/ERK in the developing chicken spinal cord reproducibly models early events in ERK-mediated tumorigenesis,GSE182072,Gallus gallus,Most human cancers demonstrate activated MAPK/ERK pathway signaling as a key tumor initiation step， but the immediate steps of further oncogenic progression are poorly understood due to a lack of appropriate models. Spinal cord differentiation follows caudal elongation in vertebrate embryos; both processes are regulated by a FGF8 gradient highest in neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP)， where kinase effectors ERK1/2 maintain an undifferentiated state. FGF8/ERK signal attenuation is necessary for NMPs to progress to differentiation. We show that sustained ERK1/2 activity， using a constitutively active form of the kinase MEK1 (MEK1ca) in the chicken embryo， reproducibly provokes neopasia in the developing spinal cord. Transcriptomic data show that neoplasia not only relies on the maintenance of NMP gene expression， and the inhibition of genes expressed in the differentiating spinal cord， but also on a profound change in the transcriptional signature of the spinal cord cells leading to a complete loss of cell-type identity. MEK1ca expression in the developing spinal cord of the chicken embryo is therefore a tractable in vivo model to identify the critical factors fostering malignancy in ERK-induced tumorigenesis.,Neural tube in ovo electroporations were performed at HH11.

Transcriptomic profilling of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) downy mildew (Peronospora belbahrii) infection,GSE79807,Ocimum basilicum;Peronospora belbahrii,Applying a metatranscriptomic analysis pipeline (Guo et al. 2016 Frontiers in Plant Science)， we are the first to analyze the host-pathogen metatranscriptome of the basil downy mildew system. RNA-sequencing technology was utilized to gain access to the full array of expressed transcripts from both O. basilicum and P. belbahrii. This RNA-seq workflow has allowed us to identity nearly 3，000 candidate P. belbahrii genes expressed in planta， as well as 1，267 and 2，798 candidate O. basilicum genes induced or suppressed respectively under P. belbahrii infection (five days post inoculation). Up-regulated candidate genes are highly enriched for biological processes such as biotic and abiotic stress responses whereas down-regulated genes are enriched for metabolism and photosynthesis， suggesting that basil plants actively respond to pathogen infection with transcriptome reprogramming.,RNAseq data were generated from O. basilicum plants either uninfected or infected with P. belbahrii at 5 days post inoculation.,27462318,Front Plant Sci
A functional map of genomic HIF1Î±-DNA complexes in the eye lens revealed through multiomics analysis [RNA-seq],GSE166632,Gallus gallus,Background:During eye lens development the fetal vasculature regresses leaving the lens without a direct oxygen source. Both embryonically and throughout adult life， the lens contains a decreasing oxygen gradient from the surface to the core that parallels the natural differentiation of immature surface epithelial cells into mature core transparent fiber cells. These properties of the lens suggest a potential role for hypoxia in the regulation of genes required for mature lens structure and function. Since HIF1Î± is a master regulator of the hypoxic response， these lens properties also implicate HIF1Î± as a potential requirement for lens formation and homeostasis.  Here， we employed a multiomics approach combining CUT&RUN， RNAseq and ATACseq analysis to establish the genomic complement of lens HIF1Î± binding sites， genes activated or repressed by HIF1Î± and the chromatin states of HIF1Î±-regulated genes.Results:CUT&RUN analysis revealed 8，375 HIF1Î±-DNA binding complexes in the chick lens genome. 1，190 HIF1Î±-DNA binding complexes were significantly clustered within chromatin accessible regions (Ï2 test p < 1x10-55) identified by ATACseq. Formation of the identified HIF1Î±-DNA complexes paralleled the activation or repression of 526 genes， 116 of which contained HIF1Î± binding sites within 10kB of the transcription start sites. Some of the identified HIF1Î± genes have previously established lens functions while others have novel functions never before examined in the lens. GO and pathway analysis of these genes implicate HIF1Î± in the control of a wide-variety of cellular pathways potentially critical for lens formation， structure and function including glycolysis， cell cycle regulation， chromatin remodeling， Notch and Wnt signaling， differentiation， development， and transparency.Conclusions:These data establish the first functional map of genomic HIF1Î±-DNA complexes in the eye lens. They identify HIF1Î± as an important regulator of a wide-variety of genes previously shown to be critical for lens formation and function and they reveal a requirement for HIF1Î± in the regulation of a wide-variety of genes not yet examined for lens function. They support a requirement for HIF1Î± in lens development， structure and function and they provide a basis for understanding the potential roles and requirements for HIF1Î± in the development， structure and function of more complex tissues.,RNA-seq of six samples,34215186,BMC Genomics
RBFOX2 alter splicing outcome in distinct binding modes with multiple protein partners,GSE140679,Homo sapiens,RBFOX2 controls the splicing of a large number of transcripts implicated in cell differentiation and development. Parsing RNA-binding protein datasets， we uncover that RBFOX2 can interact with hnRNPC， hnRNPM and SRSF1 to regulate splicing of a broad range of splicing events using different sequence motifs and binding modes. Using immunoprecipitation， specific RBP knockdown， RNA-seq and splice-sensitive PCR， we show that RBFOX2 can target splice sites using three binding configurations: single， multiple or secondary modes. In the single binding mode RBFOX2 is recruited to its target splice sites through a single canonical binding motif， while in the multiple binding mode RBFOX2 binding sites include the adjacent binding of at least one other RNA binding protein partner. Finally， in the secondary binding mode RBFOX2 likely does not bind the RNA directly but is recruited to splice sites lacking its canonical binding motif through the binding of one of its protein partners. These dynamic modes bind distinct sets of transcripts at different positions and distances relative to alternative splice sites explaining the heterogeneity of RBFOX2 targets and splicing outcomes.,Each of the four RBPs (RBFOX2， hnRNPC， hnRNPM and SRSF1) were depleted using 2 different siRNA in 2 biological replicates. Lipofectamine (lipo) samples serve as mock control.,34244793,Nucleic Acids Res
SIX6 regulation in human optic vesicles is mediated by early microenvironmenta factors,GSE148168,Homo sapiens,Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) represent an exciting tool to investigate the mechanisms of human eye development and to build models of human retinal disease. When grown in 3D， these cells can self-organize into laminar organized retinas; however， significant variation in the size， shape and composition of individual organoids exists， and this variation can create challenges. Neither the microenvironment nor the timing of critical growth factors driving eye formation or retinogenesis are fully understood. To explore the dynamics of early retinal organoid development， we have developed a SIX6-GFP reporter line that enables the systematic optimization of early eye field development， allowing for the identification of conditions that favor optic development. We found that SIX6 expression in 3D optic structures is influenced by small molecules regulating SHH and WNT signaling in a dose and time dependent fashion. In addition， we demonstrated that hypoxic growth conditions favor SIX6 expression， and promote eye formation. The systematic optimization of these pathways leads to optic vesicles with robust SIX6 expression and global gene expression profiles consistent with a retinal identity. The use of stem cell derived human retinal organoids with a real time marker for retinogenesis， therefore， represents an important model for probing the mechanisms of early human eye development.,Day 35 retina cups were pooled (n=10-12) and separated as either GFP+ (n=2) or GFP- (n=3) samples and compared to human stem cells (n=2) (total of 7 samples run for RNA-seq).,nan,

Impaired function of rDNA transcription initiation machinery leads to derepression of ribosomal genes with insertions of R2 retrotransposon,GSE183035,Drosophila melanogaster,Eukaryotic genomes harbor hundreds of rRNA genes， many of which are transcriptionally silent.However， little is known about selective regulation of individual rDNA units. In Drosophila melanogaster， some rDNA repeats contain insertions of the R2 retrotransposon， which is capable to be transcribed only as part of pre-rRNA molecules. rDNA units with R2 insertions are usually inactivated， although R2 expression may be beneficial in cells with decreased rDNA copy number. Here we found that R2-inserted rDNA units are enriched with HP1a and H3K9me3 repressive mark， whereas disruption of the heterochromatin components slightly affects their silencing in ovarian germ cells. Surprisingly， we observed a dramatic upregulation of R2-inserted rRNA genes in ovaries lacking Udd (Under-developed) or other subunits (TAF1b and Ð¢AF1c-like) of the SL1-like complex， which is homologues to mammalian Selective factor 1 (SL1) involved in rDNA transcription initiation. Derepression of rRNA genes with R2 insertions was accompanied by a reduction of H3K9me3 and HP1a enrichment. We suggest that the impairment of the SL1-like complex affects a mechanism of selective activation of intact rDNA units which competes with heterochromatin formation. We also propose that R2 derepression may serve as an adaptive response to compromised rRNA synthesis.,Udd ChIP libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000. rRNA-depleted RNA-seq in udd mutant ovaries.cDNA libraries were sequenced on MGISEQ-2000,nan,

Compromised nonsense-mediated RNA decay results in truncated RNA-binding protein production upon DUX4 expression,GSE178759,Homo sapiens,Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) degrades transcripts carrying premature termination codons. NMD is thought to prevent the synthesis of toxic truncated proteins. However， whether loss of NMD results in widespread production of truncated proteins is unclear. A human genetic disease， facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)， features acute inhibition of NMD upon expression of the disease-causing transcription factor， DUX4. Using a cell-based model of FSHD， we show production of truncated proteins from physiological NMD targets and find that RNA-binding proteins are enriched for aberrant truncations. The NMD isoform of one RNA-binding protein， SRSF3， is translated to produce a stable truncated protein， which is detected in FSHD patient-derived myotubes. Ectopic expression of truncated SRSF3 confers toxicity， and its downregulation is cytoprotective. Our results delineate the genome-scale impact of NMD loss.

However， the molecular features and cellular functions of the highly heterogeneous populations of nonCMs and how these populations cooperate to regenerate the injured heart remain largely unexplored. Using the newly developed LIGER algorithm that allows flexible modeling across highly diverse single-cell datasets， we analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of 61，977 individual nonCMs isolated at multiple time points during zebrafish heart regeneration. Combining single-cell analysis and in situ hybridization， we identified major nonCM cell types， including multiple novel subpopulations with unique tempo-spatial distributions and highly cooperative interactions in the regenerating heart. Interestingly， genetic perturbation of macrophage function by kit knockout led to accumulation of fibrotic deposits and severely compromised cardiomyocyte proliferation and myocardium regeneration. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of nonCMs during cardiac regeneration provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of cardiac regeneration.,To assess the proliferation defect of kit (aka， c-kit) mutant CMs， we conducted transcriptome-wide bulk RNA-seq of control and mutant cardiomyocytes,34523214,EMBO Rep

Recombinant erythroid Kruppel-like factor fused to GATA1 up-regulates delta- and gamma-globin expression in erythroid cells primary adult human erythroid progenitor cells,GSE189272,Homo sapiens,The EKLF-GATA1 fusion proteins enhances Î´-globin expression through interaction with the GATA1-binding motif of the Î´-globin promoter. The goal this study is to find if  the fusion proteins could have a different pattern of chromatin occupation from GATA1.  The alignment of ChIP-Seq peaks revealed that the binding peaks of EKLF-GATA1 fusion proteins at the Î²-globin cluster overlapped substantially with those of GATA1 (A)， suggesting that these proteins may associate with chromatin in a similar configuration within the Î²-globin locus and LCR. Global analysis of EKLF-GATA1 and GATA1 ChIP-seq data sets also revealed a significant number of shared sites on the genomic scale.,CD34+ cells transduced with EKLF， GATA1， or EKLF-GATA1 proteins， in quadruplicate.,nan,
Analysis of long and short enhancers in melanoma cell states,GSE180879,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct,Understanding how enhancers drive cell type specificity and efficiently identifying them is essential for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. In melanoma， the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) states present themselves with different responses to therapy， making the identification of specific enhancers highly relevant. Using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in a panel of patient-derived melanoma lines (MM lines)， we set to identify and decipher melanoma enhancers by first focusing on regions with state specific H3K27 acetylation close to differentially expressed genes. A more in-depth evaluation of those regions was then pursued by investigating the activity of ATAC-seq peaks found therein along with a full tiling of the acetylated regions with 190 bp sequences. Activity was observed in more than 60% of the selected regions and we were able to precisely locate the active regions within ATAC-seq peaks. Comparison of sequence content with activity， using the deep learning model DeepMEL2， revealed that AP-1 alone is responsible for the MES enhancer activity， while SOX and MITF both influence MEL enhancer activity with SOX being required to achieve high levels of activity. Overall， our MPRA assays shed light on the relationship between long and short sequences in terms of their sequence content， enhancer activity， and specificity as reporters across melanoma cell states.,Eight MPRA libraries are used in this study， including 7 CHEQ-seq libraries and 1 STARR-seq library. For each CHEQ-seq library an enhancer - barcode assignment is done by sequencing of the plasmid library with PacBio or Illumina sequencing.

AÂ Genome-wide Chronological Study of Gene Expression and Two HistoneÂ Modifications， H3K4me3 and H3K9ac， during Developmental Leaf Senescence [RNA-seq],GSE67777,Arabidopsis thaliana,The genome-wide abundance of two histone modifications， H3K4me3 and H3K9ac， both associated with actively expressed genes， was monitored in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves at different time points during developmental senescence， along with expression in the form of RNA-seq data. H3K9ac and H3K4me3 marks were highly convergent at all stages of leaf aging， but H3K4me3 marks covered nearly twice the gene area as H3K9ac marks. Genes with the greatest fold-change in expression displayed the largest positively-correlated percent change in coverage for both marks. Most senescence up-regulated genes were pre-marked by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac， but at levels below the whole-genome average， and for these genes， gene expression increased without a significant increase in either histone mark. However， for a subset of genes showing increased or decreased expression， the respective gain or loss of H3K4me3 marks were found to closely match the temporal changes in mRNA abundance. 22% of genes that increased expression during senescence showed accompanying changes in H3K4me3 modification， and they include numerous regulatory genes， which may act as primary response genes.,RNA-seq data at different stages of leaf aging.,25802367,Plant Physiol

Dynamic Control of X-Chromosome Conformation and Repression by a Histone H4K20 Demethylase,GSE84581,Caenorhabditis elegans,Chromatin modification and higher-order chromosome structure play key roles in gene regulation， but their functional interplay in controlling gene expression is elusive. We discovered the machinery and mechanism underlying the dynamic enrichment of histone modification H4K20me1 on hermaphrodite X chromosomes during C. elegans dosage compensation and demonstrated H4K20me1's pivotal role in regulating higher-order chromosome structure and X-chromosome-wide gene expression. Structure and activity of dosage-compensation-complex (DCC) subunit DPY-21 defined a novel Jumonji demethylase subfamily that converts H4K20me2 to H4K20me1 in worms and mammals. Selective inactivation of demethylase activity eliminated H4K20me1 enrichment in somatic cells， elevated X-linked gene expression， reduced X-chromosome compaction， and disrupted X-chromosome conformation by diminishing formation of topologically-associating domains (TADs). Unexpectedly， DPY-21 also associates with autosomes of germ cells in a DCC-independent manner to enrich H4K20me1 and trigger chromosome compaction. Our findings demonstrate the direct link between chromatin modification and higher-order chromosome structure in long-range regulation of gene expression.,The chromatin modification H4K20me1 becomes enriched on the dosage-compensated X chromosomes of C. elegans hermaphrodites.  We explored the machinery and mechanism underlying the enrichment of H4K20me1 on X chromosomes and discovered H4K20me1's pivotal role in regulating higher-order chromosome structure and X-chromosome gene expression.  Through X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays， we found that the DPY-21 subunit of the C. elegans dosage compensation complex defines a new subfamily of Jumonji C (JmjC) histone demethylases that converts H4K20me2 to H4K20me1 and is widely conserved from worms to mammals. ChIP-seq and immunofluorescence studies showed that inactivation of JmjC activity in vivo by genome editing abrogated H4K20me1 enrichment on X.  Hi-C studies showed loss of demethylase activity reduced X-chromosome compaction and disrupted X-chromosome topology by weakening TAD boundaries.  RNA-seq studies showed that loss of demethylase activity elevated X-linked gene expression， demonstrating a key role for H4K20me1 in DC. Unexpectedly in germ cells， DPY-21 associates with autosomes， but not X chromosomes， in a DCC-independent manner to enrich H4K20me1 and facilitate chromosome compaction. Thus， DPY-21 is an adaptable chromatin regulator that is harnessed during development for distinct biological functions. In both somatic cells and germ cells， H4K20me1 enrichment modulates 3D chromosome architecture， demonstrating the direct impact of chromatin modification on establishing higher-order chromosome structure.To examine the genome-wide distribution of H4K20me1 in C. elegans at high resolution and determine the effect of dpy-21 demethylase mutations on H4K20me1 enrichment， we performed ChIP-seq in mixed-stage embryos from wild-type， dpy-21(y607 JmjC)， and dpy-21(e428 null) mutant strains. We were able to compare directly the levels of H4K20me1 in wild-type and dpy-21 mutant embryos， because we used wide-type C. tropicalis embryos as a spike-in control to normalize the read enrichment.  Two biological replicates were examined for each genotype.To assay the effect of H4K20me1 on the regulation of X-chromosome gene expression， we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on three different dpy-21(JmjC) demethylase mutant strains that prevented the conversion of H4K20me2 to H4K20me1 on X chromosomes and compared the expression of genes on X and autosomes with that in wild-type strains and strains with reduced activity of set-1， the methyltransferase that converts H4K20me to H4K20me1 and set-4， the methyltransferase that converts H4K20me1 to H4K20me2/me3.  Mixed-stage embryos were assayed from 3 biological replicates of dpy-21(y607 JmjC)， 3 replicates of dpy-21(y618 JmjC)， 3 replicates of dpy-21(y622 JmjC)， 7 replicates of dpy-21(e428 null)， 7 replicates of the wild-type (N2) strain， 2 replicates of the wild-type (N2) strain grown on control RNAi bacteria (L4440)， 3 replicates of set-1(RNAi)， and 3 replicates of set-4(n4600).To assess the effect of H4K20me1 enrichment on X-chromosome topology， we performed genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments on mixed-stage wild-type (N2) and dpy-21(y607 JmjC) mutant embryos by combining a previously published Hi-C protocol with in-nucleus ligation (Crane et al.， 2015; Rao et al.，,28867287,Cell
HOST MICROBIOTA REGULATE SELECTIVE MYELOID SUBSETS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING HOMEOSTASIS AND DISEASE,GSE178956,Mus musculus,The immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) comprise parenchymal microglia and at the CNS border regions meningeal， perivascular and choroid plexus macrophages (summarized as CNS-associated macrophages， CAMs). Previous work has uncovered that microglial properties are strongly dependent on environmental signals from the commensal microbiota while its effect on CAMs remained unknown. By combining several microbiota manipulation approaches， genetic mouse models and single-cell RNA-sequencing， we comprehensively characterized CNS myeloid cell composition and function. Under steady-state， the transcriptional profile and numbers of choroid plexus macrophages were found to be tightly steered by complex microbiota. Divergently， perivascular and meningeal macrophages were affected to a lesser extent. An acute perturbation through viral infection evoked an attenuated immune response of all CAMs in germ-free mice. Additionally， we assessed CAMs in a more chronic pathological state in 5xFAD mice as a model for Alzheimerâs disease whereby exclusively perivascular macrophages displayed enhanced amyloid beta uptake in GF 5xFAD mice. Our results provide novel insights for understanding distinct microbiota-CNS macrophage interactions during health and perturbation that could potentially be targeted therapeutically.,CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) from the parenchyma， leptomeninges and choroid plexus were compared between mice housed in germ-free and controls housed in specific pathogen free conditions. Tissues from n â¥ 5 mice per group were pooled for higher cell yields of CAMs. The different CNS compartments were separated， and myeloid cells were isolated as previously described with minor modifications (Erny et al.， 2015， Jordao et al.， 2019).,nan,

Compromised nonsense-mediated RNA decay results in truncated RNA-binding protein production upon DUX4 expression,GSE178760,Homo sapiens,Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) degrades transcripts carrying premature termination codons. NMD is thought to prevent the synthesis of toxic truncated proteins. However， whether loss of NMD results in widespread production of truncated proteins is unclear. A human genetic disease， facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)， features acute inhibition of NMD upon expression of the disease-causing transcription factor， DUX4. Using a cell-based model of FSHD， we show production of truncated proteins from physiological NMD targets and find that RNA-binding proteins are enriched for aberrant truncations. The NMD isoform of one RNA-binding protein， SRSF3， is translated to produce a stable truncated protein， which is detected in FSHD patient-derived myotubes. Ectopic expression of truncated SRSF3 confers toxicity， and its downregulation is cytoprotective. Our results delineate the genome-scale impact of NMD loss. This widespread production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins has implications for FSHD biology as well as other genetic diseases where NMD is therapeutically modulated.,Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) of human myoblasts harboring an inducible DUX4 transgene was performed on ribosome-protected RNA samples collected from 3 separate biological replicates treated for 0， 4， 8， or 14 h with doxycycline to induce DUX4 expression.,37314931,Cell Rep

Transcriptome-wide N6-methyladenine profiling in low input multiplex samples by a kit-free multi-barcode method,GSE185749,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,N6-methyladnine， which is the most abundant post-transcriptional RNA modification in eukaryotic mRNA， has been proved to be essential in various biological processes and related to numerous diseases. Transcriptome-wide m6A profiling by next generation sequencing is widely used to explore the distributions as well as quantity of m6A modifications. As traditional m6A-seq demands large amount of starting RNA which limited its application to clinical samples， we present a strategy of low input multi-barcode m6A-seq (SLIM-m6A-seq) to realize simplified m6A profiling of mixed clinical samples.

Synthetic genomic reconstitution reveals principles of mammalian Hox cluster regulation [RNA-Seq],GSE190896,Mus musculus,Precise Hox gene expression is crucial for embryonic patterning. Local transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have emerged as the major regulatory modes controlling the initiation and maintenance of Hox gene expression. However， quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here， we introduce âsynthetic regulatory reconstitutionâ， a novel conceptual framework for studying gene regulation and apply it to the mammalian HoxA cluster. To measure the HoxA intrinsic regulatory potential and distal enhancer contributions， we de novo synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130-170 kilobases each) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We find that a minimal HoxA cluster lacking distal enhancers induces the appropriate gene set and establishes distinct chromatin domains in response to patterning signals， while distal enhancers are required for full transcriptional output. These results suggest that the genomically compact Hox clusters contain all the information to decode patterning signals and maintain positional information,RNA-Seq was used to study global gene expression in cells carrying synthetic Hox cluster variants during ESC-to-MN differentiation,nan,
Retrieving high-resolution chromatin interactions and decoding enhancer regulatory potential in silico,GSE161636,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The advent of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and related technologies has profoundly renewed our understaning of three-dimensional chromatin folding in mammalian nuclei. Alongside these experimental approaches， numerous computational tools for handling， normalizing， visualizing， and ultimately detecting interactions in 3C-type datasets are being developed. Here， we present Bloom， a comprehensive method for the analysis of 3C-type data matrices on the basis of Dirichlet process mixture models that addresses two important open issues. First， it retrieves occult interaction patterns from sparse data， like those derived from single-cell or ânativeâ Hi-C experiments; thus， bloomed sparse data can now be used to study interaction landscapes at high-resolution. Second， it detects enhancer-promoter interactions with high sensitivity and inherently assigns an interaction frequency score (IFS) to each contact. Using enhancer perturbation data of different throughput， we show that IFS accurately quantifies the regulatory influence of each enhancer on its target promoter. As a result， Bloom allows decoding of complex regulatory landscapes by generating functionally-relevant enhancer atlases solely on the basis of 3C-type data.,HiC experiments on 5x106 mESC and 106 CM cells.,nan,
Senescence induction dictates response and resistance to chemo- and immunotherapy in preclinical models of ovarian cancer,GSE181651,Mus musculus,High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is associated with a dismal prognosis. While most patients initially respond to platinum-based chemotherapy， they almost always acquire resistance， and only a small subset of HGSOC patients benefit from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). To elucidate the disease mechanisms and factors underlying sensitivity and resistance to conventional and immune-based therapies， we developed a fast and flexible pre-clinical mouse model based on somatic introduction of HGSOC-associated genetic alterations into the ovary of immune competent mice using tissue electroporation. Tumors in these mice recapitulate both the proclivity of HGSOC to metastasize to the peritoneum and omentum and display histological， molecular， and treatment response features reminiscent of the human disease. Using this model， we show that the clinically observed increase in sensitivity of homologous recombination (HR) deficient ovarian tumors to platinum-based chemotherapy is driven by the preferential induction of senescence in the tumor cells. Intriguingly， HR-deficient (but not HR-proficient) tumors are uniquely sensitive to the combination of cisplatin and ICB owing to senescence-mediated activation of the cytosolic DNA sensing. This output becomes deactivated in a therapy-resistant model. Thus， genetically defined electroporation-based mouse models can be leveraged to elucidate the biology and therapy responses of HGSOG with the goal of improving treatment options for this deadly disease.,For RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptional profiles of MP EPO-GEMM ovarian tumors， as well as normal ovaries of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6， total RNA was extracted from bulk tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).

Low-input， deterministic profiling of single-cell transcriptomes reveals individual intestinal organoid subtypes comprised of single， dominant cell types [C1-HEK],GSE183686,Homo sapiens,High-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to resolve cellular properties across systems. A key scRNA-seq catalyzer was the introduction of microdroplet-based systems， which vastly improved sample handling and cell throughput. While powerful， the current microfluidic systems are limited to high cell density (>1000 cells) samples. This prevents the efficient processing of individual， small tissues or rare cells， leading to respectively confounded mosaic cell population read-outs or failed capture of diagnostically interesting cells.  In this study， we developed a deterministic， mRNA-capture bead and cell co-encapsulation droplet system， DisCo， that overcomes these limitations by enabling precise particle position and droplet sorting control through combined machine-vision and multilayer microfluidics. We demonstrate that DisCo is capable of processing samples containing few cells (< 100 cells) at high efficiencies( >70%). To underscore the unique capabilities of DisCo， we mapped the developmental process of 31 individual intestinal organoids at the single cell level. This uncovered extensive cellular heterogeneity among organoids， revealing two so far uncharacterized organoid subtypes， âgobloidsâ and spheroids， predominantly consisting of respectively Muc2+ goblet and Ly6a+ stem cells. Further Disco data analysis thereby revealed strongly increased Yap1 target gene expression in these spheroids， suggesting mechano sensing as the underlying mechanism for their spontaneous formation.  Together， our novel âno-cell-left-behindâ platform enables the deterministic processing of input cells， allowing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity among rare cells or individual， small tissues or organoids.Together， our novel âno-cell-left-behindâ platform enables the deterministic processing of input cells， allowing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity among rare cells or individual， small tissues or organoids.,To benchmark the cell recovery efficiency of the Fluidigm C1 platform， HEK 293T (ATCC Cat.

An epigenetic program established by gene â environment interactions initiates pancreatic carcinogenesis [ATACSeq_shBrd4],GSE162368,Mus musculus,Damaged tissues have increased risk of cancer development through poorly understood mechanisms. In the pancreas， tissue damage collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to dramatically accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and ultimately pancreatic cancer. By integrating genomics， single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally-controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous mouse models， we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a unique chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is selected for throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges within 48 hours of pancreatic injury， and involves large-scale chromatin accessibility changes that contribute to the early dysregulation of genes defining human pancreatic cancer. Among the genes most rapidly activated by tissue damage in the pre-malignant pancreatic epithelium is the alarmin cytokine IL33， which cooperates with mutant Kras in unleashing the epigenetic remodeling program of early neoplasia and neoplastic transformation in the absence of injury. Collectively， our study demonstrates how gene-environment interactions can rapidly produce gene regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment and provides a molecular framework for understanding the interplay between genetics and environmental cues in cancer initiation.,Characterization of the chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) profiles of bulk lineage-traced Kras-mutant pancreatic epithelial cells expressing shRen.713 or shBrd4.552， isolated by FACS-sorting from pancreata of on dox KCsh mice subjected to caerulein treatment (Kras*+Injury condition).,33536616,Nature

The ETS Transcription Factor ERF Controls the Exit from the Embryonic Rosette-stage of Pluripotency [RNAseq],GSE162579,Mus musculus,The naÃ¯ve epiblast undergoes a transition to a pluripotent primed state during embryo implantation. Interestingly， a distinct intermediate stage during the naÃ¯ve-to-primed transition has been recently described， the rosette stage. We propose the transcriptional repressor ERF as the MAPK-dependent switch that controls the exit from the rosette-stage of pluripotency. By using inducible ESC to genetically eliminate all RAS proteins， we show that， while differentiated RasKO ESC are reminiscent of the pluripotent rosette-stage， the absence of ERF overcomes the developmental blockage of RAS-deficient cells from this intermediate state. RNAseq data revealed that deletion of ERF restored the overall gene expression profile to a wild-type level in differentiated RasKO ESC. Mechanistically， ERF ensures naÃ¯ve pluripotency by strengthening naÃ¯ve pluripotent transcription factor binding and accessibility at specific ESC enhancers. Moreover， ERF regulates negatively the expression of the DNMT3 de novo methylases， which are essential for the extinction of the naÃ¯ve transcriptional program. Our data revealed an essential role for ERF in the exit from rosette pluripotency as a regulator of the progression to primed pluripotency.,RNAseq of untreated and OHT-treated Raslox/lox， ERFKO， RasKO， and RasKO; ERFKO ESC cultured in naÃ¯ve conditions (2iL) or induced to differentiate to EpiLSC (FA) for 48 hours.,nan,
Synthetic genomic reconstitution reveals principles of mammalian Hox cluster regulation [ChIP-Seq],GSE190892,Mus musculus,Precise Hox gene expression is crucial for embryonic patterning. Local transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have emerged as the major regulatory modes controlling the initiation and maintenance of Hox gene expression. However， quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here， we introduce âsynthetic regulatory reconstitutionâ， a novel conceptual framework for studying gene regulation and apply it to the mammalian HoxA cluster. To measure the HoxA intrinsic regulatory potential and distal enhancer contributions， we de novo synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130-170 kilobases each) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We find that a minimal HoxA cluster lacking distal enhancers induces the appropriate gene set and establishes distinct chromatin domains in response to patterning signals， while distal enhancers are required for full transcriptional output. These results suggest that the genomically compact Hox clusters contain all the information to decode patterning signals and maintain positional information,ChIP-Seq was used to investigate chromatin boundary formation in synthetic Hox cluster variants during ESC-to-MN differentiation,nan,
Bulk RNA seq of NGP cells,GSE144930,Homo sapiens,Technological advances in transcriptome sequencing of single cells provided an unprecedented view on tissue composition and cellular heterogeneity. While several studies have compared different single cell RNA-seq methods with respect to data quality and their ability to distinguish cellular  subpopulations， none of these comparative studies investigated the heterogeneity of the cellular transcriptional response upon a chemical perturbation. In this study， we evaluated the transcriptional response of NGP neuroblastoma cells upon nutlin-3 treatment using the C1， ddSeq and Chromium single cell systems. These systems and library preparation methods are representative for the wide variety of platforms， ranging from microfluids chips to droplet-based systems and from full transcript sequencing to 3â end sequencing. In parallel， we used bulk RNA-seq for molecular characterization of the transcriptional response. Two complementary metrics to evaluate performance were applied: the first is the number and identification of differentially expressed genes as robustly assessed by two statistical models， and the second is enrichment analysis of biological signals， which is independent of sample size or number of cells evaluated. Where relevant， we downsampled sequencing library size， selected cell subpopulations based on specific RNA abundance features， or created pseudobulk samples to make the data more comparable. While the C1 detects the highest number of genes per cell and better resembles bulk RNA-seq， the Chromium identifies most differentially expressed genes， albeit still substantially fewer than bulk RNA-seq. Gene set enrichment analyses reveals that detection of the most abundant genes in single cell RNA-seq experiments is sufficient for molecular phenotyping. Finally， single cell RNA-seq reveals a heterogeneous response of NGP cells upon nutlin-3 treatment， pinpointing putative late-responders or resistant cells， hidden in bulk RNA-seq experiments.,Bulk RNA sequencing of Nutlin-3 and vehicle treated cells on Illumina Nextseq 500 (Illumina)**Please note that one merged normalized count table (count_data.xlsx) was generated from both scRNA-seq and bulk-RNA seq dataset and is linked to the scRNA-seq records.,nan,

Here， we optimize single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) to map skeletal muscle cell-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes in frozen human and rat samples， and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to map cell-specific transcriptomes in human. We additionally perform multi-omics profiling (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) on human and rat muscle samples. We capture type I and type II muscle fiber signatures， which are generally missed by existing single-cell RNA-seq methods.

Transcriptional profiling of canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma,GSE175876,Canis lupus familiaris,Ameloblastomas are odontogenic tumors that are rare in people but have a relatively high prevalence in dogs. Because canine acanthomatous ameloblastomas (CAA) have clinicopathologic and molecular features in common with human ameloblastomas (AM)， spontaneous CAA can serve as a useful translational model of disease. However， the molecular basis of CAA and how it compares to AM are incompletely understood. In this study， we compared the global genomic expression profile of CAA with AM and evaluated their dental origin by using a bulk RNA-seq approach. For these studies， healthy gingiva (HGIN) and canine oral squamous cell carcinoma (COSCC) served as controls. We found that aberrant RAS signaling， and activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition cellular program are involved in the pathogenesis of CAA， and that CAA is enriched with genes known to be upregulated in AM including those expressed during the early stages of tooth development， suggesting a high level of molecular homology. These results support the model that domestic dogs with spontaneous CAA have potential for pre-clinical assessment of targeted therapeutic modalities against AM.,A total of 25 canine tissue samples， representing 12 CAA， 8 COSCC and 5 HGIN samples， were profiled with RNA-seq.

Deeply hidden genome organization mediated by base-unpairing regions (BURs) directly bound by SATB1 linked to transcription,GSE191146,Mus musculus,Mammalian genomes are organized by multi-layered chromatin folding. How three-dimensional genome organization contributes to cell-type specific transcription remains unclear. We uncover genomic elements termed base-unpairing regions (BURs)， distributed genome-wide， as the sole and direct targets of cell-type specific SATB1 protein in vivo. The SATB1 direct-binding profile was generated by analyzing stringently-purified genomic DNA crosslinked to its directly-bound proteins only (ureaChIP-seq). Furthermore， a SATB1-bound BUR interacts extensively and frequently over the entire 5.7 megabase gene-rich region within many regulatory regions， including those near SATB1-dependent Rag1/Rag2 genes. SATB1 depletion leads to major loss of these interactions with greatly reduced Rag1/Rag2 expression. Most BURs reside within lamina associated domains (LADs)， among which SATB1 binds to cell-type specific groups of BURs. Genome organization mediated by CTCF and SATB1 are distinct as these proteins do not co-bind chromatin in vivo and their direct binding sites are mutually exclusive genome-wide. These results revealed a previously undetected chromatin organization mediated by SATB1 direct binding to selected BURs genome-wide and suggest that chromatin interactions from some of these BURs provide a regulatory network underlying cell-type specific gene expression.,Studying genome-wide binding and chromatin interaction profiles of SATB1 using urea-purified crosslinked chromatin,nan,

MicroRNA-101-3p Modulates Mitochondrial Metabolism via the Regulation of Complex II Assembly,GSE180331,Homo sapiens,MicroRNA-101 (miR-101) is a tumour suppressor that regulates cancer proliferation and apoptotic signalling. Loss of miR-101 increases the expression of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) subunit enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)， resulting in alterations to the epigenome and enhanced tumorigenesis. MiR-101 has also been shown to modulate various aspects of cellular metabolism， however little is known about the mechanisms involved. To investigate the metabolic pathways that are regulated by miR-101， we performed transcriptome and functional analyses of osteosarcoma cells overexpressing miR-101. We found that miR-101 downregulates multiple mitochondrial processes， including oxidative phosphorylation， pyruvate metabolism， the citric acid cycle and phospholipid metabolism.

Caveolin-1 and Sox-2 are Predictive Biomarkers of Cetuximab Response in Head and Neck Cancer,GSE183881,Homo sapiens,Expression analysis (RNA-seq) and RPPA data (see publication) of head and neck cancer patient-derived xenographs (PDXs) revealed Sox-2 and Cav-1 expression to be biomarker determinants of head and neck cancer patient tumor response to cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) treatment.,"Total RNA was extracted from 69 whole PDX tumors using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturerâs instructions (only 65 were retained for downstream analyses). Total RNA was enriched for poly-A transcripts and sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 platform (100PE) at the QB3-Berkeley Genomics center at UC Berkeley. Following sequencing， the unaligned reads contained a mix of human stroma， mouse germline， viral and ostensibly other sequences. Hence， prior to mapping to human reference and expression counting， reads were classified to a probable source. For convenience， each sample had been previously split between two fastq files. Adapters were trimmed and reads failing QC removed using fastp (v0.20.0). Reads were classified as ""human，"" ""mouse，"" ""both，"" ""neither"" and ""ambiguous"" using Xenome (v1.0.0)， a k-mer index based pseudoaligner， with each sample's split files classified independently of each other. Only reads classified as uniquely human progressed to the human expression pipeline. Uniquely human reads were merged into a single fastq file for each sample and next aligned against a ribosomal reference using bwa， removing rRNA matches. Finally， remaining reads were mapped against an Ensembl GRCh38.90 reference. Expression counts were estimated using RSEM (v1.3.1) (see processed TPM file).",34546978,JCI Insight
Perturb-Seq using T2D islets,GSE137766,Homo sapiens,Type 2 diabetes is associated with defective insulin secretion and reduced Î²-cell mass. Available treatments provide a temporary reprieve， but secondary failure rates are high， making insulin supplementation necessary. Reversibility of b-cell failure is a key translational question. Here， we reverse-engineered and interrogated pancreatic islet-specific regulatory networks to discover T2D-specific subpopulations characterized by metabolic-inflexibility and endocrine-progenitor/stem cell features. Single-cell gain- and loss-of-function and glucose-induced Ca++ flux analyses of top candidate MR in islet cells validated transcription factor BACH2 and associated epigenetic effectors as a key driver of T2D cell states. BACH2 knockout in T2D islets reversed cellular features of the disease， restoring a non-diabetic phenotype. BACH2-immunoreactive islet cells increased ~4-fold in diabetic patients， confirming the algorithmic prediction of clinically relevant subpopulations. Treatment with a BACH inhibitor lowered glycemia and increased plasma insulin levels in diabetic mice， and restored insulin secretion in diabetic mice and human islets. The findings suggest that T2D-specific populations of failing b-cells can be reversed and indicate pathways for pharmacological intervention， including via BACH2 inhibition.,Adenovirus encoding CAS9_gRNAs targetting candidate TF with its corresponding DNA guide-barcode was infected in human T2D islets which are subjected to scRNA-seq.,34907913,J Clin Invest

Enzymatic transfer of acetate on histones from lysine reservoir sites to lysine activating sites (RNA-Seq),GSE189444,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Histone acetylation， a post-translational modification associated with transcriptional activation， is governed by nuclear acetyl-CoA pools that can vary depending on the metabolic state of the cell. The metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) is proposed to regulate nuclear acetyl-CoA levels， using local acetate to produce acetyl-CoA that is utilized for histone acetylation. We hypothesize that during gene activation， a local transfer of intact acetate occurs between histones to upregulate transcription via sequential action of epigenetic and metabolic enzymes. Here we present converging lines of evidence in support of this acetate transfer to serve rapid gene induction. Using stable isotope labeling， we detect local transfer of intact acetate between histone acetylation sites both in vitro using purified mammalian enzymes and in vivo using quiescence exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a change-of-state model. We delineate the enzymatic components required for this transfer mechanism， finding that ACSS2， histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase enzymes are necessary for efficient acetyl-group transfer in vitro. We show that Acs2， the yeast orthologue of ACSS2， is recruited to the genome during quiescence exit， and observe dynamic changes of histone acetylation in the vicinity of Acs2 peaks in vivo. Strikingly， we find that Acs2 is preferentially associated with the most upregulated growth genes， suggesting that acetyl-group transfer might play an important role in increased gene expression. Overall， our data reveal direct transfer of acetate between histone lysine residues to facilitate rapid transcriptional induction， an exchange that may be critical during metabolic alterations and changes in nutrient availability.,RNA-seq in a time-course in S. cerevisiae during quiescence exit. Four time points are measured: glucose-deprived quiescent cells (Q)， 30 min post-quiescence exit (E30)， 240 min post-quiescence exit (E240)， and logarithmic growth (LOG).

Single-cell reconstruction with spatial context of migrating neural crest cells and their microenvironments during vertebrate head and neck formation,GSE146809,Gallus gallus,The dynamics of multipotent neural crest cell differentiation andinvasion as cells travel throughout the vertebrate embryo remainunclear. Here， we preserve spatial information to derive thetranscriptional states of migrating neural crest cells and the cellularlandscape of the first four chick cranial to cardiac branchial arches(BA1-4) using label-free， unsorted single-cell RNA sequencing. Thefaithful capture of branchial arch-specific genes led to identificationof novel markers of migrating neural crest cells and 266 invasiongenes common to all BA1-4 streams. Perturbation analysis of a smallsubset of invasion genes and time-lapse imaging identified theirfunctional role to regulate neural crest cell behaviors.

Gibberellins regulate ovule number through a DELLA-CUC2 complex in Arabidopsis,GSE178414,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ovule development is a key process for plant reproduction that ensures correct seed production. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control ovule formation will also provide new approaches to increase crop yield for breeding. Several molecular factors and plant hormones， including gibberellins， are involved in ovule initiation and development. Gibberellins control ovule development by the destabilization of DELLA proteins， whereas DELLA activity has been proved to act as a positive factor for ovule primordia emergence. But the molecular mechanism by which DELLA act remained unknown. Here we have proved that DELLA proteins control ovule initiation by the formation of a protein complex with the CUC2 transcription factor. The DELLA protein GAI requires CUC2 to promote ovule primordia formation， thus GAI would function by its direct protein-protein interaction with CUC2 in cells of the placenta that determine the boundary regions between ovules during pistil development. Analysis of GAI-CUC2 interaction and colocalization in placenta support this hypothesis. Moreover， molecular analysis of the loci at which GAI protein may act as transcriptional co-regulators in a CUC2-dependent manner identified a subset of target genes that would be regulated by the GAI-CUC2 complex and contribute to regulate ovule primordia emergence.,ChIP-Seq of chromatin from inflorescences of pGAI:gaiâ17-3xYPet， pGAI:gaiâ17-3xYPet cuc2-1， and non-transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants.,35192733,Plant J

HOXB8 counteracts MAPK/ERK oncogenic signaling in a chicken embryo model of neoplasia,GSE182076,Gallus gallus,HOX transcription factors are members of an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins required for the establishment of the anteroposterior body axis during bilaterian development.  Although they are often deregulated in cancers， the molecular mechanisms by which they act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes are only partially understood. Since the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is deregulated in most cancers， we aimed at apprehending if and how Hox proteins interact with ERK oncogenicity.   Using an in vivo neoplasia model in the chicken embryo that we have developed， consisting in the overactivation of the ERK1/2 kinases in the trunk neural tube， we analyzed the consequences of HOXB8 gain of function at morphological and transcriptional level in this model. We found that HOXB8 acts as a tumor suppressor， counteracting ERK-induced neoplasia. HOXB8 tumor suppressor function in this model relies on a large reversion of the oncogenic transcriptome induced by ERK. In addition to showing that HOXB8 protein controls the transcriptional responsiveness to ERK oncogenic signaling， our study identified new downstream targets of ERK oncogenic activation in an in vivo context that could provide clues for therapeutic strategies.,Neural tube in ovo electroporations were performed at HH11.

Human cortical organoids with engineered microglia-like cells [CROP-seq],GSE175721,Homo sapiens,Microglia play vital roles in the emergence and preservation of a healthy brain microenvironment with their impaired functions highlighted in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However， investigating the microglia function in health and disease states has been challenging due to the lack of easily accessible human models. Here， we develop a method to generate functional microglia inside human cortical organoids (hCOs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and apply this system to dissect the role of microglia under inflammation induced by amyloid-ï¢ (Aï¢). The overexpression of the myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 generated microglia-like cells in hCOs， producing mhCOs (microglia-containing hCOs) and engrafted in the mouse brain. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals that mhCOs acquire a microglia cell cluster with an intact complement/chemokine system. Functionally， microglia in mhCOs protect parenchyma from cellular and molecular damage caused by Aï¢.  Aï¢-induced expression of genes associated with apoptosis， ferroptosis， and Alzheimerâs disease (AD) stage III genes was attenuated in mhCOs. Finally， we determined the function of AD-associated genes highly expressed in microglia in response to Aï¢ by using pooled CRISPRi coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing in mhCOs. Together， mhCOs represent an innovative platform to investigate neurodegenerative disorders and serve to develop therapeutics in the future.,Single-cell CRISPRi Screening of microglia-like cells containing cortical organoids,35058453,Nat Commun
RpoN is required for a functional type III secretion system in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis,GSE195976,Yersinia pseudotuberculosis,One milliliter of triplicate bacterial cultures in both Wild type (WT) and rpoN mutant were immediately pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 rpm at room temperature for 2 minutes after adding phenol:ethanol. The supernatant were removed and the pellets resuspended in 0.5 ml Trizol solution.For Gram-negative bacteria， the cells were homogenized in Trizol solution by pipetting up and down 15 times. For Gram-positive bacteria， culture suspensions in Trizol were transferred to previously cooled bead beater tubes containing 0.1-mm glass beads and treated with Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products Inc， USA) twice at a fixed speed for 45 seconds， and then cooled on ice for 1 minute between the treatments.Culture homogenates were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes and then supplemented with 0.2 ml chloroform， thoroughly mixed by shaking 10 times， and incubated for 3 minutes. After centrifugation at 12 000 g at 4Â°C for 15 minutes， the aqueous upper phase was carefully transferred to new RNase free tubes. An equal volume of 99% ethanol was added to the transferred aqueous phase and isolation continued using the Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep Plus (Zymo Research， USA) RNA purification kit protocol.Total RNAs were eluted in RNase free water in RNase free tubes. The total RNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit BR RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific， USA) and RNA integrity confirmed on a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE buffer. All rRNA-depleted RNA-seq library preparations were performed according to Shishkin et al.，2015 with minor modifications. RNAtag-Seq allows multiple library preparations in one tube， with initial tagging of total RNA samples with modified (5'P and 3'ddC) DNA barcoded adaptors， each harboring a unique 8 nt sequence used to demultiplex individual libraries after sequencingWe combined the library preparation of three biological replicates from WT and ârpon preparations in one tube for each bacterial strain. Therefore， 24 unique barcoded adaptors were used to tag the 24 replicates. A total of 100 ng total RNA was used for each biological replicate. The total RNA was fragmented in 2X FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase buffer for 3 minutes at 94Â°C， DNase treated， and dephosphorylated with a combination of TURBO DNase and Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase in 1X FastAP buffer for 30 minutes at 37Â°C. Fragmented， DNase-treated， and dephosphorylated total RNAs were cleaned with a 2X reaction volume of Agencourt RNAClean XP beads. Cleaned total RNAs were incubated with 100 pmol of a unique DNA barcode adaptor at 70Â°C for 3 minutes， and then ligated with T4 RNA ligase 1 for 90 minutes at 22Â°C.The ligation was stopped and the enzyme denatured by the addition of RLT buffer. The 36 denatured ligation mixes were then pooled and cleaned in a Zymo Clean & ConcentratorTM-5 column according to the manufacturer's 200 nt cut-off protocol. The RNAs were eluted in 32 ml of RNase free water. The ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Ribo-ZeroTM Magnetic Gold Kit (Bacteria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA of each pool was generated using an AffinityScript Multiple Temperature cDNA synthesis kit with 50 pmol of AR2 primer at 55Â°C for 55 minutes. The RNA was degraded by adding a 10% reaction volume of 1 N NaOH at 70Â°C for 12 minutes and the reaction neutralized with an 18% reaction volume of 0.5 M acetic acid. After cleaning the reverse transcription primers with a 2X reaction volume of RNAClean XP beads， the 3Tr3 adapter was ligated with T4 RNA ligase 1 at 22Â°C with overnight incubation. The second ligation was cleaned first with a 2X， and secondly 1.5X， reaction volume of RNAClean XP beads. The cDNA was then used as the template for PCR reaction with FailSafeTM PCR enzyme mix using 12.5 pmol 2P_univP5 as forward primers and 12.5 pmol ScriptSeqTM Index (barcode) PCR primers as reverse primers. The PCR cycles were as follows: 95Â°C for 3 minutes， followed by 12 cycles at 95Â°C for 30 seconds， 55Â°C for 30 seconds， and 68Â°C for 3 minutes， and then finishing at 68Â°C for 7 minutes.

CROP-seq of hiPSC-derived astrocytes (bulk RNA-Seq),GSE182307,Homo sapiens,In response to central nervous system injury or disease， astrocytes become reactive， adopting context-dependent states with altered functions. Certain inflammatory insults induce reactive astrocyte states that lose homeostatic functions and gain neurotoxicity， and likely contribute to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However， the cellular pathways controlling these states are not fully understood. Here， we combined single-cell transcriptomics with CRISPRi screening in human iPSC-derived astrocytes to systematically interrogate inflammatory reactivity. We found that autocrine-paracrine IL-6 and interferon signaling downstream of canonical NF-kB activation drove two distinct inflammatory reactive states dependent on STAT3 and IRF1， respectively. Furthermore， these states corresponded with those observedÂ in other experimental contexts， including in vivo， and their markers were upregulated in the human brain in Alzheimer's disease and ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy.

Stable VviNAC33 overexpressing transgenic plants displayed an obvious degreening effect on leaves and an inhibition of leaf growth. Consistently， transgenic plant expressing a chimeric repressor of the VviNAC33 showed the opposite phenotypic alterations.

Rapid and robust directed differentiation of mouse epiblast stem cells into definitive endoderm and forebrain organoids II,GSE189870,Mus musculus,Mouse is the pre-eminent model system for studying genetic regulation of embryonic development. Directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has emerged as a powerful complement to in vivo studies of development， allowing for examination of developmental mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level. However， the limited availability of high-quality protocols for directed differentiation of mouse PSCs into defined lineages and organoids has prevented the widespread application of mouse PSC directed differentiation models. Here， we examine the potential of mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) cultured in media containing Wnt pathway inhibitors (primed ground state conditions) as a starting point for directed differentiation. First， we systematically optimized conditions to generate definitive endoderm that are significantly faster and more efficient than current state-of-the-art protocols for mouse PSCs. Second， we developed a robust protocol for generation of forebrain-patterned organoids. These new models can complement and empower in vivo studies in the mouse and can inform human PSC-based studies of development， which cannot readily be compared to analogous stages in vivo.,Day 12 mouse forebrain organoids were dissociated into single cells with accutase， washed with PBS and used for scRNA-seq (10x Genomics， Single Cell 3' Kit v3.1， dual index),35899604,Development

An epigenetic program established by gene â environment interactions initiates pancreatic carcinogenesis [ATACSeq_rIL33],GSE162367,Mus musculus,Damaged tissues have increased risk of cancer development through poorly understood mechanisms. In the pancreas， tissue damage collaborates with activating mutations in the Kras oncogene to dramatically accelerate the formation of early neoplastic lesions and ultimately pancreatic cancer. By integrating genomics， single-cell chromatin assays and spatiotemporally-controlled functional perturbations in autochthonous mouse models， we show that the combination of Kras mutation and tissue damage promotes a unique chromatin state in the pancreatic epithelium that distinguishes neoplastic transformation from normal regeneration and is selected for throughout malignant evolution. This cancer-associated epigenetic state emerges within 48 hours of pancreatic injury， and involves large-scale chromatin accessibility changes that contribute to the early dysregulation of genes defining human pancreatic cancer. Among the genes most rapidly activated by tissue damage in the pre-malignant pancreatic epithelium is the alarmin cytokine IL33， which cooperates with mutant Kras in unleashing the epigenetic remodeling program of early neoplasia and neoplastic transformation in the absence of injury. Collectively， our study demonstrates how gene-environment interactions can rapidly produce gene regulatory programs that dictate early neoplastic commitment and provides a molecular framework for understanding the interplay between genetics and environmental cues in cancer initiation.,Characterization of the chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC-seq) of bulk lineage-traced Kras-mutant pancreatic epithelial cells isolated by FACS-sorting from pancreata of KC (p48-Cre;RIK;LSLKrasG12D) mice treated with murine recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) or PBS.,33536616,Nature
SETDB1/NSD dependent H3K9me3/H3K36me3 dual heterochromatin maintains gene expression profiles by bookmarking poised enhancers,GSE171749,Mus musculus,Gene silencing by heterochromatin plays crucial roles in cell identity and development. However， the function of heterochromatin components is not fully understood. Here， we characterize the localization， the biogenesis and the function of an atypical heterochromatin， which is simultaneously enriched in the typical heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 as well as in H3K36me3， histone mark usually associated with gene expression. This dual heterochromatin forms on 3，015 regions in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells and relies on the histone methyltransferases SET Domain Bifurcated 1 (SETDB1) and Nuclear Set Domain containing proteins (NSD) to generate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3， respectively. Upon SETDB1 removal， dual domains loose both trimethyl marks， gain epigenomic signatures of active enhancers， and come into long range contact with upregulated genes， suggesting that it is a major pathway by which gene expression is controlled by heterochromatin. In differentiated tissues， a large subset of these dual domains is destabilized and become enriched in active enhancer marks， providing a mechanistic insight into the involvement of heterochromatin in development and the maintenance of cell identity.,Characterization of H3K9me3/H3K36me3 dual heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells using ChIP-seq， CIDOP-seq， RNA-seq， ATAC-seq and HiC methods,35081363,Mol Cell
Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) regulates ESR1 action in breast cancer,GSE186004,Homo sapiens,Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a key regulator of transcriptional responses to proteotoxic stress. It has been recently linked to signaling of estrogen via ESR1. To study the cooperation of HSF1 and ESR1 in the transcriptional response to estrogen， we established estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines with reduced HSF1 levels using specific shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 approach. HSF1 deficiency led to the inhibition of the mitogenic effect of estrogen in MCF7 and T47D cells. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the stimulatory effect of E2 on the transcriptome was smaller in HSF1-deficient MCF7 cells. This could partially result from the higher basal expression of E2-dependent genes in these cells as a consequence of the enhanced binding of unliganded ESR1 to chromatin， which was revealed by ChIP-seq analyses. Thus， we postulate that some fraction of ESR1 could be released from the inhibitory complex with HSP90 and gain transcriptional competence without E2-stimulation.,MCF7 cells with different status of HSF1 (HSF1+/+ and HSF1-/-) were untreated or treated with 10 nM E2 for 4 hour. Then total RNA was isolated from each sample using the Direct-ZolTM RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research)， digested with DNase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and next-generation sequenced using the Illumina protocol. For each experimental point， three independent biological repeats were done including RNA isolation and sequencing.,34783649,Elife
AhR links air pollution and atopic dermatitis via Artemin induction,GSE72449,Mus musculus,Atopic dermatitis is increasing worldwide， correlating with air pollutions. Various organic components of pollutants activate transcription factor AhR (aryl-hydrocarbon receptor). We have established AhR-CA mice， whose keratinocytes express constitutive-active AhR， and these mice developed atopic dermatitis-like frequent scratching and allergic inflammation. In this study we performed ChIP-seq analyses and identified keratinocyte-specific AhR target genes， including inflammatory cytokines Tslp and IL33， and neurotrophic factor Artemin. While AhR-CA mice exhibited epidermal hyperinnervation and alloknesis leading to hypersensitivity to pruritus， blockade of Artemin alleviated these phenotypes. AhR-CA mice showed scratching-induced barrier insufficiency and enhanced sensitization to epicutaneously-applied antigens， recapitulating human atopic dermatitis. Consistently， AhR activation and Artemin expression was detected in the epidermis of atopic dermatitis patients and keratinocytes exposed to air pollutants. Thus， AhR in keratinocytes senses the environmental stimuli and responds to them through moderating inflammation. We propose a mechanism in which air pollution induces atopic dermatitis through AhR activation.,Gene expression in epidermis obtained from wild-type and AhRCA neonates. In AhRCA mice， constitutive active form of AhR transcription factor is expressed under the control of keratin 14 promoter. Three independent samplings were performed， and each sampling includes RNA from one AhRCA mice and one littermate wild-type mice， respectively.,27869817,Nat Immunol
Interdependencies of Intratumoral Genetic Heterogeneity and the Immune Microenvironment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Bulk RNA),GSE161711,Homo sapiens,The tumor microenvironment (TME) and somatic mutations drive progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Integrated bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of paired peripheral blood (PB) and lymph node (LN) samples from patients with treatment naÃ¯ve CLL showed upregulation of oncogenic processes in LN attributable to a minor population of activated tumor cells. A 10-gene activated tumor signature was positively correlated with activated CD4+ T cells and M2 macrophages in the TME. Whole exome sequencing of paired PB and LN samples showed subclonal expansion in LN in some patients. In remaining patients with clonal stability between PB and LN， a T-cell inflamed TME was detected by RNA-seq. These data connect the TME with molecular events in the pathogenesis of CLL.,Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of (1) immunomagnetically purified CD19+ cells from peripheral blood (n = 29)， (2) CD19+ cells from lymph node single cell suspensions (n = 29)， and (3) lymph node biopsies (n = 38).

Smc3 acetylation， Pds5 and Scc2 control the translocase activity that establishes cohesin dependent chromatin loops,GSE186987,Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303,Cohesin is a DNA translocase instrumental in the folding of the genome into chromatin loops， with functional consequences on DNA-related processes. Chromatin loop length and organization likely depend on cohesin processivity， translocation rate， and stability on DNA. Here we investigate and provide a comprehensive overview of the roles of various cohesin regulators in tuning chromatin loop expansion. We demonstrate that Scc2， which stimulates cohesin ATPase activity， is also essential for cohesin translocation， driving loop expansion in vivo. Smc3 acetylation during S-phase counteracts this activity through the stabilization of Pds5， which finely tunes the size and stability of loops in G2.,Examination of cohesin subunit occupancy on genome in the presence of non acetylable Smc3-RR and analysis of 3D chromosome configuration using HiC methods and yeast mutants,35710835,Nat Struct Mol Biol
TGF-Î² signaling activated by cancer-associated fibroblasts determines the histological signature of lung adenocarcinoma,GSE169029,Homo sapiens,Invasive lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) is classified histologically as lepidic， acinar， papillary， micropapillary， or solid. We found that A549 human LADC cells formed tumors with distinct histological featuresâsolid-type or acinar-type tumorsâdepending on the site of development in immunodeficient mice and that a solid-to-acinar transition (SAT) could be induced by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in 3D cocultures with A549. To clarify the molecular mechanisms contributing to SAT induction， we performed RNA-seq analysis of four A549 tumor cell samples derived from solid- or acinar-type tumor tissue formed in vivo or from 3D tumor colonies formedÂ in the presence or absence of CAFs in vitro.,RNA-seq analysis of A549 cells isolated from solid-type or acinar-type tumors in immunodeficient mice by laser microdissection and  A549 cells isolated from 3D cocultures in the presence or absence of CAFs by cell sorting.,34289987,Cancer Res

Whole-transcriptome analysis and construction of ceRNA-miRNA-target gene regulatory networks in anther development of Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. pekinensis) [Anther & mixed parts miRNA-seq],GSE171706,Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis,Anther development is a complex process， and the study of its molecular mechanism has an important impact on plant breeding. This study aims to identify microRNA (miRNA)， mRNA， long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)， and circular RNA (circRNA) related to anther development of Chinese cabbage， so as to construct competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks and provide valuable knowledge for the exploration of pollen development mechanism of Chinese cabbage. A total of 9055 mRNA， 585 miRNA， 1344 lncRNA， and 165 circRNA were identified as differentially expressed in the anther of Chinese cabbage compared with Mix (roots， stems and leaves) by whole-transcriptome sequencing. The anther-related ceRNA-miRNA-target gene regulatory network through miRNA targeting relationships was constructed and 450 pairs of ceRNA relationships， including 97 DEmiRNA-DEmRNA， 281 DEmiRNA-DElncRNA， and 23 DEmiRNA-DEcircRNA interactions were obtained in Chinese cabbage. The genes in the ceRNA network were enriched in the pathways including starch and sucrose metabolism， carbon metabolism， pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms， plant hormone signal transduction， and RNA degradation.

Reducedfemalefertility duetosequestration ofRNA Pol II by pervasive transcription in exosome RNasedepleted oocytes,GSE196331,Mus musculus,We performed mouse single oocyte RNA-seq and bulk oocyte CUT&Tag assays in the current project. In details， SMART-seq based single oocyte RNA-seq was performed at adult GV stage， GV3h stage and MII stage， using control and Dis3 oocyte-speicfic knockout (cKO) oocytes. RiboMinus-seq based single oocyte RNA-seq was performed at adult GV stage using control and Dis3 cKO oocytes， and at p20 GV stage using control， Dis3 cKO， Exosc10 cKO and Dis3/Exosc10 double cKO (dcKO) oocytes. Bulk CUT&Tag of anti-H3K27me3 was done in WT and Dis3 cKO oocytes at adult GV stage， and in WT and Dis3/Exosc10  dcKO oocytes at p20 stage. In addition， CUT&Tag of anti-RNA polymerase II (Ser2+Ser5) was performed in WT and Dis3 cKO oocytes at GV stage. All CUT&Tag experiments share the same rabbit-Igg negative control.

CROP-seq of hiPSC-derived astrocytes (scRNA-Seq),GSE182308,Homo sapiens,In response to central nervous system injury or disease， astrocytes become reactive， adopting context-dependent states with altered functions. Certain inflammatory insults induce reactive astrocyte states that lose homeostatic functions and gain neurotoxicity， and likely contribute to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However， the cellular pathways controlling these states are not fully understood. Here， we combined single-cell transcriptomics with CRISPRi screening in human iPSC-derived astrocytes to systematically interrogate inflammatory reactivity. We found that autocrine-paracrine IL-6 and interferon signaling downstream of canonical NF-kB activation drove two distinct inflammatory reactive states dependent on STAT3 and IRF1， respectively. Furthermore， these states corresponded with those observedÂ in other experimental contexts， including in vivo， and their markers were upregulated in the human brain in Alzheimer's disease and ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy. These results and the platform we established have the potential to guide the development of therapeutics to selectively modulate different aspects of inflammatory astrocyte reactivity.,hiPSC-derived astrocytes (iAstrocytes) with stable integration of CRISPRi machinery were transduced with a lentiviral sgRNA library in the CROP-seq vector (Datlinger et al， PMID: 28099430) to knockdown a set of genes hypothesized to control inflammatory reactivity. iAstrocytes were then treated with vehilce (Veh) or IL1a+TNF+C1q (ITC) to induce inflammatory reactivity， and then processed for single-cell RNA-sequencing using 10x v3. The sgRNA identities of each cell was recovered by targeted PCR enrichment of poly-adenylated transcripts containing the sgRNA sequence from the 10x cDNA (see Datlinger et al). This dataset includes both the 10x RNA libraries as well as the CROP-seq PCR enrichment libraries.,36303069,Nat Neurosci
Single cell RNA sequencing of Chromium isolated NGP cells,GSE144929,Homo sapiens,Technological advances in transcriptome sequencing of single cells provided an unprecedented view on tissue composition and cellular heterogeneity. While several studies have compared different single cell RNA-seq methods with respect to data quality and their ability to distinguish cellular  subpopulations， none of these comparative studies investigated the heterogeneity of the cellular transcriptional response upon a chemical perturbation. In this study， we evaluated the transcriptional response of NGP neuroblastoma cells upon nutlin-3 treatment using the C1， ddSeq and Chromium single cell systems. These systems and library preparation methods are representative for the wide variety of platforms， ranging from microfluids chips to droplet-based systems and from full transcript sequencing to 3â end sequencing. In parallel， we used bulk RNA-seq for molecular characterization of the transcriptional response. Two complementary metrics to evaluate performance were applied: the first is the number and identification of differentially expressed genes as robustly assessed by two statistical models， and the second is enrichment analysis of biological signals， which is independent of sample size or number of cells evaluated. Where relevant， we downsampled sequencing library size， selected cell subpopulations based on specific RNA abundance features， or created pseudobulk samples to make the data more comparable. While the C1 detects the highest number of genes per cell and better resembles bulk RNA-seq， the Chromium identifies most differentially expressed genes， albeit still substantially fewer than bulk RNA-seq. Gene set enrichment analyses reveals that detection of the most abundant genes in single cell RNA-seq experiments is sufficient for molecular phenotyping. Finally， single cell RNA-seq reveals a heterogeneous response of NGP cells upon nutlin-3 treatment， pinpointing putative late-responders or resistant cells， hidden in bulk RNA-seq experiments.,Single cell RNA sequencing of Nutlin-3 and vehicle treated cells on Chromium (10X Genomics)Please note that one merged normalized count table (count_data.xlsx) was generated from both scRNA-seq and bulk-RNA seq dataset and is linked to the scRNA-seq records.,nan,

External signals regulate continuous transcriptional states in hematopoietic stem cells,GSE165844,Mus musculus,Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must ensure adequate blood cell production following distinct external stressors. A comprehensive understanding of in vivo heterogeneity and specificity of HSC responses to external stimuli is currently lacking. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on functionally validated mouse HSCs and LSK (Lin-， c-Kit+，Sca1+) progenitors after in vivo pharmacological perturbation of niche signals interferon， granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)， and prostaglandin. We identified six HSC states that are characterized by enrichment but not exclusive expression of marker genes. External signals induced rapid transitions between HSC states but transcriptional response varied both between external stimulants and within the HSC population for a given perturbation. In contrast to LSK progenitors， HSCs were characterized by a greater link between molecular signatures at baseline and in response to external stressors. Chromatin analysis of unperturbed HSCs and LSKs by scATAC-Seq suggested some HSC-specific， cell intrinsic predispositions to niche signals. We compiled a comprehensive resource of HSC- and LSK progenitor-specific chromatin and transcriptional features that represent determinants of signal receptiveness and regenerative potential during stress hematopoiesis.,Five male and five female mice were used for each sample. For scATAC-Seq experiment and for HSC replicate 1 scRNA-Seq (HSC_Repl1) mice were left unperturbed. For stimulation scRNA-Seq experiment mice were treated with either 16，16-dimethyl ProstaglandinÂ E2 (dmPGE2)， Poly(I:C) (pIC)， or G-CSF (GCSF)， Indomethacin (indo)， or only solvent DMSO as a control (ct). In this experiment HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) from the same condition (ct， dmPGE2， pIC， GCSF and indo) were extracted from the same mice. The MPP samples were also labeled with hashtag oligonucleotides (HTO) that are part of the Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq) methodology. The two control HSC samples (HSC_Repl1 and HSC_ct = repl2) were treated as two independent biological replicates.,34939923,Elife

circRAB3IP modulates cell proliferation by reorganizing gene expression and mRNA processing in a paracrine manner [HUVEC_KD],GSE199551,Homo sapiens,Circular RNAs are endogenous long-lived and abundant non-coding species. Despite their prevalence， only few circRNAs have been dissected mechanistically as regards their function to date. Here， we catalogued nascent RNA-enriched circRNAs from primary human cells and focus on circRAB3IP to assign to it a role in sustaining cellular homeostasis. We combine âomicsâ and functional experiments to show how circRAB3IP depletion deregulates hundreds of genes， suppress cell cycle progression， and brings about senescence-like gene expression changes. Conversely， excess circRAB3IP delivered to endothelial cells via exosomes suffices for accelerating their cell division. We attribute these effects to widespread changes in isoform usage that stem from the interplay between circRAB3IP and the general splicing factor SF3B1. Together， our findings link the maintenance of cell homeostasis to the tightly regulated titers of a single circRNA.,HUVEC cells pulled from three donors were treated with NTC or circRAB3IP or circCAMSAP1 siRNA.,nan,
Pro-inflammatory cytokine and high doses of ionizing radiation have similar effects on the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes [ChIP-seq],GSE109996,Homo sapiens,The NF-ÎºB transcription factors are activated via diverse molecular mechanisms in response to various types of stimuli. A plethora of functions associated with specific sets of target genes could be regulated differentially by this factor， affecting cellular response to stress including an anticancer treatment. Here we aimed to compare subsets of NF-ÎºB-dependent genes induced in cells stimulated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine and in cells damaged by a high dose of ionizing radiation (4 and 10 Gy). The RelA-containing NF-ÎºB species were activated by the canonical TNFÎ±-induced and the atypical radiation-induced pathways in human osteosarcoma cells. NF-ÎºB-dependent genes were identified using the gene expression profiling (by RNA-Seq) in cells with downregulated RELA combined with the global profiling of RelA binding sites (by ChIP-Seq)， with subsequent validation of selected candidates by quantitative PCR. There were 37 NF-ÎºB-dependent protein-coding genes identified: in all cases RelA bound in their regulatory regions upon activation while downregulation of RELA suppressed their stimulus-induced upregulation， which apparently indicated the positive regulation mode. This set of genes included a few ânovelâ NF-ÎºB-dependent species. Moreover， the evidence for possible negative regulation of ATF3 gene by NF-ÎºB was collected. The kinetics of the NF-ÎºB activation was slower in cells exposed to radiation than in cytokine-stimulated ones. However， subsets of NF-ÎºB-dependent genes upregulated by both types of stimuli were essentially the same. Hence， one should expect that similar cellular processes resulting from activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway could be induced in cells responding to pro-inflammatory cytokines and in cells where so-called âdamage-induced inflammationâ response was initiated by ionizing radiation,We sequenced DNA immunoprecipitated from wild type U2OS cells using rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 antibodies. Cells were untreated (control) or stimulated using TNFalpha cytokine for specific time or subjected to ionizing radiation with subsequent recovery. Six ChIP replicates were collected and pooled per each sequenced sample. Input samples were included as negative control (no DNA enrichment was observed in mock-IP samples).,29476964,Cell Signal

Bulk RNA sequencing on sorted blood cells from Drosophila lymph glands [MZ IZ bulk RNA-seq],GSE168821,Drosophila melanogaster,We report the use of bulk mRNA sequencing on FACS-sorted blood cells to identify new and unique genetic markers for each major zone of the  Drosophila lymph gland. We used flow cytomotery in a wild-type genetic background whihc contains two fluorescent reporters that allow for the separation of 4 distinct populations.  Progenitors of the medullary zone (MZ) are marked by dome-meso-EGFP expression. Differentitating cels of the cortical zone (CZ) are marked by Hml-DsRed. These two sorted populations (MZ and CZ) are positive for the expected zone-specific markers (i.e. Tep4，  dome， and shg for MZ and Hml， Pxn， vkg， Col4a1， and NimC1 for plasmatocytes of the CZ)， however， the CZ population also expresses crystal cell markers (hnt， lz， ProPO)， indicating that it is a mix of plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Intermediate progenitors of the intermediate zone (IZ)， which are not well understood and do not have specific markers， but are characterized by simultaneous expression of EGFP and DsRed (double positives) were also sorted. In addtiion， there is a population of lymph gland cells that is double negative for both EGFP and DsRed fluorescence. This double negative population contains a mix of cell types including posterior signaling center (PSC) cells， MZ and CZ cells that have lost fluorescence， late crystal cells that do not express Hml (early CCs do express)， and non-blood cells (i.e. dorsal vessel and pericardial cells). These double negatives were excluded from the analysis for these reasons. We analyzed transcript data of these 4 sorted populations in the early third instart larvae (90-96 hours after eggs lay at 25 degrees C). We identified novel markers that are differentially expressed in each of the three major blood cell populations (MZ， IZ， CZ) that have been useful to definetely identify populations in scRNA-Seq and give information about transcript isoforms in each of the distinct populations.,Examination of mRNA expression in sorted  blood cell populations,34713801,Elife
Generation of cDC-like cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells via Notch signaling [RNA-Seq],GSE193487,Homo sapiens,Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in regulating the innate and adaptive immune responses， and have long been a major focus of cancer immunotherapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that conventional type 1 DC (cDC1s) excel in cross-presentation of exogenous antigens on MHC-I molecules， and induction of antitumor CD8+ T cell immunity; however， obtaining large numbers of cDC1s is difficult. The use of reprogramming and differentiation technology is advantageous for obtaining unlimited numbers of autologous cDC1s especially for therapeutic interventions where repeated vaccinations are required. However， generation of cDC1s from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) remains elusive.,iPSC-derived DCs and PBMCs were stained with a master mix of antibodies for surface staining including Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead， XCR1， CLEC9A， CD11c and HLA-DR after Fc block with human IgG. CD11c+HLA-DR+CLEC9A+XCR1+ cells were sorted on BD FACSAria II. Total RNA was prepared from these sorted DCs using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).,35101945,J Immunother Cancer
CRISPR activation and interference screens decode stimulation responses in primary human T cells [CRISPRa Perturb-seq],GSE190604,Homo sapiens,Regulation of cytokine production in stimulated T cells can be disrupted in autoimmunity， immunodeficiencies， and cancer. Systematic discovery of stimulation-dependent cytokine regulators requires both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies， which have been challenging in primary human cells. We now report genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) screens in primary human T cells to identify gene networks controlling interleukin 2 and interferon gamma production. Arrayed CRISPRa confirmed key hits and enabled multiplexed secretome characterization， revealing reshaped cytokine responses. Coupling CRISPRa screening with single-cell RNA-seq enabled deep molecular characterization of screen hits， revealing how perturbations tuned T cell activation and promoted cell states characterized by distinct cytokine expression profiles. Together， these screens reveal genes that reprogram critical immune cell functions， which could inform the design of immunotherapies.,Pooled CRISPRa screen coupled with single-cell RNA-seq in human T cells,35113687,Science
The conservation and divergence of epigenitic reprogramming during mammalian early development,GSE163620,Sus scrofa;Bos taurus;Mus musculus;Rattus norvegicus,To explore how parental epigenetic information is transmitted to the next generation across mammals， we systematically investigated the epigenomes of oocytes and early embryos among human， bovine， porcine， rat， and mouse. This unprecedented dataset revealed strikingly diverse， species-specific innovation of epigenetic transition. In oocytes， DNA methylation is restricted to active gene bodies in rodents， allowing methylation of maternal imprints but not intergenic paternal imprints. Strikingly， hypermethylation also occurs in non-transcribed regions in porcine and bovine， where paternal imprints instead reside in hypomethylated， megabase-long âCpG continents (CGCs)â. Despite the presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 domains in non-human oocytes， only rodent H3K27me3 survives beyond genome activation， supporting H3K27me3-mediated imprinting. Coincidently， regulatory elements are segregated away from H3K27me3 domains， the ectopic invasion of which leads to aberrant embryonic transcription. Finally， human does not fully resemble any of the rest species. Hence， mammals invent diverse epigenetic inheritance and reprogramming which center around a delicate balance in establishing imprints while protecting other regulatory regions.,DNA methylomes， H3K4me3， H3K27me3， H3K36me2， H3K36me3 are profiled and analyzed in the gametes and preimplantation embryos among five mammalian species， including human， bovine， porcine， rat and mouse.,34818044,Sci Adv
A human DNA methylation atlas reveals principles of cell type-specific methylation and identifies thousands of cell type-specific regulatory elements,GSE186458,Homo sapiens,DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs chromatin organization， cell identity， and gene expression.

Inner nuclear protein Matrin-3 coordinates cell differentiation by stabilizing chromatin architecture [ChIP-Seq],GSE181231,Mus musculus,Precise control of gene expression during differentiation relies on the interplay of chromatin and nuclear structure. Despite an established contribution of nuclear membrane proteins to developmental gene regulation， little is known regarding the role of inner nuclear proteins. Here we demonstrate that loss of the nuclear scaffolding protein Matrin-3 (Matr3) in erythroid cells leads to morphological and gene expression changes characteristic of accelerated maturation， as well as broad alterations in chromatin organization similar to those accompanying differentiation. Matr3 protein interacts with CTCF and the cohesin complex， and its loss perturbs their occupancy at a subset of sites. Destabilization of CTCF and cohesin binding correlates with altered transcription and accelerated differentiation. This association is conserved in embryonic stem cells. Our findings indicate Matr3 negatively affects cell fate transitions and demonstrate that a critical inner nuclear protein impacts occupancy of architectural factors， culminating in broad effects on chromatin organization and cell differentiation.,Cells were crosslinked and nuclei were prepared for ChIP-seq experiments.Please note that the records were updated with the ESC_*_input_* samples (GSM5687584-GSM5687590) on Nov 11， 2021.,34716321,Nat Commun
KMT2C Loss Promotes Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastasis through DNMT3A-mediated Epigenetic Reprogramming,GSE161570,Mus musculus,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its early and frequent metastases， which contribute to it as a recalcitrant malignancy. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis， we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multi-omics analyses. We found that loss of KMT2C， an H3K4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive stage SCLC， promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically， KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A， a de novo DNA methyltransferase， through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further， S-(5â-Adenosyl)-L-methionine， the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases， inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus， our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis， which suggested a new epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability.,Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine lung malignancy characterized with rapid progress and heavy metastasis. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its unique pathology， we developed a new strategy to rapidly generate driver-defined primary and orthotopical murine SCLC models with gene-edited lung organoids. Single cell transcriptome analyses of primary and metastatic SCLC revealed a metastasis trajectory associated with dysregulated epigenetic programs. Disruption of KMT2C， an H3K4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in human SCLC of extensive stage， promoted the growth and metastasis of SCLC in mice. Interestingly， KMT2C loss resulted in significantly reduced DNA methylation through directly regulating the expression of DNMT3A. Ectopically expressing DNMT3A or treatment with S-adenosyl methionine repressed the metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC. These epigenetic reprogramming exaggerated SCLC metastasis partially through upregulating Meis/Hox genes. Taken together， our study revealed an unprecedented synergistic histone and DNA hypomethylation in SCLC.,35449309,Nat Cancer

Dysregulated myokines and signaling pathways in skeletal muscle dysfunction in a Cigarette Smoke-induced Model of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,GSE197463,Mus musculus,Purpose: To explore myokines and signaling pathways in skeletal muscle dysfunction in a Cigarette Smoke-induced Model of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseMethods: Total RNA was extracted from the muscle tissues using Trizol (Invitrogen， Carlsbad， California， USA) according to manual instruction. About 60 mg of tissues were ground into powder by liquid nitrogen in a 2 mL tube， followed by being homogenized for 2 minutes and rested horizontally for 5 minutes. The mix was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 12，000Ãg at 4Â°C， and then the supernatant was transferred into a new EP tube with 0.3 mL chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The mix was shacked vigorously for 15s， and then centrifuged at 12，000Ãg for 10 minutes at 4Â°C. After centrifugation， the upper aqueous phase where RNA remained was transferred into a new tube with equal volume of supernatant of isopropyl alcohol， then centrifuged at 13，600 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C. After deserting the supernatant， the RNA pellet was washed twice with 1 mL 75% ethanol， and then the mix was centrifuged at 13，600 rpm for 3 minutes at 4Â°C to collect residual ethanol， followed by the pellet air dry for 5-10 minutes in the biosafety cabinet. Finally， 25Î¼L~100Î¼L of DEPC-treated water was added to dissolve the RNA. Subsequently， total RNA was qualified and quantified using a Nano Drop and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific， MA， USA).Results: The sequencing data were filtered with SOAPnuke (v1.5.2) (Li et al.， 2008)by (1) Removing reads containing sequencing adapter; (2) Removing reads whose low-quality base ratio (base quality less than or equal to 5) was more than 20%; (3) Removing reads whose unknown base ('N' base) ratio was more than 5%， and afterwards clean reads were obtained and stored in FASTQ format. The clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using HISAT2 (v2.0.4)(Kim et al.， 2015). Bowtie2 (v2.2.5)(Langmead and Salzberg， 2012) was applied to align the clean reads to the reference coding gene setï¼and then expression level of gene was calculated by RSEM (v1.2.12)(Li and Dewey， 2011). The heatmap was drawn by pheatmap (v1.0.8) according to the gene expression in different samples. Essentially， differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2(v1.4.5) with Q value â¤ 0.05. To take insight to the change of phenotype， GO (http://www.geneontology.org/) and KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/) enrichment analysis of annotated different expressed gene was performed by Phyper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution) based on Hypergeometric test. The significant levels of terms and pathways were corrected by Q value with a rigorous threshold (Q value â¤ 0.05) by Bonferroni.Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes， with biologic replicates， generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.,mRNA profiles of the gastrocnemius muscle of COPD mice,nan,

However， genome-wide study of mRNA was lackingObjective: In this study， we wanted to characterize the range of human mRNAs that undergo transfer to neighbouring mouse cells when co-cultured together for 12 hoursResults: We found that a large part of human mRNAs can traffic to adjoining mouse cells， the number of mRNAs transferred is dependent on gene expression. We also also detected significant differential gene regulation in mouse cells in response to co-culture with human cellsConclusion: In addition to sequencing analysis， we have used molecular biological and imaging techniques to demonstate expression-dependent mRNA transfer from mouse to human cells.,human mRNAs from purified mouse cells are detected after 12-hour of in-vitro co-culture. For control， human and mouse cells were mixed and immediately sorted using antigen-based magnetic sorting (Human cells: MCF7; Mouse cells: MEF).

Gene repression through epigenetic modulation by PPARA enhances hepatocellular proliferation,GSE154277,Mus musculus,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARA) is a key mediator of lipid metabolism and inflammation. Activation of PPARA in rodents causes hepatocyte proliferation， but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study focused on genes repressed by PPARA and analyzed the mechanism by which PPARA promotes hepatocyte proliferation in mice. Activation of PPARA by agonist treatment was autoregulated， and induced expression of the epigenetic regulator UHRF1 via activation of the newly described PPARA target gene E2f8， that in turn regulates Uhrf1. UHRF1 strongly repressed expression of CDH1 via methylation of the Cdh1 promoter marked with H3K9me3. Repression of CDH1 by PPARA activation was reversed by PPARA deficiency or knockdown of E2F8 or UHRF1. Furthermore， forced expression of CDH1 inhibited expression of the Wnt signaling target genes such as Myc after PPARA activation， and suppressed hepatocyte hyperproliferation. These results demonstrate that the PPARA-E2F8-UHRF1-CDH1 axis causes epigenetic regulation of hepatocyte proliferation.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual SeriesRNA-seq:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154275ChIP-seq:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE154276,35479397,iScience
eIF4A2 targets developmental potency and histone H3.3 transcripts for translational control of embryonic and cancer stemness [eCLIP-seq],GSE150680,Mus musculus,Stemness is a defining feature in embryonic and cancer stem cells. How stemness is regulated at the mRNA translational initiation remains undefined. We carried out an RNAi screen for key translation initiation factors that maintain the stemness in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We identified eIF4A2 and defined its mechanistic action through Rps26-depleted and -containing ribosomes in translational initiation activation of mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors and H3.3 for embryonic and extraembryonic lineage repression， respectively. eIF4A2 also mediates translation initiation activation of Ddx6， which acts together with eIF4A2 to restrict the totipotent 2-cell (2C) transcription program in ESCs through Zscan4 mRNA degradation and translation repression. Knockdown of eIF4A2 disrupts ESC proteome causing the loss of stemness in ESCs as well as in human glioblastomas where eIF4A2 is highly enriched. Collectively， our study establishes an eIF4A2-mediated translation initiation control of stemness and provides insight into cancer therapeutics targeting the translation initiation machinery.,eIF4A2 binding profiling was investigated via eCLIP-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells.,35353581,Sci Adv

Cnot8 Eliminates NaÃ¯ve Regulation Networks and Is Essential for NaÃ¯ve-to-Formative Pluripotency Transition [scRNA-Seq],GSE194431,Mus musculus,The transition of mammalian early epiblast at different phases is characterized by the differences of pluripotent states and developmental potential， involving extensive transcriptome changes. However， the role of post-transcriptional RNA degradation modulation in cell fate transition remains largely unexplored. Here， we report that deadenylase Cnot8 of Ccr4-Not complex specifically plays a role in naÃ¯ve-to-formative transition of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Disruption of Cnot8 results in early embryonic lethality， accompanying with the increased expression levels of naÃ¯ve transcription factors in mouse epiblasts. Cnot8 depletion leads to accumulated expression abundances and increased poly(A) tail lengths of massive transcripts including mRNAs of naÃ¯ve regulation networks， impairing the naÃ¯ve-to-formative pluripotency conversion. Mechanistically， Cnot8 interacts with Tob1 and Pabpc1 to guarantee the prompt mRNA deadenylation and degradation of naÃ¯ve regulation networks at specific time. Together， these findings delineate the mechanism underlying PSC fate transition through global degradation of mRNAs for naÃ¯ve regulation networks by Cnot8.,Total 2 scRNA-seq libraries with  wild type and Cnot8 KO ESCs (S/LIF) and 48h-EpiLCs,35390160,Nucleic Acids Res
Physiological and transcriptomic effects of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid in Caenorhabditis elegans during development,GSE205582,Caenorhabditis elegans,Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals that are relatively resistant to degradation. While such features are desirable in a variety of consumer and industry products， such as firefighting foams and non-stick cookware coating， some PFAS， including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)， are toxic and bioaccumulate. Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) is an emerging PFAS developed to replace PFOA and has not been extensively studied. To evaluate the potential toxicity of HFPO-DA with a cost- and time-efficient approach， we exposed C. elegans larvae to 4Ã10-9â4 g/L HFPO-DA in liquid media and performed assays measuring developmental， behavioral， locomotor， and transcriptional effects at various exposure levels. After 48 hours of 1.5â4 g/L HFPO-DA exposure， acute developmental toxicity was observed as developmental delay; statistically significantly delayed (p < 0.05) progeny production was observed in worms exposed to 2â4 g/L HFPO-DA. After 48 hours of 4Ã10-9â0.4 g/L exposure， no significant behavioral or locomotor effect was observed relative to the 0 g/L control group. Statistically significant differential gene expression was identified with over 99% confidence via the R-package NOISeq in all fourteen 48-hour 1.25Ã10Â¬-5â4 g/L HFPO-DA exposure groups， except for 6.25Ã10Â¬-5 g/L. Among 10298 genes analyzed， 2624 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the developmentally delayed 4 g/L group only， and 78 genes were differentially expressed in at least one of the thirteen exposure groups testing 1.25Ã10Â¬-5â2 g/L HFPO-DA exposures. Genes encoding for detoxification proteins such as cytochrome P450 enzymes and UDP glucuronosyltransferases are upregulated in 0.25â4 g/L acute exposure groups. In the lower exposure concentration groups， statistically significant gene expression changes were also observed， though these DEGs did not share any biological functions， except for six ribosomal protein-coding genes. While our transcriptional data is insufficient for conclusive mechanistic explanation， the statistically significant gene expression differences detected at 1.25Ã10Â¬-5 g/L， the lowest concentration tested for transcriptional changes， is concerning and calls for further targeted analyses that focus on low-dose HFPO-DA exposure effects.,Gene expression profiling analysis of shallow RNA-seq data for C. elegans 48 hour exposure to hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA); four replicates of 15 experimental conditions (14 different concentrations of HFPO-DA plus a control) were generated， with each condition containing around 1000 worms,nan,
RNA-seq analyses of mouse retinal pigment epithelium cells,GSE204715,Mus musculus,The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of polarized epithelial cells lying between the retina and the choroid/sclera， with a major function in supporting photoreceptor homeostasis， but the role of RPE in eye size regulation is yet to be further explored. it was recently reported that selective deletion of Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (Lrp2) in the mouse RPE resulted in large eyes， similar to the phenotypes of Lrp2 whole eye knockout mice， suggesting that the RPE is the tissue in which LRP2 functions. Here， to investigate which downstream pathways of Srebp2 and Lrp2 are responsible for regulating eye growth， we performed RNA-seq analysis with the mouse RPE tissues. Postnatal day 0 (P0) mice were injected with AAV8-Best1-GFP/nSrebp2/ctrl sh/Lrp2 sh1/Lrp2 sh2 viruses to overexpress the constitutively active form of Srebp2 or to knockdown Lrp2 in the RPE specifically. At P14， RPE cells were carefully dissociated for RNA extraction. Via RNA-seq analysis and functional validation， we identified that Bmp2 is the target and the effector of the Srebp2-Lrp2 pathway.  Overall， the present study unveils an essential role of RPE in regulating eye size via the Srebp2-Lrp2-Bmp2 signaling pathway， shedding light on the underlying mechanism of eye size control.,Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mRNA profiles of postnatal day 14 mice injected with AAV8-Best1-GFP/nSrebp2/ctrl sh/Lrp2 sh1/Lrp2 sh2 viruses,35833708,Development
JAZF1-SUZ12 dysregulates PRC2 recruitment and gene expression during cell differentiation,GSE169658,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains repression of genes specific for other cell differentiation stages through methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and is regulated by nascent RNA. In endometrial stromal sarcoma， the PRC2 subunit SUZ12 is often fused with the transcription factor JAZF1. How JAZF1-SUZ12 affects PRC2 function and cell differentiation are unknown. Here， we show that JAZF1-SUZ12 disrupts PRC2 recruitment， gene expression and cell differentiation. The loss of the SUZ12 N-terminus in the fusion protein disrupted interaction with JARID2， EPOP and PALI1 and prevented recruitment of PRC2 from RNA to chromatin. JAZF1-SUZ12 occupied PRC2 target genes in undifferentiated cells but relocated to JAZF1 target genes during cell differentiation， altering patterns of H3K27me3 and gene expression and disrupting cell differentiation. We then performed RNA-seq in primary human cells expreesing all proteins， showing that JAZF1-SUZ12 was promoting a specific set of genes upregulated in decidualisation， while blocking immune related genes.  These results reveal the defects in PRC2 function and cell differentiation caused by the JAZF1-SUZ12 fusion protein， which may underlie its role in oncogenesis.,Suz12 GT/GT cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged proteins SUZ12， SUZ12D93， JAZF1-SUZ12 and JAZF1 were differentiated into Embryoid Bodies by removal of LIF and forced aggregation. After differentiation， at days 0，4 and 8 we generated calibrated ChIP-seq data using the FLAG epitope to see the binding profile of all 4 proteins. Additionally， we performed calibrated ChIP-seq at days 0 and 8 of H3K27me3 and H4ac. For assays in human endometrial stromal cells (hEnSC)， cells were transduced with the same FLAG-tagged proteins， and differentiated for 8 days with medroxyprogesterone and 8?-Br-cAMP to generate decidual cells. Total RNA from days 0 and 8 of treatment was used for bulk RNA-seq to establish changes in gene expression,35649353,Cell Rep
Single cell RNA-seq by mostly-natural sequencing by synthesis,GSE197452,Homo sapiens,Massively parallel single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) for diverse applications， from cell atlases to functional screens， is increasingly limited by sequencing costs， and large-scale low-cost sequencing can open many additional applications， including patient diagnostics and drug screens. Here， we adapted and systematically benchmarked a newly developed， mostly-natural sequencing by synthesis method for scRNA-seq. We demonstrate successful application in four scRNA-seq case studies of different technical and biological types， including 5â and 3â scRNA-seq， human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a single individual and in multiplex， as well as Perturb-Seq. Our data show comparable results to existing technology， including compatibility with state of the art scRNA-seq libraries independent of the sequencing technology used â thus providing an enhanced cost-effective path for large scale scRNA-seq.,We generated and analysed single cell RNA-seq (10x Chromium) data for 4 samples. 1) PBMC sample with 3' technology， 2) PBMC sample (same as 1) with 5' single cell technology， 3) a mixture of PBMCs from 8 individuals with  5' technology， and 4) a mixture of 8 Perturb-seq samples (mixed using cell hashing) with 3' technology. For each we sequenced with both Illumina and Ultima sequencing.,36109685,Nat Biotechnol
Enzymatic transfer of acetate on histones from lysine reservoir sites to lysine activating sites (ChIP-Seq),GSE189445,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Histone acetylation， a post-translational modification associated with transcriptional activation， is governed by nuclear acetyl-CoA pools that can vary depending on the metabolic state of the cell. The metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) is proposed to regulate nuclear acetyl-CoA levels， using local acetate to produce acetyl-CoA that is utilized for histone acetylation. We hypothesize that during gene activation， a local transfer of intact acetate occurs between histones to upregulate transcription via sequential action of epigenetic and metabolic enzymes. Here we present converging lines of evidence in support of this acetate transfer to serve rapid gene induction. Using stable isotope labeling， we detect local transfer of intact acetate between histone acetylation sites both in vitro using purified mammalian enzymes and in vivo using quiescence exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a change-of-state model. We delineate the enzymatic components required for this transfer mechanism， finding that ACSS2， histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase enzymes are necessary for efficient acetyl-group transfer in vitro. We show that Acs2， the yeast orthologue of ACSS2， is recruited to the genome during quiescence exit， and observe dynamic changes of histone acetylation in the vicinity of Acs2 peaks in vivo. Strikingly， we find that Acs2 is preferentially associated with the most upregulated growth genes， suggesting that acetyl-group transfer might play an important role in increased gene expression. Overall， our data reveal direct transfer of acetate between histone lysine residues to facilitate rapid transcriptional induction， an exchange that may be critical during metabolic alterations and changes in nutrient availability.,ChIP-seq in a time-course in S. cerevisiae during quiescence exit， measuring four histone acetylation post-translational modifications (H3K9ac， H3K18ac， H3K23ac， and H3K27ac) as well as the enzyme ACSS2; ACSS2 is also measured using TAP-tag in a second strain of yeast. Four time points are measured: glucose-deprived quiescent cells (Q)， 30 min post-quiescence exit (E30)， 240 min post-quiescence exit (E240)， and logarithmic growth (LOG). The replicate structure is as follows: H3K9ac， H3K18ac， H3K23ac， H3K27ac and non-tagged ACSS2 have two replicates each in each time point， with a corresponding two replicates of input in each time point to adjust for sonication efficiency bias; while TAP-tagged ACSS2 has two replicates in Q and E30 and one sample in E240 and LOG， with a corresponding input from this strain with identical replicate structure.,35061542,Sci Adv
Global mRNA half-lives measurement in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay deficient ESCs,GSE153455,Mus musculus,Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway promotes the degradation of several mRNA species， including transcripts containing a premature termination codon. Here，we measured global mRNA half-lives in NMD deficient and wild-type (WT) embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This allowed us to discriminate which transcripts are affected by NMD. Several transcripts had an impaired half-life in Smg5 and Smg6 KO ESCs compared to WT. They belong to different pathways and cellular processing indicating that NMD regulates multiple processes in the cells. Finally， majority of the transcripts had an impairment on the half-life in both Smg5 and Smg6 KO ESCs indicating that endo- and exonucleolityc branches of the NMD pathway target the same mRNAs.,Measurement of global mRNA half-lives in WT and NMD deficient ESCs by SLAM-Seq. We generated stable Smg5 KO and Smg6 KO ESCs. We then measured mRNAs half-lives in Smg5 and Smg6 KO and in WT ESCs.,35241478,Genes Dev
Genome-wide CRISPR screens of T cell exhaustion identify chromatin remodeling factors that limit T cell persistence [Perturb-seq],GSE203592,Mus,T cell exhaustion limits anti-tumor immunity， but the molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood. Using a chronic antigen stimulation assay， we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to systematically discover genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion， which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of several epigenetic regulators， including members of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes， improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo paired CRISPR perturbation and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members， including Arid1a， resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of terminal exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally， Arid1a-depletion limited the global acquisition of chromatin accessibility associated with T cell exhaustion and led to improved anti-tumor immunity after adoptive cell therapy. In summary， we provide a comprehensive atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of the epigenetic state of T cell exhaustion can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.,Perturb-seq samples from mouse T cells sorted from MC-38 tumors.,35750052,Cancer Cell
single cell ATAC-seq,GSE193035,Homo sapiens,The chromatin remodeller ATRX interacts with the histone chaperone DAXX， to deposit the histone variant H3.3 at sites of nucleosome turnover. ATRX is known to bind repetitive， heterochromatic regions of the genome including telomeres， ribosomal DNA and pericentric repeats many of which are putative G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS). At these sites ATRX plays an ancillary role in a wide range of nuclear processes facilitating replication， chromatin modification and transcription.  Here， using an improved protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation， we show that ATRX also binds active regulatory elements in euchromatin. Mutations in ATRX lead to perturbation of gene expression associated with a reduction in chromatin accessibility， histone modification， transcription factor binding and deposition of H3.3 at the sequences to which it normally binds. In erythroid cells where down regulation of a-globin expression is a hallmark of ATR-X syndrome， perturbation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression occurs in only a subset of cells. The stochastic nature of this process suggests that ATRX acts as a general facilitator of cell specific transcriptional and epigenetic programmes， both in heterochromatin and euchromatin.,Individuals with exactly the same mutation in the ATRX gene can have variable degrees of a-thalassaemia. This suggests that a-globin gene expression may not be affected in the majority of erythroid cells in ATR-X syndrome and that the presence of a-thalassaemia may be variable even with the same underlying mutation. To determine if there might be cellular heterogeneity associated with changes in chromatin accessibility we performed single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) on day10 of CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cells differentiation derived from two ATR-X cases with a-thalassaemia and two unaffected donors.,35710802,Nat Commun

Decoding gene regulation in the mouse embryo using single-cell multi-omics,GSE205117,Mus musculus,During embryonic development， transcription-factor mediated remodelling of the epigenome is thought to precede changes in gene expression and prime cells for developmental trajectories. Yet， a comprehensive map of such epigenetic changes is lacking， as are the underlying gene regulatory networks. Here we generate a multi-omics atlas of mouse early organogenesis by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility from tens of thousands of single cells. We develop a computational method to leverage the multi-modal readouts to predict transcription factor binding events in cis-regulatory elements， which we then use to infer gene regulatory networks that underpin lineage commitment events. Finally we show that these in silico transcription factor binding sites and gene regulatory networks can be used to predict the effect of transcription factor perturbation experiments. We demonstrate this by showing that Brachyury is essential for priming neuromesodermal progenitors into somitic mesoderm fate， which we then validate using embryonic Brachyury knockout.,11 samples taken from a time course of mouse embryonic development from E7.5 to E8.75.

Cardiac fibroblasts regulate the development of heart failure via Htra3-TGF-Î²-IGFBP7 axis,GSE168742,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Tissue fibrosis and organ dysfunction are hallmarks of age-related diseases including heart failure， but it remains elusive whether there is a common pathway to induce both events. Through single-cell RNA-seq， spatial transcriptomics， and genetic perturbation， we elucidate that high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) is a critical regulator of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure by maintaining the identity of quiescent cardiac fibroblasts through degrading transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²). Pressure overload downregulates expression of Htra3 in cardiac fibroblasts and activated TGF-Î² signaling， which induces not only cardiac fibrosis but also heart failure through DNA damage accumulation and secretory phenotype induction in failing cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Htra3 in the heart inhibits TGF-Î² signaling and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction after pressure overload. Htra3-regulated induction of spatio-temporal cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte secretory phenotype are observed specifically in infarct regions after myocardial infarction. Integrative analyses of single-cardiomyocyte transcriptome and plasma proteome in human reveal that IGFBP7， which is a cytokine downstream of TGF-Î² and secreted from failing cardiomyocytes， is the most predictable marker of advanced heart failure. These findings highlight the roles of cardiac fibroblasts in regulating cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac fibrosis through the Htra3-TGF-Î²-IGFBP7 pathway， which would be a therapeutic target for heart failure.,Integrative analyses of single-cell RNA-seq of cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes (including cardiac fibroblasts) and spatial transcriptomics during heart failure progression in mouse and human>>>Submitter states that raw data are not available for human samples due to patient privacy concerns<<<,35672400,Nat Commun

Mapping cis-regulatory elements in human excitatory and inhibitory neurons links psychiatric disease heritability and activity-regulated transcriptional programs [ATAC-seq],GSE196854,Homo sapiens,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci associated with psychiatric diseases， yet there is a lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology.

Synergistic function screening of multiple checkpoint perturbation in TIL,GSE202653,Mus musculus,A synergistic function screening system was established， in which a multiplexed CRIPSR knockout library targeting different checkpoint combinations was constructed and transduced into CD8+T cells to block multiple checkpoints in single cell. Based on this system， we performed a in vivo synergistic function screening of several checkpoints in tumor infiltrating CD8+T cells and find the best combined checkpoint blockade strategy to boost the CD8+T cell-mediated tumor elimination in vivo.,In the library designing， a total of 6 checkpoints PDCD1， CTLA4， TIGIT， BTLA， TIM3 and A2AR were selected to make a total of 56 combinations (Table 1). Meanwhile， two distinct biological control groups were created. One group contained 30 combinations covering 5 co-stimulatory molecules for T cell activation， another one contained 15 combinations covering 4 critical molecules in TCR signaling. 6 groups of sgRNA were designed against individual combination. In each combination that contained less than 4 targeting sgRNAs， the non-targeting sgRNAs were included as the patch. At last， a total of 84 non-targeting 4-sgRNA combinations were included as the negative control.,35670669,Nucleic Acids Res
T helper 2-biased transcriptional profile predicts HIV envelope-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells that correlated with reduced risk of infection in RV144 trial,GSE166945,Homo sapiens,Despite the critical role antigen-specific T cells play in containing viral infections， their aggregate frequencies in peripheral blood have not correlated with clinical protection during HIV infection. However， a subset of HIV-specific T cells， which are capable of simultaneously producing multiple effector cytokines， termed polyfunctional T cells， have correlated with delayed disease progression. HIV-specific polyfunctional T cells have been enumerated and characterized using the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay， which allows for simultaneous multiplexed analysis of cytokine expression at the single-cell level. In addition， using an unbiased computational analysis of ICS data generated through the RV144 HIV vaccine case-control study， we identified vaccine-induced HIV envelope (Env)-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells as a novel correlate of reduced risk of HIV infection. However， very little is known about these cells and what differentiates them from other vaccine-elicited T cells.  In addition， the use of sample fixation in the ICS assay prevents those cells from being further interrogated for transcriptional differences.  Thus， we developed a novel live-cell multiplexed cytokine capture assay which allows for identification， sorting and transcriptional profiling of individual antigen-specific polyfunctional T cells by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).  We applied these methods to peripheral blood samples from participants who had received the RV144 vaccine regimen as part of the HVTN 097 clinical trial.  Using this approach， we discovered transcriptional signatures that specifically identify the single-cell Env-specific CD4 T-cell functional profiles which had correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection in RV144.  Interestingly， this signature is particularly characterized by upregulation of Th2 cytokines， supporting the hypothesis that the vaccine-induced Env-specific CD4 T cells likely contributed to the reduced risk of infection by providing T cell help to the Env-specific antibody responses.  By interrogating the gene signatures that correlated with polyfunctionality， we have identified potential mechanisms of how vaccine-elicited polyfunctional T cells may contribute to reduced risk of HIV infection.,â¢ Developed novel ex vivo multiplexed cytokine capture assay to enumerate and sort live polyfunctional T cells for downstream analyses  â¢ Polyfunctional T cells were specifically detected among the vaccine-stimulated T cells  â¢ Sc-RNA sequencing analysis identified novel surface markers enriched among vaccine-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cells  â¢ Identified Th2 transcriptional signature that predicts polyfunctional CD4 T cell profile which correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection in the Rv144 HIV efficacy trial,nan,

Multi-omics gene regulatory network analysis of resting and stimulated PBMCs [stimulation scRNA-seq],GSE178429,Homo sapiens,Cells require coordinated control over gene expression changes when responding to environmental stimuli. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled studies of regulatory dynamics associated with cellular perturbation response in immune cells. However， associating these changes to underlying differences in epigenetic regulation through integration of multi-omic data has not been achieved at single-cell resolution. Here， we apply single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq to assay chromatin accessibility and gene expression in resting and stimulated human blood cells. Collectively， we generate ~91，000 high-coverage single-cell profiles， allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory landscape of immunological response across cell types， stimuli and time. Advancing tools to integrate multiomic data， we connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes， identifying key regulatory hubs associated with immune signaling and stress response. Subsequently， we design FigR - a method to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate TF regulators across single cells. Importantly， construction of a GRN using stimulus response data identifies TF regulatory activity associated withÂ  genetic variants in inflammatory diseases. Lastly， we assess the time-dependent regulatory dynamics of immune stimulation， where we find that cells alter chromatin accessibility prior to productive gene expression， a process occurring at time scales of minutes. Extending this concept of chromatin-mediated priming， and incorporating regulatory relationships defined by FigR， we detect a rare subpopulation of monocytes marked by a primed chromatin state predictive of enhanced immunological response. Overall， we build upon computational tools for GRN construction and demonstrate the utility of GRNs for analysis of multi-omic single cell data.,Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3-4 donors were stimulated with either Interferon gamma， LPS or PMA/ionomycin for 1 hour and 6 hours and then profiled either using the BioRad SureCell single-cell RNA-seq platform.

EZH2 and JARID2 change their binding profiles on RNA and DNA to promote hepatocellular carcinoma [ChIP-seq],GSE133982,Homo sapiens,The molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis have been deeply studied benefit from the highly developing biotechnologies. Here we used high throughput sequencing method to capture the global binding profiles on RNA and DNA of EZH2 and JARID2 in liver normal (THLE-2) and carcinoma (HepG2) cells， respectively. We found that EZH2 and JARID2 showed distinct binding profile in HepG2 and THLE-2 cells. By binding to the primary RNAs， bound transcripts of EZH2 and JARID2 in HepG2 showed significantly increased transcriptional level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. They bound transcripts were also highly related to the HCC development by performing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). By exploring the DNA binding profile， we also detected similar phenomena that EZH2 could increase the transcriptional level of bound genes in HepG2 cells， showing PRC2-independent functions in liver cancer cells. Integrating analysis of the RNA and DNA binding profile showed EZH2 could independent function at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages. In summary， we proposed that the novel regulatory functions of EZH2 and JARID2 that may promote the cancer development in carcinoma liver cells.,We performed ChIP-seq experiment for EZH2， JARID2 and H3K27me3 proteins in THLE-2 cell line， and JARID2 protein in HepG2 cell line.

Genome-wide CRISPR screens of T cell exhaustion identify chromatin remodeling factors that limit T cell persistence [ATAC-seq],GSE203591,Homo sapiens;Mus,T cell exhaustion limits anti-tumor immunity， but the molecular determinants of this process remain poorly understood. Using a chronic antigen stimulation assay， we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to systematically discover genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion， which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. In vivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of several epigenetic regulators， including members of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes， improved T cell persistence in tumors. In vivo paired CRISPR perturbation and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members， including Arid1a， resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of terminal exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Finally， Arid1a-depletion limited the global acquisition of chromatin accessibility associated with T cell exhaustion and led to improved anti-tumor immunity after adoptive cell therapy. In summary， we provide a comprehensive atlas of the genetic regulators of T cell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of the epigenetic state of T cell exhaustion can improve T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy.,ATAC-seq samples from mouse and human T cells with either (1) no genetic perturbation， (2) a single-targeting control sgRNA， or (3) an sgRNA targeting ARID1A.,35750052,Cancer Cell
A single-cell map of dynamic chromatin landscapes ofÂ immuneÂ cells in renal cell carcinoma (scATAC-Seq),GSE181062,Homo sapiens,A complete chart of the chromatin regulatory elements of immune cells in patientsÂ with cancerÂ and their dynamic behavior is necessary to understand the developmentalÂ fatesÂ andÂ toÂ guide therapeutic strategies. Here， we map， at the single-cell level， the chromatin landscape of immune cells from blood， normal adjacent kidney， and malignant tissue from patients withÂ early-stageÂ clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).Â SpecificallyÂ in T cells， we catalogue the various cell states dictated by tissue- and developmental stage-specific chromatin accessibility patterns andÂ weÂ infer key chromatin regulators of these states. In the CD8+Â T cellsÂ progression toÂ dysfunction， we observe an extensive rewiring of the regulatory networks.Â Unexpectedly， we findÂ thatÂ among the transcription factors that orchestrate the path to dysfunction，Â NFkB，Â a transcription factor with an establishedÂ prosurvivalÂ role during TCR-mediated activation，Â is associatedÂ withÂ a proapoptotic program in late stagesÂ of dysfunctionÂ inÂ ccRCCÂ infiltrating CD8+Â T cells.Â Importantly， the epigenomic profilingÂ can stratify RCC patients based on aÂ NFkB-driven proapoptotic signatureÂ which wasÂ alsoÂ validatedÂ at the gene expression and protein level. Our study provides a rich resource for understanding the functional states and regulatory dynamics of immune cells in RCC.Â,We used scATAC-seq to profile the epigenetic landscape of human immune cells from blood， normal adjacent kidney， and malignant tissues from early stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients at baseline. We also performed scRNA-seq for transcriptomic profiling of these sample cells.,35668194,Nat Cancer
Massively parallel phenotyping of coding variants in cancer with Perturb-seq,GSE161824,Homo sapiens,Genome sequencing studies have identified millions of somatic variants in cancer， but it remains challenging to predict the phenotypic impact of most. Experimental approaches to distinguish impactful variants often use phenotypic assays that report on predefined gene-specific functional effects in bulk cell populations. Here， we develop an approach to functionally assess variant impact in single cells by pooled Perturb-seq. We measured the impact of 200 TP53 and KRAS variants on RNA profiles in over 300，000 single lung cancer cells， and used the profiles to categorize variants into phenotypic subsets to distinguish gain-of-function， loss-of-function and dominant negative variants， which we validated by comparison with orthogonal assays. We discovered that KRAS variants did not merely fit into discrete functional categories， but spanned a continuum of gain-of-function phenotypes， and that their functional impact could not have been predicted solely by their frequency in patient cohorts. Our work provides a scalable， gene-agnostic method for coding variant impact phenotyping， with potential applications in multiple disease settings.,To map variant impact， we profiled A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) with 64 channels of 10X Chromium Single Cell 3 RNA-seq v2 (10X Genomics #120237)， expressing a pool of barcoded variant sequences The 64 channels were equally split into two experiments: 32 channels for TP53 variants and 32 channels for KRAS variants. We loaded 7，000 cells per channel for each cDNA library to obtain a total of 224，000 cells per experiment (448，000 cells total across the TP53 and KRAS experiments). For each experiment， paired-end libraries were sequenced over 32 lanes on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 per sequencing parameters recommended by 10X Genomics: cell barcode read length 26 bp， index read length 8 bp and transcript read length 98 bp. No dial-out PCR was done， in contrast to typical Perturb-seq (Dixit et al. 2016; Jaitin et al. 2016; Adamson et al. 2016). Variants were assigned to cells based on reads from the RNA-seq data.Detailed information about the supplementary file formats in this work (raw and processed data) is provided in the supplementary file SCEVIP.README.pdf.,35058622,Nat Biotechnol
IGF2BP2-regulated alternative splicing of NFIC causes excessive granulosa cell proliferation in PCOS [RNA-seq],GSE191022,Homo sapiens,The expression of IGF2BP2 in GCs from PCOS patients was detected using RT-qPCR and western blot. We captured IGF2BP2-interacting transcripts， global transcriptome together with alternative splicing by RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). KGN cells transfected with IGF2BP2 overexpressing plasmids and nuclear factor 1 C-type (NFIC) siRNAs， were applied to CCK-8， EdU and TUNEL assays. IGF2BP2 was highly expressed in GCs from PCOS patients. As a RBP， it preferentially bound to the 3âand 5âUTRs of mRNAs with GGAC motif and a newly found GAAG motif. The overexpression of IGF2BP2 changed the transcriptome profile of KGN cells. IGF2BP2 functioned to regulate alternative splicing events (ASEs) and promote cell proliferation through inhibiting exon skipping events of NFIC. In conclusion， we demonstrated that IGF2BP2 promotes granulosa cell proliferation via regulating alternative splicing of NFIC in PCOS. The findings help to better understand the roles of IGF2BP2 in the pathogenesis of PCOS.,Over-expression of IGF2BP2 in KGN cells.,35293050,Cell Prolif

ARID1B， a molecular suppressor of erythropoiesis， is essential for the  prevention of Mongeâs disease,GSE164351,Homo sapiens,In this work， we used genomic and molecular functional  assays to understand the role of ARID1B in regulating red blood cells under hypoxia using iPS cells derived from non-CMS adapted individuals and comparing the non-CMS wild type cells to non-CMS cells with ARID1B-KD using in-vitro iPSC-derived model system.,hiPSC-derived cell erythroid cells were generated from the adapted non-CMS individuals (referred to as non-CMS) and cell line was created in which ARID1B was knocked down (using shRNA lentivirus) in these non-CMS cells (Referred to as ARID1B-KD).  For ATAC-Seq， transposition reactions were performed on 50，000 non-CMS and non-CMS with ARID1B KD (replicates， n = 3) hiPSC-derived erythroid cells grown under hypoxic and normoxic conditions for two weeks as previously described Buenrostro et al.， 2013 (52).

A TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis modulates PRC2 functions in controlling stem cell bivalency [RNA-seq],GSE182441,Mus musculus,The mammalian Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins regulate the epigenome through catalytic activity (CA)-dependent and -independent functions. While catalytic activity of TETs has been intensely studied as DNA demethylation enzymes， little is known about their CA-independent function in early embryo development. Here we defined the CA-independent function of TET1 in naÃ¯ve-to-formative pluripotent states transition. Using a proteomics method， we mapped the TET1 interactome and identified Paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) as a partner of TET1 for transcriptional repression at the bivalent genes in early development. Genome-wide location analysis revealed that PSPC1-bound regions largely overlap with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits. Functional studies with genetic methods indicated that PSPC1 and TET1 repress， while lncRNA Neat1 activates the bivalent genes during their transcriptional activation. In embryonic stem cell (ESC) state， Neat1 tethers TET1， PSPC1， and PRC2 at promoters. During the ESCs to formative Epiblast like stem cells (EpiLCs) differentiation， PSPC1 and TET1 repress the PRC2 affinity to nascent mRNA transcripts of bivalent genes， while Neat1 facilitates PRC2 binding to those transcripts. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which proteins TET1 and PSPC1， and lncRNA Neat1 dynamically regulate gene transcription by modulating the PRC2 activity in pluripotent states transition.,RNA-seq analysis of Pspc1KO and Neat1KO in ESCs and EpiLCs,35675764,Cell Rep
Bona fide and bystander memory B cell subsets colonize the lung peribronchial niche upon viral infection,GSE174682,Mus musculus,Memory B cells (MBCs) are key cellular components of long-term humoral immunity that dominate recall responses by rapidly differentiating into effector cells. As the biology of MBCs has been mainly studied in the context of model antigen immunizations， the dynamics of these cells during infection remains largely unexplored. Here， we combined influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection models with fluorescent-reporter mice to identify MBCs regardless of antigen-specificity. scRNA-seq analysis and confocal imaging revealed that two main transcriptionally distinct subsets of MBCs colonize the lung airways after infection. These subsets were class-switched， somatically mutated and preferentially differentiated into plasma rather than germinal center cells upon activation. Combined analysis of antigen-specificity and B cell receptor repertoire unveiled a highly permissive selection process that segregated these subsets into âbona fideâ virus-specific MBCs and âbystanderâ MBCs with no apparent specificity for eliciting viruses. Thus， diverse transcriptional programs in MBCs are not linked to specific effector fates but rather to divergent strategies of the immune system to simultaneously provide rapid protection from re-infection while diversifying the initial B cell repertoire.,Memory B cells were FACS-sorted from lungs， mediastinal lymph nodes， or spleen of Aicda-Cre-ERT2 x Rosa26-LSL-eYFP mice 70 days after intranasal infection with influenza A virus PR8 H1N1 strain， and subjected to single-cell RNA-seq by either droplet-based 10x Genomics 5'-end protocol， or plate-based FB5P-seq 5'-end protocol.,35768001,Immunity

Cnot8 Eliminates NaÃ¯ve Regulation Networks and Is Essential for NaÃ¯ve-to-Formative Pluripotency Transition (RNA-Seq),GSE174424,Mus musculus,The transition of mammalian early epiblast at different phases is characterized by the differences of pluripotent states and developmental potential， involving extensive transcriptome changes. However， the role of post-transcriptional RNA degradation modulation in cell fate transition remains largely unexplored. Here， we report that deadenylase Cnot8 of Ccr4-Not complex specifically plays a role in naÃ¯ve-to-formative transition of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Disruption of Cnot8 results in early embryonic lethality， accompanying with the increased expression levels of naÃ¯ve transcription factors in mouse epiblasts. Cnot8 depletion leads to accumulated expression abundances and increased poly(A) tail lengths of massive transcripts including mRNAs of naÃ¯ve regulation networks， impairing the naÃ¯ve-to-formative pluripotency conversion. Mechanistically， Cnot8 interacts with Tob1 and Pabpc1 to guarantee the prompt mRNA deadenylation and degradation of naÃ¯ve regulation networks at specific time. Together， these findings delineate the mechanism underlying PSC fate transition through global degradation of mRNAs for naÃ¯ve regulation networks by Cnot8.,Total 24 RNA-seq libraries with 12 wild type and 12 Cnot8/7 KO from five differential time points,35390160,Nucleic Acids Res
Tuberous sclerosis complex renal lesion pleiotropy arises from multiple aberrant developmental processes,GSE182632,Homo sapiens,Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem tumor-forming disorder caused by loss of TSC1 or TSC2. Renal manifestations predominately include cysts and angiomyolipomas. Despite a well-described monogenic etiology， the cellular pathogenesis has remained elusive. Here， we report a novel genetically-engineered human renal organoid model which recapitulates pleiotropic features of TSC kidney disease in vitro and upon orthotopic xenotransplantation. We find that loss of TSC1/2 affects multiple developmental processes in the renal epithelial， stromal， and glial compartments. First， loss of TSC1/2 leads to an expanded stroma by favouring stromal cell fate acquisition and alters terminal stromal cell identity. Second， epithelial cells in the TSC1/2-/- organoids exhibit a rapamycin-insensitive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Third， a melanocytic population forms exclusively in TSC1/2-/- organoids， branching from MITF+ Schwann cell precursors of a bona fide neural crest-to-Schwann cell differentiation trajectory. Together， these results illustrate the pleiotropic developmental consequences of biallelic inactivation of TSC1/2 and offer insight into the pathogenesis of TSC kidney lesions.,scRNA-seq profiling of WT， TSC1-/-， and TSC2-/- renal organoids at day 9， 13， 17， and 21 of differentiation， from two cell lines (H9 and 168 1d2)， preapred in mixes via MULTI-seq.,35793620,Cell Rep

Neuroblastoma-associated mutations in Drosophila Alk peturb neuronal differentiation and promote neuronal survival.,GSE198850,Drosophila melanogaster,Activating mutations in the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) are found in pediatric neuroblastoma， where they are often associated with poor prognosis. To study the effects of ALK-activating mutations in a genetically controllable system we employed CRIPSR/Cas9 to incorporate orthologues of the oncogenic human driver mutations ALKF1174 and ALKY1278S in the Drosophila Alk locus. AlkF1251 and AlkY1355S mutant Drosophila exhibit phenotypes similar to that previously associated with enhanced Alk signaling. Unexpectedly， both mutant alleles are still dependent on the presence of Jeb ligand for activation， as neither can rescue mutants of the Alk ligand Jeb. However， both Alk mutant third instar brains display hyperplasia， represented by increased numbers of Alk-positive neuronal populations. Despite this hyperplasic phenotype within the central brain area， no brain tumors were observed in mutant animals. Further investigation indicated that larval brain hyperplasia in Alk mutants was not caused by significantly increased rates of proliferation， but rather by decreased levels of apoptosis in the larval brain. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis， we identify maintained neuronal fate change during the temporal fate specification of in the mushroom body lineages， with AlkY1355S mutants displaying precocious aâbâ neuron identity. These findings shed important light on the role of Alk in perturbation of neurodevelopmental processes and highlight the potential of activating Alk mutations to promote survival in neuronal lineages,To investigate the effect of the AlkY1355S mutation from Drosophila melanogaser third instar larval brains of control (w1118) and AlkY1355S alleles using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)， employing 10X genomics.,35972154,Dis Model Mech
Optocoder: computational decoding of spatially indexed bead arrays,GSE193472,Mus musculus;unidentified,Spatial transcriptomics technologies that can quantify gene expression in space are transforming contemporary biology research. Some of such methods use spatially barcoded bead arrays that are optically sequenced by a microscopy setup to detect bead barcodes in space which can be consecutively matched to cell barcodes from the respective single cell sequencing experiment. To have good quality barcodes and a high number of barcode matches in space， robust and efficient computational pipelines are needed to process raw microscopy images and call the bases of bead barcodes accurately. Here， we present Optocoder， a computational pipeline that takes raw optical sequencing microscopy images as input and outputs bead barcodes in space. Optocoder efficiently aligns images， detects beads， and corrects for confounding factors of the fluorescence signal such as crosstalk and phasing before base calling. Furthermore， we implement a machine learning pipeline that is trained using the signal from the beads that match to illumina barcodes in order to predict non-matching bead barcodes which can boost up the number of barcode matches. We benchmark Optocoder using data from an in-house spatial transcriptomics platform as well as data from the Slide-seq method and we show that it can efficiently process both datasets with minimal modification.,4 spatial transcriptomics datasets.

Detect-seq on transfected HEK293T cells [Targeted deep sequencing data],GSE176089,Homo sapiens,We used a new technology， named Detect-seq， to perform genome sequencing on transfected HEK293T cells to see DdCBEs' off-target mutations. Besides， targeted-amplicon sequencing and ATAC-seq data were applied to validate the results of Detect-seq.,We applied DdCBEs to generate on-target editings on mt-DNA to see DdCBEs' editing performance and evaluate their effects on the whole mitochondrial genome. This is the Targeted deep sequencing(Target-seq) part. Target-seq was performed as previously reported. Primers containing the paired Illumina adaptor sequences in the overhangs were designed based on regions flanking the targeting sites (Supplementary table 2). A 10-nt barcode was also added into each primer pairs to reduce the detection limit from 10-1 to 10-5[nm in press]. 10-100 ng of genomic DNA was used for the first round of PCR amplification using NEBNextÂ® Q5UÂ® Hot Start HiFi PCR Master Mix (NEB， M0543L) for approximately 10 cycles. The PCR products were purified with 1Ã Agencourt AMPure XP beads and eluted in nuclease-free water. The second round of amplification was performed on the purified DNA samples with different index primers for about 15 cycles. The PCR products were purified with 0.8Ã Agencourt AMPure XP beads and eluted in nuclease-free water.

A regulatory axis between Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Proteins and Estrogen Receptor alpha modulates the alternative transcriptome of luminal breast cancer,GSE206474,Homo sapiens,The epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (ESRP1/2) control the epithelialâtoâmesenchymal transition (EMT) splicing program in cancer. However， their exact role in Breast Cancer (BC) remains under debate. Here， we report that ESRP1， but not ESRP2， is overexpressed in luminal BCs patients with poor prognosis and correlates with Estrogen Receptor Î± (ERÎ±) mRNA levels. Analysis of ERÎ± genome binding profiles in both cell lines and primary breast tumors showed its binding on both ESRP1 and ESRP2 promoters， and the expression of these genes strongly decreased by ERÎ± silencing in hormone-deprived conditions (apoERÎ±). The combined knock down of ESRP1/2 in MCF-7 cells followed by RNA-Seq， revealed the dysregulation of 754 genes expression， with a widespread alteration of alternative splicing events (ASEs) of genes involved in cell signaling， metabolism， cell growth， and EMT. Functional network analysis of ASEs that correlate with ESRP1/2 expression in ERÎ±+ BCs showed RAC1 as the hub node in the protein-protein interactions altered by ESRP1/2 silencing.The comparison of apoERÎ±- and ESRP-modulated ASEs revealed 63 commonly regulated events， including 27 detected both in primary BCs and endocrine resistant cell lines.Our data support a functional implication of the ERÎ±-ESRP1/2 axis in the onset and progression of BC by controlling the splicing patterns of related genes.,MCF-7 transfected with siCTRL or siRNAs targeting ESRP1 and ESRP2,35887187,Int J Mol Sci
Single cell transcriptome of regional human embryonic stem cell-derived ventral cultures from the spinal cord,GSE186696,Homo sapiens,We generated single RNA-seq data to measure transcriptional profiles of six hESC-derived ventral populations， representing distinct regions of the developing human spinal cord. These cells are differentiated using a protocol that induces collinear activation of region-specific HOX genes during exposure to FGF8 and Wnt signaling (Lippmann et al， 2015 PMID:25843047). By transitioning to media containing retinoic acid， smoothened agonist (SAG)， Purmorphamine (Pur)， and DAPT after varying durations of Wnt signaling， ventral neuronal cultures are generated with unique rostrocaudal identities. In total we recovered the transcriptomes of 12，540 cells. Analysis verified expression of increasingly caudal HOX paralogs that could be correlated to cervical (HOX1-8; H24-vN， H48-vN， and H72-vN)， thoracic (HOX1-9; H120-vN)， lumbar (HOX1-11; H168-vN)， and lumbosacral (HOX1-13; H216-vN) spinal regions. However， inconsistent differentiation between samples resulted in a mix of neural progenitor， neuron， mesodermal， and neural crest derivatives.,The data consist of single RNA-seq measurements taken from hESC-derived cultures that were exposed to CHIR99021 for different amount of time (24-216hr) prior to RA， SAG， Pur， and DAPT treatment.,nan,
Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during early mammalian organogenesis [scNMT_RNA-seq],GSE204902,Mus musculus,Perturbation of DNA methyltransferases and of the active demethylation pathway via TET enzymes results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis， yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from a variety of DNA methylation mutant mouse embryos during mouse early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However， DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases， in particular， a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos. This study therefore provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at whole organism scale， and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.,1824 single cells isolated from TET triple knockout chimeric mouse embryos at E7.5 and E8.5 and processed using either scNMT-seq (Clark et al 2018) or scM&T-seq (Angermueller et al 2016).

Multi-omics gene regulatory network analysis of resting and stimulated PBMCs [scATAC-seq],GSE178428,Homo sapiens,Cells require coordinated control over gene expression changes when responding to environmental stimuli. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled studies of regulatory dynamics associated with cellular perturbation response in immune cells. However， associating these changes to underlying differences in epigenetic regulation through integration of multi-omic data has not been achieved at single-cell resolution. Here， we apply single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq to assay chromatin accessibility and gene expression in resting and stimulated human blood cells. Collectively， we generate ~91，000 high-coverage single-cell profiles， allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory landscape of immunological response across cell types， stimuli and time. Advancing tools to integrate multiomic data， we connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes， identifying key regulatory hubs associated with immune signaling and stress response. Subsequently， we design FigR - a method to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate TF regulators across single cells. Importantly， construction of a GRN using stimulus response data identifies TF regulatory activity associated withÂ  genetic variants in inflammatory diseases. Lastly， we assess the time-dependent regulatory dynamics of immune stimulation， where we find that cells alter chromatin accessibility prior to productive gene expression， a process occurring at time scales of minutes. Extending this concept of chromatin-mediated priming， and incorporating regulatory relationships defined by FigR， we detect a rare subpopulation of monocytes marked by a primed chromatin state predictive of enhanced immunological response. Overall， we build upon computational tools for GRN construction and demonstrate the utility of GRNs for analysis of multi-omic single cell data.,Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3-4 donors were stimulated with either Interferon gamma， LPS or PMA/ionomycin for 1 hour and 6 hours and then profiled using the BioRad SureCell single-cell ATAC-seq platform. Control samples (DMSO) are included for both the 1 hour and 6 hours time points. In addition， the 6 hours stimulations were performed in the presence of a Golgi inhibitor for all 3 stimulants and control.,nan,
Next Generation Sequencing-based Quantitative Analysis of female whole body transcriptomes from w1118 (control) and foxo mutant flies exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 16 hrs,GSE206206,Drosophila melanogaster,Purpose: The goal of this RNA-Seq is to analyze the whole-body transcriptomes from normoxia vs hypoxia exposed flies to identify differentially expressed genes and to identify which differentially gene expression changes require the FOXO transcription factorAbstract from associated manuscript: When exposed to low oxygen or hypoxia， animals must alter their metabolism and physiology to ensure proper cell-， tissue- and whole-body level adaptations to their hypoxic environment. These alterations often involve changes in gene expression. While extensive work has emphasized the importance of the HIF-1 alpha transcription factor on controlling hypoxia gene expression， less is known about other transcriptional mechanisms. We previously identified the transcription factor FOXO as a regulator of hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila larvae and adults. Here we use an RNA sequencing approach to identify FOXO-dependent changes in gene expression that are associated with these tolerance effects. We found that hypoxia altered the expression of over 2000 genes and that approximately 40% of these gene expression changes required FOXO. We discovered that hypoxia exposure led to a FOXO-dependent increase in genes involved in cell signaling， such as kinases， GTPase regulators， and regulators of the Hippo/Yorkie pathway. Among these， we identified homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk) as being required for hypoxia survival. We also found that hypoxia suppresses the expression of genes involved in ribosome synthesis and egg production， and we showed that hypoxia suppresses tRNA synthesis and mRNA translation and reduces female fecundity. Among the downregulated genes， we discovered that FOXO was required for suppression of many ribosomal protein genes and genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation， pointing to a role for FOXO in limiting energetically costly processes such as protein synthesis and mitochondrial activity upon hypoxic stress. This work uncovers a widespread role for FOXO in mediating hypoxia changes in gene expression.Results: RNA Seq differential expression analysis identified a significant (p<0.05，> 1.5 fold expression) change in 2835 transcripts， with 1602 transcripts showing reduced expression levels and 1233 transcripts with elevated expression levels.,For each condition (normoxia vs hypoxia， w111w vs foxo mutant ) there were 3-4 independent biological samples， each consisting of total RNA extracted from 5 adult female flies.,36200850,G3 (Bethesda)

Multimodal single cell sequencing of human diabetic kidney disease implicates chromatin accessibility and genetic background in disease progression [cut-and-run and bulk ATAC-seq to support single cell data],GSE195443,Homo sapiens,Purpose: Identification of glucocorticoid recepor binding sites on human kidney proximal tubular cells to better understand epigenetic alterations  in diabetic kidney diseasesMethods: CUT&RUN assay libraries for cultured cells or human kidneys were generated with the CUTANA kit (EpiCypher， 14-1048). 500，000 cells were mixed and incubated with Concanavalin A (ConA) conjugated paramagnetic beads.

Foxp3-dependent and -independent functions of peripherally-induced regulatory T cells: scRNA-seq,GSE176293,Mus musculus,Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the X-linked lineage-defining transcription factor (TF) Foxp3 are essential for preventing fatal autoimmunity.  During thymic differentiation， Foxp3 expression is induced in a subset of developing self-reactive thymocytes yielding thymic Treg (tTreg) cells， critical for enforcing tolerance to âselfâ.  In the periphery， Foxp3 induction in mature naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells activated under particular conditions results in extrathymic generation of Treg (pTreg) cells， thought to contribute to tolerance against commensal microbiota and dietary antigens. While Foxp3 is indispensable for tTreg cell differentiation and function， its role in pTreg cells has remained unknown. Here， we used complementary genetic approaches to characterize pTreg cells induced by microbial colonization and elucidate a role for Foxp3 in these cells. We found that a pTreg cell-specific gene expression program was installed in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) in a Foxp3-independent manner. In contrast to tTreg cells residing in the secondary lymphoid tissues， colonic microbiota-dependent pTreg cells did not depend on Foxp3 for their fitness or lineage commitment and were capable of preventing colonic effector T cell expansion in a Foxp3-independent manner. Rather， Foxp3 acted in a cell intrinsic manner to limit IL-17 production and was critical for the suppression of rampant intestinal mastocytosis. Thus， in contrast to tTreg cells， whose functionality is entirely Foxp3-dependent， Foxp3 expression plays a notably nuanced role in pTreg cells and acts to fine-tune the activity of IL-17 producing cells with Foxp3-independent regulatory functions.,Germ-free male Foxp3GFP and Foxp3CNS1- mice were colonized with SPF fecal microbiota or kept germ-free. 9 days post-colonization， a 50%-50% mix of GFP+ and GFP- CD4 T cells was sorted from pooled mLN of 3 mice per group and used as input for scRNA-seq analysis.,35700740,Immunity
Dynamics of mRNA fate during light stress and recovery: from transcription to stability and translation,GSE201015,Arabidopsis thaliana,The stability of mRNA is an important determinant of its abundance and， consequently， protein production. There has been extensive research on the pathways governing mRNA stability and translation， however， it is unclear the extent to which these processes are modulated by environmental conditions. We previously modelled rapid recovery gene down-regulation (RRGD) following light stress in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) using mathematical calculations to account for transcription in order to predict half-lives and led to the hypothesis of recovery-specific transcript destabilisation. Here， we test this hypothesis by quantifying changes in transcription， mRNA stability， and translation in leaves of mature Arabidopsis undergoing light stress and recovery and investigate processes regulating transcript abundance and fate. Compared to juvenile plants from prior work， here we find that stability is altered for a range of transcripts that encode proteins involved in post-transcriptional processes in mature leaves. We also observe transcript destabilisation during light stress， followed by re-stabilisation upon recovery. Alongside this， we observe fast transcriptional shut-off in recovery that， when paired with transcript destabilisation， promotes rapid down-regulation of stress-induced genes. Translation was dynamic over the course of light stress and recovery， with substantial transcript-specific increases in polysome loading observed during late stress independently of total mRNA abundance. Taken together， we provide evidence for the combinatorial regulation of transcription， mRNA stability， and translation that occurs during light stress and recovery.,PolyA-enriched RNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) was performed on Arabidopsis leaves infiltrated with cordycepin or mock [buffer only: 1 mM PIPES (pH 6.25)， 1 mM sodium citrate， 1 mM KCl， 15 mM sucrose] harvested at 10， 20， 30， and 40 minutes post-infiltration under unstressed (US， 100 uE)， high-light (HL， 1000 uE)， and recovery conditions (Rec， 1000 ? 100 uE). The transcriptional inhibitor， cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine， Sigma-Aldrich)， was syringe-infiltrated on the abaxial side of fully-expanded leaves (true leaves 4-6) of 21-day old plants. Individual leaves were infiltrated with 0.1 mL of incubation buffer [1 mM PIPES (pH 6.25)， 1 mM sodium citrate， 1 mM KCl， 15 mM sucrose (Seeley et al. 1992)] with 0.6 mM cordycepin， or without (mock)， using a 1 mL needleless syringe (Terumo). Excess liquid was removed from the leaf surface and plants were incubated for a minimum of 10 minutes before further treatment and harvesting. Light-stress was induced by increasing the light intensity to 10Ã growth irradiance (i.e. 1000 ?mol photons m-2 s -1)， resulting in a ?hot high-light? treatment that effectively induces oxidative stress (Jung et al. 2013). For recovery， plants were returned to pre-stress light conditions. Each biological replicate was derived from leaves syringe-infiltrated， with either mock or cordycepin treatment， from the same plant at each time point per condition. Infiltrated leaves were excised， at the appropriate time point under each condition， from the base of the petiole and immediately flash-frozen， in a 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf)， using liquid nitrogen. Changes in polysome- and monosome-bound， and total-mRNAs were also profiled during the course of light stress and recovery. Plants were sampled at 0， 30， and 60 mins of high-light followed by 7.5， 15， and 30 mins of recovery (67.5， 75， 90 mins). Polysome profiling and mRNA-seq was performed in biological triplicate， consisting of multiple whole rosettes (250 mg) from independntly treated plants. Harvested tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 Â°C until ready for processing.[Dec-16-2022] The 'time' information was corrected for GSM6048558-GSM6048627.,37947266,Plant J

Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing reveals singular gene signatures of human ductal cells during adaptation to insulin resistance,GSE207393,Homo sapiens,Adaptation to increased insulin demand is mediated by Î²-cell proliferation and neogenesis among other mechanisms. Although it is known that pancreatic Î²-cells can arise from ductal progenitors， these observations have been limited mostly to the neonatal period. We have recently reported that the duct is a source of insulin secreting cells in adult insulin resistant states. To further explore the signaling pathways underlying the dynamic Î²-cell reserve during insulin resistance we undertook human islet and duct transplantations under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mouse models that were either pregnant， insulin resistant or had insulin resistance superimposed upon pregnancy  (pregnancy+insulin resistance)， followed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on snap-frozen graft samples. We observed an upregulation of proliferation markers (e.g.， NEAT1)， expression of islet endocrine cell markers (e.g.， GCG and PPY) as well as mature Î²-cell markers (e.g.， INS)， in transplanted human duct grafts in response to high insulin demand. We also noted downregulation of ductal cell identity genes (e.g.， KRT19 and ONECUT2) coupled with upregulation of Î²-cell development and insulin signaling pathways. These results indicate that subsets of ductal cells are able to gain Î²-cell identity and reflect a form of compensation during the adaptation to insulin resistance in both physiological and pathological states.,Frozen grafts were transferred to dounce tissue grinder tubes (D8938; Sigma) containing 0.5 ml ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer (NUC-101; Sigma) and homogenized with pestles A and B on ice each for one minute. Samples were transferred to clean 15 ml tubes and homogenizers were rinsed with 1.5 ml buffer followed by 2 ml buffer and transferred to the same 15 ml tubes to get final 4 ml. The tubes were vortexed briefly at moderate speed and set on ice for 5 minutes for cell lysis. To separate nucleus and cytoplasm， the tubes were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 minutes at 4C. Supernatants containing cytoplasmic component were saved for later analysis. Pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in 0.5 ml cold buffer by vortex briefly at moderate speed and 3.5 ml cold buffer was added. Nuclei suspension was mixed by vortex briefly and set on ice for 5 minutes. The tubes were centrifuged at 500x g for 5 minutes， supernatant was saved for later analysis， pellet was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.5 ml PBS containing 0.01% non-acetylated BSA; Sigma and 0.1% RNase inhibitor; 2313A from Clontech). Nuclei suspension was pipetted ten times with a 1 ml tip， filtered through a 30 Î¼m pre-separation filter (130-041-407; Miltenyi biotech)， cell number and cell viability were determined by cell counter using 0.4% trypan blue stain. The average number of total nuclei obtained from one-half graft was approximately 8.5E+5 nuclei (1.7E+6 cells/ml) with 5-10 um size and 93.3 +/- 1.1% dead cell rate (n=32 samples across three independent experiments). Dead nuclei number was adjusted to 1000 nuclei/ul with suspension buffer and 10，000 nuclei were immediately used for generation of Gel Beads in Emulsion (GEMs) and barcoding. Leftover nuclei were saved for later analysis. GEMs were generated using the Chromium 3â Single Cell Library Kit (v2， 10X Genomics， CA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly， 10，000 nuclei were combined with Single Cell Master Mix and encapsulated into the barcoded Gel Beads through the Chromiumâ¢ Controller. After GEM-RT incubation， cDNA samples were recovered， purified and amplified through a cDNA Amplification Reaction. Quality controls on amplified cDNA samples were carried out through using a High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent， CA) on a 2100 BioAnalizer (Agilent， CA) platform. Libraries were then constructed following Fragmentation and Adaptor Ligation and Sample Index incorporation. Finally， purified libraries were run on 2100 BioAnalizer (Agilent， CA) using a High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent， CA) to evaluate the quality of the ~400bp fragments. The final single-cell libraries were sequenced using acoverage of 500，000 pair-ended reads targeted per cell， on a HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina， CA， USA).,35819843,JCI Insight
LGR5 expressing skin fibroblasts define a major hub perturbed in Systemic Sclerosis,GSE195452,Homo sapiens,Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an incurable autoimmune disease with high morbidity and mortality rates， with no effective treatment. Here， we conducted a population scale single-cell genomic analysis of skin and blood samples of 56 healthy controls， and 97 SSc patients at different stages of disease. We found immune compartment activation in only a subset of diffuse SSc patients， but global dysregulation of the stromal compartment， including a novel subset of LGR5+ scleroderma associated fibroblasts (ScAF). ScAF cells are mainly localized in the deep reticular dermis of healthy subjects and are dramatically perturbed morphologically and molecularly in SSc patients. Single-cell multiome profiling of the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of stromal cells in healthy subjects and SSc patients， revealed ScAF-specific markers， pathways， and transcription factors important in disease development. Systematic analysis combining the clinical metadata and molecular features of the patients， associates specific ScAF targets with disease pathogenesis and SSc clinical traits. Our study provides a high-resolution atlas of the entire spectrum of sclerodermatous skin， proposing a paradigm shift in the understanding of SSc disease and facilitating the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for SSc.,Patients who were diagnosed with SSc based on the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism revised criteria for SSc (Van Den Hoogen et al.， 2013)， were recruited to the study from rheumatology departments in two medical centers in Israel.  We excluded SSc patients under biological Disease-Modifying antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). After informed consent (in accordance with Helsinki declaration)， skin samples were obtained through punch biopsy (4 mm)， 10 cm distal to the elbow and placed in saline containing tubes on ice and then transferred to cold FACS buffer (EDTA pH8.0 2mM， BSA 0.5% in PBS). Whole blood samples were collected at the time of skin biopsy， were placed in EDTA-containing tubes (Beckton Dickenson) on ice and diluted 1:1 with ice cold FACS buffer. Skin and blood samples immediately transported to the lab. As a control， we also collected blood and skin samples from healthy patients following the same procedure.,35381199,Cell
Histone chaperone CAF-1 is a synthetic lethal vulnerability in the context of ARID1A deficiencies [ATAC-Seq],GSE125220,Homo sapiens,Mutations in the BAF chromatin remodeling complex rank among the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancers， many of which result in a loss of function of the respective subunits. Recent genomic and chemical screens have revealed synthetic lethal interactions of BAF complex subunits with each other as well as with further chromatin modifiers. Using an epigenome-focused shRNA library， we identified loss of the histone chaperone complex CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) as a synthetic lethal vulnerability of ARID1A-deficient cells that is enhanced by the androgen receptor agonist testosterone. In line with antagonistic roles of the CAF-1 and BAF complexes in nucleosome deposition and remodeling， we show that knock-down of CAF-1 subunits results in a partial reversal of the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility effects caused by loss of ARID1A.

Resolution of the curse of dimensionality in single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis,GSE175525,Homo sapiens,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can determine gene expression in numerous individual cells simultaneously， promoting progress in the biomedical sciences. However， scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional with substantial technical noise， including dropouts. During analysis of scRNA-seq data， such noise engenders a statistical problem known as the curse of dimensionality (COD). Based on high-dimensional statistics， we herein formulate a noise reduction method， RECODE (resolution of the curse of dimensionality)， for high-dimensional data with random sampling noise. We show that RECODE consistently resolves COD in relevant scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers. RECODE does not involve dimension reduction and recovers expression values for all genes， including lowly expressed genes， realizing precise delineation of cell-fate transitions and identification of rare cells with all gene information. Compared to representative imputation methods， RECODE employs different principles and exhibits superior overall performance in cell-clustering， expression-value recovery， and single-cell level analysis. The RECODE algorithm is parameter-free， data-driven， deterministic， and high-speed， and its applicability can be predicted based on the variance normalization performance. We propose RECODE as a powerful strategy for preprocessing noisy high-dimensional data.,Single cell transcriptome analysis of human primodial germ cell like cell (PGCLC) induction process using 10x chromium Single Cell Gene expression system.,35944930,Life Sci Alliance
Investigating tumor radiation response heterogeneity using single-cell sequencing,GSE211617,Homo sapiens,Tumor cellÂ radioresistance is a major challenge in radiotherapy. By contrast， radiation response heterogeneity of tumor cells is poorly understood. Here， we performed scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq of 6 Gy Î³-ray treated human lung adenocarcinoma cells to dissect cellular radiation response heterogeneity from perspective of transcriptional and regulatory cell states. Notably， we observed heterogeneous radioresponsiveness in purified lung adenocarcinoma cells by qualified cellular radiation response based on transcriptional landscape. There was DNA repair and apoptosis related transcriptional cell state appeared post-irradiation. We identified gene markers in this radiation-associated cell state and screened promising targets for LUAD radiosensitization based on 107 transcriptomic data of radiotherapy treated LUAD patients from TCGA database. Besides， transcriptional cell states transition was obvious accompanied with radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in which cell-cell communication was a potential regulatory mechanism. Finally， we identified radiation-associated regulatory cell state and analyzed the regulatory network of key transcriptional factors in cellular radiation response.,scRNA-seq of unpurified and purified A549 cells; scRNA-seq of purified A549 cells (control) and 6 Gy Î³-ray treated purified A549 cells at 2 h (IR_2h) and 6 h (IR_6h) post-irradiation， scATAC-seq of purified A549 cells (control) and 6 Gy Î³-ray treated purified A549 cells at immediate (IR_immediate) and 2 h (IR_2h) post-irradiation.,nan,
Comparison of dual sgRNA library versus Dolcetto by Perturb-seq,GSE205310,Homo sapiens,CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) genetic screens use programmable repression of gene expression to systematically explore questions in cell biology and genetics. However， wider adoption of CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and lack of consensus on the choice of CRISPRi effector proteins. Here， we address these challenges to present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effectors. First， we combine empiric sgRNA selection with a dual sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact， highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next， we rigorously compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an optimal balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal nonspecific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally， we engineer a suite of cell lines which stably express Zim3-dCas9 and demonstrate robust on-target knockdown across these cell lines. Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.,Comparative on-target gene knockdown using scRNA-seq data for K562 cells expressing dCas9-KRAB.

High depth profiling of miRNA targets with chimeric eCLIP [eCLIPseq],GSE198250,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus;Rattus norvegicus,Growing demand in RNA-targeted therapies and promise of miRNA-based drugs creates a need for tools that can accurately identify and quantify miRNA:target interactions at scale. The experimental capture of miRNA:mRNA interactions by ligation into chimeric RNA fragments provides a direct read out of miRNA targets by enabling profiling of miRNA targets with high-throughput sequencing. However， integration of chimeric CLIP-seq into wide practical use has been limited because the inefficiency of the miRNA:mRNA ligation step (resulting in a low rate of chimeric reads in final libraries) combined with the technical complexity of the method makes it challenging to apply to miRNAs of interest at scale. Here we describe chimeric eCLIP， in which we integrate a chimeric ligation step into AGO2 eCLIP to enable chimeric read recovery， and show that removal of the cumbersome polyacrylamide gel and nitrocellulose membrane transfer step common to CLIP techniques can be omitted for chimeric AGO2 eCLIP to create a simplified high throughput version of the assay that maintains high signal-to-noise. With the increased yield of recovered miRNA:mRNA interactions in no-gel chimeric eCLIP， we show that simple enrichment steps using either PCR or on-bead probe capture can be added to chimeric eCLIP in order to target and enrich libraries for chimeric reads specific to one or more miRNAs of interest in both cell lines and tissue samples， resulting in 30- to 175-fold increases in recovery of chimeric reads for miRNAs of interest. We further show that the same probe-capture approach can be used to recover miRNA interactions for a targeted gene of interest， revealing both distinct miRNA targeting as well as co-targeted by several miRNAs from the same seed family. RNA-seq analysis of gene expression following miRNA overexpression confirmed miRNA-mediated repression of chimeric eCLIP identified targets， and indicated that chimeric eCLIP can provide additional sensitivity to detect regulated targets among genes that either contain or lack computationally predicted miRNA target sites. Thus， we believe that chimeric eCLIP will be a useful tool for quantitative profiling of miRNA targets in varied sample types at scale， and revealing a deeper picture for regulatory networks for miRNAs of biological interest.,Chimeric eCLIP performed with gel and without gel in human HEK293T， mouse liver， rat C9 and HEK293T+C9 mix cells.,nan,
Dual genome-wide coding and lncRNA screens in neural induction of induced pluripotent stem cells,GSE150062,Homo sapiens,Human chromosomes are pervasively transcribed， but systematic understanding of coding and lncRNA genome function in cell differentiation is lacking. Using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in human induced pluripotent stem cells， we performed dual genome-wide screens â assessing 18，905 protein-coding and 10，678 lncRNA loci â and identified 419 coding and 201 lncRNA genes that regulate neural induction. Integrative analyses revealed distinct properties of coding and lncRNA genome function， including a 10-fold enrichment of lncRNA genes for roles in differentiation compared to proliferation. Further， we applied Perturb-Seq to obtain granular insights into neural induction phenotypes. While most coding hits stalled or aborted differentiation， lncRNA hits were enriched for the genesis of diverse cellular states， including those outside the neural lineage. In addition to providing a rich resource (danlimlab.shinyapps.io/dualgenomewide) for understanding coding and lncRNA gene function in development， these results indicate that the lncRNA genome regulates lineage commitment in a manner fundamentally distinct from coding genes.,Time-series RNA-Seq， Perturb-Seq， CUT&Tag， and PLAC-Seq.,36381608,Cell Genom

Embryo-scale reverse genetics at single-cell resolution,GSE202639,Danio rerio,The maturation of single cell transcriptomic technologies has facilitated the generation of comprehensive cellular atlases from whole embryos. A majority of this data， however， has been collected from wild type embryos without an appreciation for latent variation present in development. Here we present single cell transcriptomic data from 1812 individually resolved developing zebrafish embryos， encompassing 19 time points， 23 genetic perturbations， and totaling 3.2M cells. The high degree of replication in our study (8 or more embryos per condition) allows us to estimate the variance in cell type abundance organism-wide and to detect perturbation-dependent deviance in cell type composition relative to wild type embryos. Our approach is sensitive to rare cell types， resolving developmental trajectories and genetic dependencies in the cranial ganglia neurons， a cell population that comprises less than 1% of the embryo. Additionally， time-series profiling of individual mutants identified a group of brachyury-independent cells with strikingly similar transcriptomes to notochord sheath cells， leading to new hypotheses about the origins of the skull. We anticipate that standardized collection of high-resolution， organism-scale single cell data from large numbers of individual embryos will enable mapping the genetic dependencies of zebrafish cell types， while also addressing long-standing challenges in developmental genetics， including the cellular and transcriptional plasticity underlying phenotypic diversity across individuals.,Whole zebrafish embryos were collected across multiple timepoints or in response to genetic perturbations with sci-RNA-seq3.Please note that the following processed data files have been updated on Mar 7， 2023:zperturb_full_cell_metadata.csvzperturb_full_gene_metadata.csvzperturb_full_raw_counts.RDS,37968389,Nature

Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during early mammalian organogenesis [10X_Dnmt],GSE204906,Mus musculus,Perturbation of DNA methyltransferases and of the active demethylation pathway via TET enzymes results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis， yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from a variety of DNA methylation mutant mouse embryos during mouse early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However， DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases， in particular， a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos. This study therefore provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at whole organism scale， and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.,18  mouse embryos collected at E8.5 from Dnmt1， Dnmt3a， Dnmt3b homozygous mutants and matching wildtype controls processed using 10x genomics scRNA-seq,36163261,Genome Biol
Nociceptor neurons affect cancer immunosurveillance [RNA-seq 1],GSE205863,Mus musculus,Neuron， melanoma and CD8 co-cultures,Naive splenocyte CD8+ T-cells were FACS-purified from RAMP1wt (CD45.1+) or RAMP1-/- (CD45.2+) mice， cultured and amplified. 8-week-old female RAG1-/- mice were transplanted (i.v.， 2.5x106 cells) with either of RAMP1-/- or RAMP1wt CD8+ T-cells or 1:1 mix of 5x106 RAMP1-/- and RAMP1wt CD8+ T-cells.

Oligodendrocyte differentiation alters tRNA modifications and codon-dependent mRNA decay  [QuantM-seq II],GSE198271,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that confer neuronal myelination. Leukodystrophies associated with oligodendrocyte and hypomyelination are known to result when a number of tRNA metabolism genes are mutated. Thus， for unknown reasons， oligodendrocytes may be hypersensitive to perturbations in tRNA biology. In this study， we survey the tRNA transcriptome in the murine oligodendrocytes cell lineage in an effort to understanding the molecular underpinning for human disease. We find that specific tRNAs are hypomodified in oligodendrocytes within or near the anticodon. This hypomodified state may be the result of differential expression of key modification enzymes during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Moreover， we observe a concomitant relationship between tRNA hypomodification and tRNA decoding potential; observing oligodendrocyte specific alterations in codon optimality-mediated mRNA decay and ribosome transit. Our results reveal that oligodendrocytes naturally maintain a delicate， hypersensitized tRNA/mRNA axis. We suggest this axis underlies disease etiology when further insult to tRNA metabolism is introduced.,tRNA sequencing data (QuantM-seq) of S. cerevisiae WT (2 replicates)， TYW1 deletion (tyw1â) (2 replicates) and WT/tyw1â mixes with ratio 1:3 or 3:1 (2 replicates each),36008413,Nat Commun

Single neonatal perturbations long-lastingly shape the transcriptome and TCR repertoire of the first wave of regulatory T cells,GSE205466,Mus musculus,The first wave of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) generated in neonates has been reported to be indispensable for the life-long prevention of autoimmunity. Although it is widely accepted that neonates are highly susceptible to infections， the impact of neonatal infections on the first wave of Tregs is completely unknown. Here， we challenged newborn Treg fate-mapping mice (Foxp3eGFPCreERT2xRosa26-YFP) with the Toll-like receptor agonists LPS and poly I:C to mimic neonatal bacterial or viral infections， respectively， and subsequently administrated tamoxifen during the first eight days of life to selectively label the first wave of Tregs. Neonatally-tagged Tregs preferentially accumulated in non-lymphoid tissues when compared to lymphoid organs irrespective of the treatment. One week post perturbation， unexpectedly no differences in the frequency and phenotypes of neonatally-tagged Tregs were observed between challenged mice and untreated controls. However， upon aging， a decreased frequency of neonatally-tagged Tregs in both non-lymphoid tissues and lymphoid organs was detected in challenged mice when compared to untreated controls， and became significant twelve weeks post perturbation， with no signs of altered Foxp3 stability. Remarkably， this late decrease in the frequency of neonatally-tagged Tregs only occurred upon perturbations in newborns as challenging of eight-day-old mice did not result in long-lasting alterations of the first wave of Tregs. Combined single-cell T cell receptor (TCR)-seq and RNA-seq revealed that neonatal perturbations drastically diminished TCR diversity and long-lastingly altered the transcriptome of neonatally tagged Tregs， exemplified by lower expression of Tigit， Foxp3， and Il2ra. Together， our data demonstrate that a single， transient encounter with a pathogen in neonates can have long-lasting consequences for the first wave of Tregs， which might affect immunological tolerance， prevention of autoimmunity， and other non-canonical functions of tissue-resident Tregs.,Newborn Foxp3EGFPCreERT2Rosa26YFP mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS， poly I:C， or PBS， followed by three times intragastrical administrations of tamoxifen on days 2， 5， and 8 after birth. Single lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from the spleen， colon， and skin of twelve-week-old PBS-， LPS- or poly I:C neonatally treated mice， and were further stained with TotalSeq-C hashtag antibody (BioLegend) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The same type of organs was labeled by the same TotalSeq Hashtag antibodies， afterward spleen， colon， and skin samples from the same mouse were pooled together for sorting CD8-CD45R-CD11c-CD11b-NK1.1-CD4+YFP+ cells. Sorted cells were then uploaded onto a 10x Chromium Next GEM Chip G using reagents from the Chromium Single Cell 5' Library and Gel Bead Kit (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amplified cDNA was used for both 5' RNA-seq library generation and TCR V(D)J targeted enrichment using the Chromium Single-Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit for Mouse T Cells (10x Genomics). 5' RNA-seq and TCR V(D)J libraries were prepared following the manufacturer's user guide (10x Genomics). Libraries were quantified by QubitTM 3.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher) and quality checked using 2100 Bioanalyzer with High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies). scRNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer to attain approximately 141，381 Â± 63，000 reads per single cell and scTCR V(D)J libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer to obtain approximately 63，987 Â± 6，131 reads per cell.

The combined action of CTCF and its testis-specific paralog BORIS is essential for spermatogenesis,GSE154249,Mus musculus,CTCF is a key organizer of the 3D genome. Its specialized paralog， BORIS， heterodimerizes with CTCF but is expressed only in male germ cells and in cancer states. Unexpectedly， BORIS-null mice have only minimal germ cell defects. To understand the CTCF-BORIS relationship， mouse models with varied CTCF and BORIS levels were generated. Whereas Ctcf+/+Boris+/+， Ctcf+/-Boris+/+， and Ctcf+/+Boris-/- males are fertile， Ctcf+/-Boris-/- (Compound Mutant; CM) males are sterile. Testes with combined depletion of both CTCF and BORIS show reduced size， defective meiotic recombination， increased apoptosis， and malformed spermatozoa. Although CM germ cells exhibit only 25% of CTCF WT expression， chromatin binding of CTCF is preferentially lost from CTCF-BORIS heterodimeric sites. Furthermore， CM testes lose the expression of a large number of spermatogenesis genes and gain the expression of developmentally inappropriate genes that are âtoxicâ to fertility. Thus， a combined action of  CTCF and BORIS is required to both repress pre-meiotic genes and activate post-meiotic genes for a complete spermatogenesis program.,Genome-wide mapping of CTCF and BORISÂ sites and mRNA expression profiles in Ctcf (+/+)Boris(+/+)，  Ctcf (+/-)Boris(+/+)，  Ctcf +/+Boris(-/-)， and Ctcf (+/-)Boris(-/-) [also called 'DKO' or 'CM'] mouse whole testes， round spermatids ， and spermatocytes,34158481,Nat Commun

A TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis modulates PRC2 functions in controlling stem cell bivalency [H3 ChIP-Seq],GSE199266,Mus musculus,The mammalian Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins regulate the epigenome through catalytic activity (CA)-dependent and -independent functions. While catalytic activity of TETs has been intensely studied as DNA demethylation enzymes， little is known about their CA-independent function in early embryo development. Here we defined the CA-independent function of TET1 in naÃ¯ve-to-formative pluripotent states transition. Using a proteomics method， we mapped the TET1 interactome and identified Paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) as a partner of TET1 for transcriptional repression at the bivalent genes in early development. Genome-wide location analysis revealed that PSPC1-bound regions largely overlap with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits. Functional studies with genetic methods indicated that PSPC1 and TET1 repress， while lncRNA Neat1 activates the bivalent genes during their transcriptional activation. In embryonic stem cell (ESC) state， Neat1 tethers TET1， PSPC1， and PRC2 at promoters. During the ESCs to formative Epiblast like stem cells (EpiLCs) differentiation， PSPC1 and TET1 repress the PRC2 affinity to nascent mRNA transcripts of bivalent genes， while Neat1 facilitates PRC2 binding to those transcripts. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which proteins TET1 and PSPC1， and lncRNA Neat1 dynamically regulate gene transcription by modulating the PRC2 activity in pluripotent states transition.,ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in ESCs and EpiLCs,35675764,Cell Rep

Furthermore， we show that RBM45 is absolutely required for proper differentiation in cultured SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells， and that RBM45 regulates splicing of neurodevelopmental target genes central to the activation of gene expression programs that regulate differentiation in vitro.,Transcriptomic profiling of RBM45 binding sites and target genes (CLIP-seq) in control (DMSO-treated) and differentiated (10 ÂµM RA-treated) SH-SY5Y stable cells expressing FLAG-HA-RBM45,36044854,Cell Rep

DUSP6 mediates resistance to JAK2 inhibition and drives leukemic progression (RNA-Seq),GSE190517,Homo sapiens,Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit a propensity for transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML)， for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood， resulting in limited treatment options and dismal clinical outcomes. Here， we performed bulk transcriptome profiling accompanied by single cell RNA-sequencing on CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from serial patient samples obtained at the chronic MPN and sAML phases， identifying aberrantly increased expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) underlying disease transformation. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of DUSP6 led to inhibition of S6 and JAK/STAT signaling， resulting in potent suppression of cell proliferation， while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production in primary samples. Furthermore， ectopic DUSP6 expression augmented proliferation and mediated JAK2 inhibitor resistance， while DUSP6 inhibition reduced colony-forming potential of JAK2 inhibitor-persistent patient cells. Mechanistically， DUSP6 perturbation dampened S6 signaling via inhibition of RSK1， which we identified as a second indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of DUSP6 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models exacerbated disease severity and led to early lethality， whereas DUSP6 knockdown suppressed leukemic engraftment. Finally， pharmacological inhibition of DUSP6 potently and specifically suppressed disease development across Jak2 V617F and MPL W515L MPN mouse models， as well as sAML PDXs， without inducing toxicity in healthy controls.

Dynamic control of metabolic zonation and liver repair by endothelial cell Wnt2 and Wnt9b revealed by single cell spatial transcriptomics using Molecular Cartography,GSE199463,Mus musculus,The conclusive identity of Wnt proteins regulating liver zonation (LZ) and regeneration (LR) remains unclear despite an undisputed role of beta-catenin. Using single-cell analysis of liver cells from various species， a conserved Wnt2 and Wnt9b expression in endothelial cells (ECs) in zone 3 shown to be the major Wnt cell source， was identified. Conditional EC-elimination of Wnt2 and Wnt9b led to perturbation of LZ with not only loss of beta-catenin targets in zone 3， but also re-appearance of zone 1 genes in zone 3， unraveling dynamicity as revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics using Molecular Cartography. Defective LR observed in the knockouts phenocopied other models of defective hepatic Wnt signaling. Administration of a tetravalent antibody to activate Wnt signaling rescued LZ and LR in the knockouts. Molecular Cartography on the livers of the agonist-treated animal revealed changes in LZ. Administration of the agonist also promoted LR in acetaminophen overdose acute liver failure (ALF) fulfilling an unmet clinical need. Overall， we report an unequivocal role of EC-Wnt2 and Wnt9b in LZ and LR and show the role of Wnt activators as regenerative therapy for ALF.,Spatial single-cell gene quantification on three libraries.

Analysis of histone antibody specificity directly in sequencing data using siQ-ChIP,GSE212386,Homo sapiens,We previously developed sans spike-in quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (siQ-ChIP)， a technique that introduces an absolute quantitative scale to ChIP-seq data. The absolute scale is possible because the IP step of ChIP is a competitive binding reaction and produces a classical binding isotherm when antibody or epitope is titrated. The mathematical model that led to siQ-ChIP also predicts that sequencing samples from along an isotherm can reveal differential preferences of the antibody for specific chromatin regions， if the antibody binds with different strengths to different regions. In this paper， we directly test this prediction with several histone post-translational modification (PTM) antibodies. When titrating these antibodies， we identified on- and off-target interactions directly in ChIP-seq. Antibodies that displayed mostly on-target interactions had small， uniform responses for different regions of chromatin， while antibodies that contained off-target interactions had large， variable responses， indicating differences in binding affinity for different chromatin regions. The generation of an isotherm is essential to perform siQ-ChIP analysis. Therefore， we also present a detailed and simplified wet lab protocol， optimized to reproducibly achieve a binding isotherm. We highlight several benchmarks of success that can be used to gain confidence in ChIP experiments， serving as a guide for the practice of siQ-ChIP. Collectively， these studies demonstrate an optimized siQ-ChIP protocol that can be used to determine histone PTM antibody specificity directly in sample chromatin without any exogenous spike-in reagents and at minimal sequencing depth.,HeLa ChIP-Seq,36945621,bioRxiv
Manipulation of  Long-Range Chromatin Interactions through CTCF Phase Separation for Cell Fate Control,GSE147919,Mus musculus,Gene expression is controlled under spatial chromatin structures with short-range in topologically associating domains (TAD) and long-range chromatin interactions between TADs， compartments or chromosomes， and disruption of chromatin structure leads to human diseases. The mechanism of short-range chromatin interactions has been well characterized by loop-extrusion model， but little is known about how long-range chromatin interactions are organized. Here， we demonstrate that CTCF contributes to long-range chromatin interactions via phase separation. Surprisingly， RYBP is required for the phase separation and long-range chromatin organization of CTCF. Artificial CTCF phase seperation restores the long-range chromatin interactions and corresponding gene expression which were eliminated by RYBP depletion， and manipulation of CTCF phase separation also maintains pluripotency and inhibits differentation of embryonic stem cells. These findings support a model that long-range chromatin interactions are organized through phase sepearation of architectural protein， and further reveals the distinct mechanisms of architectural protein in organizing short-range and long-range chromatin interactions.,Examination of  RNA-seq， Hi-C， CTCF HiChIP， RYBP HiCHIP NGS data before or/and after RYBP knock out.,35768498,Cell Res

NOMeseq analysis of Etv2 induced MEF reprogramming,GSE185681,Mus musculus,The vasculature is an essential organ for the delivery of blood and oxygen to all tissues of the body and thus relevant to the treatment of ischemic diseases， injury-induced regeneration， and solid tumor growth. Therefore， the definition of pioneer factors and regulatory pathways that govern the specification and differentiation of endothelial progenitors will serve as a platform for targeted therapies to promote cardiovascular regeneration and treatment of solid organ tumors. Previously， we demonstrated that ETV2 was an essential transcription factor for the development of cardiac， endothelial and hematopoietic lineages.  Here， we report that ETV2 functions as a novel pioneer factor that relaxes closed chromatin and regulates endothelial development. By comparing engineered embryonic stem cell differentiation and reprogramming models with single cell RNA-seq， ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq techniques， we demonstrated that ETV2 was able to bind nucleosomal DNA and function as a pioneer factor independent of the cellular context. We determined that ETV2 executes a pioneering role by recruiting BRG1 to remodel chromatin around endothelial genes and help maintain an open configuration.  ETV2 chromatin binding also resulted in increased H3K27ac deposition.  Collectively， these results will serve as a platform for the development of therapeutic initiatives directed towards cardiovascular and oncological diseases.,NOMe-seq was performed in duplicates using 250，000 cells from control and day 1 reprogrammed MEFs per sample following the protocol described in Lay et al.29 The reagents used in the studies are GpC Methyltransferase (M.CviPI) (NEB # M0227)， Klenow Fragment (3'â5' exo-) (NEB # M0210S)， EZ DNA Methylationâ¢ Kit (VWR # 77001-534)， End-Itâ¢ DNA End-Repair Kit (VWR # 75927-936)， Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (ThermoFisher # K1422)， xGenâ¢ Methyl UDI-UMI Adapters， 1-16 (IDT # 10006644)， xGen Library Amplification Primer Mix (IDT # 1077677)， KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ Kit (Roche # 07959052001). 200-500 bp size gel purified libraries were sequenced with the The NOVASeq S4 flow cell with 150 bp paired end reads.,35550615,Nat Cell Biol

DUSP6 mediates resistance to JAK2 inhibition and drives leukemic progression (microarray),GSE214360,Homo sapiens,Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit a propensity for transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML)， for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood， resulting in limited treatment options and dismal clinical outcomes. Here， we performed bulk transcriptome profiling accompanied by single cell RNA-sequencing on CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from serial patient samples obtained at the chronic MPN and sAML phases， identifying aberrantly increased expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) underlying disease transformation. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of DUSP6 led to inhibition of S6 and JAK/STAT signaling， resulting in potent suppression of cell proliferation， while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production in primary samples. Furthermore， ectopic DUSP6 expression augmented proliferation and mediated JAK2 inhibitor resistance， while DUSP6 inhibition reduced colony-forming potential of JAK2 inhibitor-persistent patient cells. Mechanistically， DUSP6 perturbation dampened S6 signaling via inhibition of RSK1， which we identified as a second indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of DUSP6 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models exacerbated disease severity and led to early lethality， whereas DUSP6 knockdown suppressed leukemic engraftment. Finally， pharmacological inhibition of DUSP6 potently and specifically suppressed disease development across Jak2 V617F and MPL W515L MPN mouse models， as well as sAML PDXs， without inducing toxicity in healthy controls. These findings underscore DUSP6 in driving disease transformation and therapeutic resistance， and highlight the DUSP6-RSK1 axis as a novel， druggable pathway in myeloid malignancies.,Microarray analysis of sorted CD34+ HSPCs from MPN， sAML， and healthy donors,nan,
Community assessment of methods to deconvolve cellular composition from bulk gene expression,GSE199324,Homo sapiens,We generated in vitro and in silico admixtures of tumor， immune， and stromal cells and sequenced them along with the purified populations from which they were derived. We used the admixtures as ground truth in a community-wide DREAM Challenge aimed at providing an objective， unbiased assessment of published deconvolution methods and at promoting development of new approaches. We benchmarked seven published methods and found that they could predict most cell types well， though dissecting functional states of T cells remains difficult: few methods predict memory CD4+ T cells or the memory versus naÃ¯ve compartments of CD8T+ cells and， those that do， show large performance gaps relative to other cell types. We spurred development of 21 novel methods， some of which were able to reliably infer these cellular functional states.,RNA-seq profiling of 11 purified immune cell populations， 2 purified stromal cell populations， 2 cancer cell lines， and in vitro admixtures of these purified populations.,39191725,Nat Commun
Developmental trajectories of thalamic nuclei revealed by single-cell transcriptome profiling and Shh perturbation,GSE211701,Mus musculus,The thalamus is the principal information hub of the vertebrate brain， with essential roles in sensory and motor information processing， attention， and memory. The complex array of thalamic nuclei develops from a restricted pool of neural progenitors. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing and regional abrogation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors， intermediate progenitors， and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these thalamic lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinsonâs disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.,The thalamic primordia were micro-dissected from three embryos per control and SBE1/5 genotype according to anatomical landmarks at four developmental stages (E12.5， E14.5， E16.5， and E18.5) coinciding with peak periods of thalamic proliferation， neurogenesis， and differentiation (n=24 embryos in total).,36476860,Cell Rep
Efficient combinatorial targeting of RNA transcripts in single cells with Cas13 RNA Perturb-seq,GSE213957,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Pooled CRISPR screens coupled with single-cell RNA-sequencing have enabled systematic interrogation of gene function and regulatory networks. Here， we introduce Cas13 RNA Perturb-seq (CaRPool-seq) which leverages the RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas13d system and enables efficient combinatorial perturbations alongside multimodal single-cell profiling. CaRPool-seq encodes multiple perturbations on a cleavable array which is associated with a detectable barcode sequence， allowing for the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes. We compared CaRPool-seq to existing Cas9-based methods， highlighting its unique strength to efficiently profile combinatorially perturbed cells. Finally， we apply CaRPool-seq to perform multiplexed combinatorial perturbations of myeloid differentiation regulators in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model system and identify extensive interactions between different chromatin regulators that can enhance or suppress AML differentiation phenotypes.,We developed CaRPool-seq for efficient combinatorial targeting of multiple targets in single-cells.

A single cell-based computational platform to identify chemical compounds targeting desired sets of transcription factors for cellular conversion [Single-cell RNA-seq],GSE162909,Homo sapiens,Conversion of cellular identity can be achieved safely， without genetic manipulation， by inducing signalling perturbations with chemical compounds to target cell fate-governing transcription factors (TFs). However， chemical-induced cellular conversion currently requires large-scale screening of small compounds， which is time- and labour-intensive. There are no existing computational approaches that facilitate chemical conversion of cell fate. Here， we develop a computational framework (SiPer) to systematically predict chemical compounds specifically targeting desired sets of TFs to direct cellular conversion. This framework integrates a large compendium of chemical perturbation datasets with a network model. We show that SiPer is generally applicable to diverse cellular conversion examples， recapitulating the known chemical compounds and their corresponding protein targets. Furthermore， using chemical compounds predicted by SiPer， we develop a highly efficient protocol for the generation of functional human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps). These results demonstrate that SiPer provides a valuable resource to efficiently identify chemical compounds for cellular conversion.,1 sample of hepatic progenitors were analyzed by single-cell RNA-seq.,nan,

Mapping and understanding the function of RNA in octopus brain,GSE192550,Octopus vulgaris,Coleoid cephalopods possess a highly complex nervous system and a rich behavioral repertoire that is unique within the invertebrates and is comparable to â but evolved independently from â the vertebrates (Shigeno et al. 2018). To explain this complexity， previous studies have implicated a unusually high level of mRNA editing in transcripts expressed in both the octopus and squid nervous system (Albertin et al. 2015; Alon et al. 2015; Liscovitch-Brauer et al. 2017). We have sequenced RNA across 18 tissues from the octopusÂ O. vulgaris， and analyzed the extent of mRNA isoform usage as well as the expression of microRNAs in the nervous system in comparison to non-neuronal tissues.,Messenger RNA and small RNA profiles of 18 tissues of a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris).

RBM45 is an m6A-binding protein that affects neuronal differentiation and the splicing of a subset of pre-mRNAs V,GSE190316,Homo sapiens,Here， we identify RNA-binding motif containing protein 45 (RBM45) as a novel mâ¶A reader， enriched in the brain， and highly expressed during embryonic neurodevelopment. We demonstrate that RBM45 recognizes intronic mâ¶A and that its primary role is as a direct regulator of pre-mRNA splicing for its target genes， many of which are associated with neurodevelopment. Furthermore， we show that RBM45 is absolutely required for proper differentiation in cultured SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells， and that RBM45 regulates splicing of neurodevelopmental target genes central to the activation of gene expression programs that regulate differentiation in vitro.,Gene expression profiling of RBM45 depletion and restoration (ribodepleted-RNA-seq) on basal， undifferentiated (DMSO)， and differentiated (RA) SH-SY5Y stable cell lines,36044854,Cell Rep
Tox reinforces the phenotype and longevity of dysfunctional T cell populations during chronic viral infection [KO vs WT Day 8],GSE132030,Mus musculus,Chronic CD8 T-cell stimulation in persisting infections or tumors can induce a stable gene expression program， known as T-cell dysfunction or exhaustion， that limits the cellâs effector functions and anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity. Thus far， the underlaying molecular mechanisms that induce and stabilize this phenotype are vaguely understood. We report here that establishing this program requires the thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group-box protein (Tox). Genetic disruption of Tox augments effector function， decreases the expression of PD-1， and significantly enhances immunopathology. These changes are linked to a failure in fixing the dysfunctional phenotype in the critical Tcf1+ progenitor population and to impaired epigenetic programing. Surprisingly， the gains in effector function co-incide with declining numbers of Tcf1+ cells and result ultimately in reduced total numbers of pathogen-specific T-cells. Thus， we establish Tox as a critical factor for the development of T-cell dysfunction and establish a clear link between CD8 T-cell intrinsic suppression of effector function and protection against immune-pathology.,2*10^3 wt or ToxâEx5 P14 T-cells were transferred into C57BL6 host， infected with 5x10^6 PFU LCMV-c13 and collected on day 8. P14 T-cells were isolated and FACS-sorted， then lysed for the following RNA extraction using the Agencourt RNAdvance Cell v2 kit (A47942， Beckman Coulter).

Total RNA seq from: A circular RNA expressed from the FAT3 locus regulates neural development,GSE205663,Homo sapiens,Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are key regulators of cellular processes， are abundant in the nervous system， and have putative regulatory roles during neural differentiation. However， the knowledge about circRNA functions in brain development is limited. Here， using RNA-sequencing， we show that circRNA levels increase substantially over the course of differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into rostral and caudal neural progenitor cells (NPCs)， including three of the most abundant circRNAs， ciRS-7， circRMST， and circFAT3. Knockdown of circFAT3 during early neural differentiation resulted in alterations in the expression of genes involved in insulin signaling and resistance. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 30 and 90 days differentiated cerebral organoids deficient in circFAT3 showed a loss of telencephalic radial glial cells and mature cortical neurons， respectively. Furthermore， non-telencephalic NPCs in cerebral organoids showed changes in the expression of genes involved in neural differentiation and migration， including FAT4， ERBB4， UNC5C， and DCC. In vivo depletion of circFat3 in mouse prefrontal cortex using in utero electroporation led to alterations in the positioning of the electroporated cells within the neocortex. Overall， these findings suggest a conserved role for circFAT3 in neural development involving the formation of anterior cell types， neuronal differentiation， and migration.,Total RNA-seq of H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated into neuroepithelial or -mesodermal progenitor cells (NEPs/NMPS) and further into rostral and caudal neural progenitor cells (rNPCs and cNPCs， respectively).

TATTOO-seq delineates spatial and cell type-specific regulatory programs in the developing limb,GSE202326,Mus musculus,The coordinated differentiation of progenitor cells into specialized cell types and their spatial organization into distinct domains is central to embryogenesis. Here， we applied a new unbiased spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics method to identify the genetic programs underlying the emergence of specialized cell types during limb development and their spatial integration. We identify multiple transcription factors whose expression patterns are predominantly associated with cell type specification or spatial position， suggesting two parallel yet highly interconnected regulatory systems. We demonstrate that the embryonic limb undergoes a complex multi-scale re-organization upon perturbation of one of its spatial organizing centers， including the loss of specific cell populations， specific alterations of pre-existing cell statesâ molecular identities and changes in their relative spatial distribution. Our study shows how multi-dimensional single-cell， spatially resolved molecular atlases can allow the deconvolution of spatial identity and cell fate and reveal the interconnected genetic networks that regulate organogenesis and its reorganization upon genetic alterations.,Forelimb cells of the KikGR1 and KikGR1;DEL(PolL-SHFM) mice were sorted into 384-well plates by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed using scRNA-seq (MARS-Seq).,36516250,Sci Adv
High-content CRISPR screens link coronary artery disease genes to endothelial cell programs [Pilot scRNA-seq],GSE212396,Homo sapiens,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of risk loci for common， complex diseases， each of which could point to genes and gene programs that influence disease. For some diseases， it has been observed that GWAS signals converge on a smaller number of biological programs， and that this convergence can help to identify causal genes. However， identifying such convergence remains challenging: each GWAS locus can have 2-20 candidate genes， the cellular programs a gene participates in are difficult to define in an unbiased fashion， and it remains unclear which genes and programs would be likely to influence disease risk. Here， we explored a new approach to address this challenge， by creating an unbiased catalog of gene programs and their regulators in endothelial cells to link variants to functions for coronary artery disease (CAD). To do so， we applied CRISPRi-Perturb-seq to knock down all expressed genes within 500 Kb of all CAD GWAS loci (2，285 genes in total) and measure their effects on the transcriptome using single-cell RNA-seq. We used consensus non-negative matrix factorization to define 60 gene expression programsâincluding core cellular programs， such as ribosome biogenesis， and endothelial cell-specific programs， such as flow response and angiogenesisâand link these programs to upstream regulators including transcription factors， chromatin regulators， metabolic enzymes， and signaling cascades. By combining this gene-to-program catalog with variant-to-gene maps， we find that candidate CAD genes converge onto 6 interrelated gene programs， together involving known and novel genes in 39 of 229 CAD GWAS loci. Analysis of these programs revealed that the cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) complexâwhose potential connection to CAD has not been previously exploredâacts upstream to regulate other CAD genes involved in cytoskeletal organization， extracellular matrix remodeling， and cell migration. The strongest regulator of these programs is TLNRD1， a highly conserved but poorly studied gene that we show acts in the CCM pathway and regulates actin organization and endothelial cell barrier function. Together， our study nominates new genes that likely influence risk for CAD， identifies convergence of CAD risk loci into certain gene programs in endothelial cells， and demonstrates a generalizable strategy to catalog gene programs to connect disease variants to functions.,"This series contains pilot Perturb-seq studies， which were used to optimize conditions for and cross validate the larger Perturb-seq study reported in GSE210681. Human immortalized endothelial cells engineered to contain doxycycline inducible CRISPR interference machinery (CRISPRi TeloHAEC or CRISPRi Eahy926)， were transduced with one of two guide RNA libraries targeting gene promoters (referred to as the 50gene & 200gene libraries)， in a CROP-seq vector. After 5 days of doxycycline treatment， cells were run on a single lane of a 10X Chromium Controller and scRNA-seq libraries generated. For Eahy926， the maximum number of cells recommended in the 10x protocol was used (16k)， or the lane was ""superloaded"" with ~10x more cells (150k). For TeloHAEC， only the superloading condition was used. polyA+ cDNA surrounding the guide sequences was amplified to make ""dialout"" libraries， used to link guide RNA sequences to scRNAseq cell barcodes.",38326615,Nature
Fragment-sequencing unveils local tissue microenvironments at single cell resolution,GSE216189,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The spatial organization of cells within tissues is tightly linked to their biological function.

Application of a New Approach Methodology (NAM)-based Strategy for Genotoxicity Assessment of Data-poor Compounds,GSE213454,Homo sapiens,The conventional battery for genotoxicity testing is not well suited to assessing the large number of chemicals needing evaluation. Traditional in vitro tests lack throughput， provide little mechanistic information， and have poor specificity in predicting in vivo genotoxicity. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) aim to accelerate the pace of hazard assessment and reduce reliance on in vivo tests that are time-consuming and resource-intensive. As such， high-throughput transcriptomic and flow cytometry-based assays have been developed for modernized in vitro genotoxicity assessment. This includes: the TGx-DDI transcriptomic biomarker (i.e.， 64-gene expression signature to identify DNA damage-inducing (DDI) substances)， the MicroFlowÂ® assay (i.e.， a flow cytometry-based micronucleus (MN) test)， and the MultiFlowÂ® assay (i.e.， a multiplexed flow cytometry-based reporter assay that yields mode-of-action (MoA) information). The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of the TGx-DDI transcriptomic biomarker， multiplexed with the MicroFlowÂ® and MultiFlowÂ® assays， as an integrated NAM-based testing strategy for screening data-poor compounds prioritized by Health Canadaâs New Substances Assessment and Control Bureau. Human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells were exposed to 3 control and 10 data-poor substances， using a 6-point concentration range. Gene expression profiling was conducted using the targeted TempO-SeqTM assay， and the TGx-DDI classifier was applied to the dataset. Classifications were compared with those based on the MicroFlowÂ® and MultiFlowÂ® assays. Benchmark Concentration (BMC) modeling was used for potency ranking. The results of the integrated hazard calls indicate that five of the data-poor compounds were genotoxic in vitro， causing DNA damage via a clastogenic MoA， and one via a pan-genotoxic MoA. Two compounds were likely irrelevant positives in the MN test; two are considered possibly genotoxic causing DNA damage via an ambiguous MoA. BMC modeling revealed nearly identical potency rankings for each assay. This ranking was maintained when all endpoint BMCs were converted into a single score using the Toxicological Prioritization (ToxPi) approach. Overall， this study contributes to the establishment of a modernized approach for effective genotoxicity assessment and chemical prioritization for further regulatory scrutiny. We conclude that the integration of TGx-DDI， MicroFlowÂ®， and MultiFlowÂ® endpoints is an effective NAM-based strategy for genotoxicity assessment of data-poor compounds.,A total of 276 samples were sequenced for this toxicogenomics study on 10 data-poor compounds， including technical controls (reference RNA; media only; cells with no treatment).

The association of SYD and BRM to chromatin is dramatically reduced in spt6l and can be Chromatin remodelers have been thought to be crucial in creating an accessible chromatin environment before transcription activation. However， it is still unclear how chromatin remodelers recognize and bind to the active regions.

The association of SYD and BRM to chromatin is dramatically reduced in spt6l and can be restored mainly by SPT6LÎtSH2， which binds to TSS in a RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-independent manner. Furthermore， SPT6L and SYD/BRM are involved in regulating the nucleosome and Pol II occupancy around TSS. The presence of SPT6L is sufficient to restore the association of the chromatin remodeler SYD to chromatin and maintain normal nucleosome occupancy. Our findings suggest that the two chromatin remodelers can form protein complexes with the core subunit of the transcription machinery and regulate nucleosome occupancy in the early transcription stage.,Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for Pol II， SPT6L， SYD， and BRM in Arabidposis.MNase-seq for WT， SPT6L， and SPT6LdetlaSH210-day old seedlings were used for ChIP-seq and Mnase-seq assays.,36453990,Nucleic Acids Res
ONECUT2 regulates RANKL-dependent Enterocyte and Microfold cell differentiation in the small intestine; a multi-omics study [ChIP-Seq],GSE194182,Mus musculus,Microfold (M) cells reside in the intestinal epithelium of Peyerâs patches. Their unique ability to take up and transport antigens from the intestinal lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue is key in the regulation of the gut-associated immune response. Here， we applied a multi-omics approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive M cell differentiation in mouse small intestinal organoids. We generated a comprehensive profile of chromatin accessibility changes and transcription factor dynamics during in vitro M cell differentiation， allowing us to uncover numerous cell type-specific regulatory elements and associated transcription factors. By using single-cell RNA sequencing， we identified an M cell precursor population. We linked precursor-specific gene expression to transcription factor motif content in cis-regulatory elements with our newly developed computational tool SCEPIA， uncovering a high expression of and motif activity for the transcription factor ONECUT2. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo perturbation experiments revealed that ONECUT2 acts downstream of the RANK/RANKL signalling to support Enterocyte differentiation， thereby restricting M cell lineage specification. This study sheds new light on the mechanism regulating mucosal immunity and cell fate balance， and provides a powerful blueprint for investigation of cell fate switches in the intestinal epithelium.,Bulk ChIP-sequencing (H3K27ac， ONECUT2) analysis of mouse small intestinal organoids treated with RANKL for 6 days， or control organoids grown in conventional organoid culture medium.

Their unique ability to take up and transport antigens from the intestinal lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue is key in the regulation of the gut-associated immune response. Here， we applied a multi-omics approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive M cell differentiation in mouse small intestinal organoids. We generated a comprehensive profile of chromatin accessibility changes and transcription factor dynamics during in vitro M cell differentiation， allowing us to uncover numerous cell type-specific regulatory elements and associated transcription factors. By using single-cell RNA sequencing， we identified an M cell precursor population. We linked precursor-specific gene expression to transcription factor motif content in cis-regulatory elements with our newly developed computational tool SCEPIA， uncovering a high expression of and motif activity for the transcription factor ONECUT2. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo perturbation experiments revealed that ONECUT2 acts downstream of the RANK/RANKL signalling to support Enterocyte differentiation， thereby restricting M cell lineage specification. This study sheds new light on the mechanism regulating mucosal immunity and cell fate balance， and provides a powerful blueprint for investigation of cell fate switches in the intestinal epithelium.,scRNA-sequencing analyses of mouse small intestinal organoids treated with RANKL for 9 days (3 x 384-well plates per day) or with RANKL+CSRM617 for 6 days (2 x 384-well plates per day).,36625255,Nucleic Acids Res

Decay of heterochromatin domains at selective gene loci in aging mouse brain cells,GSE187332,Mus musculus,Aging is characterized by a progressive decline of organismal function and increase in vulnerability to diseases. Loss of heterochromatin during aging has been observed in a variety of organisms， however， understanding its role in aging-related phenotypes has been limited by the lack of information about the specific cell types and gene loci affected by this type of epigenetic changes. To address this bottleneck， we probed dynamic changes in chromatin landscape at single cell resolution in the forebrain， hippocampus， heart， skeletal muscle and bone marrows from 3-month， 10-month and 18-month-old mice， and characterized age-associated changes in chromatin accessibility at over 300，000 candidate regulatory elements across 34 major cell types. We report that excitatory neurons displayed profound changes in a specific set of heterochromatin domains during aging， evidenced by an increase in chromatin accessibility， a decrease in the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3， and de-repression of non-coding RNA species. These results suggest that heterochromatin maintenance are impaired in aging excitatory neurons， and this may be associated with increased repetitive element activity and neurodegenerative diseases.,We collected the dorsal hippocampus， frontal cortex， heart， leg muscles and bone marrow from male C57BL/6JN mice in three age groups， namely 3-month， 10-month， and 18-month， and performed single-nucleus ATAC-seq to profile  open chormatin changes during aging. We also performed single-nucleus RNA-seq and paired-tag for H3K9me3 on dorsal hippocampus and frontal cortex.,36207411,Cell Res
A complex regulatory landscape involved in the development of external genitals [4C-seq],GSE138507,Mus musculus,In vertebrates， developmental genes are often controlled by large regulatory landscapes matching the dimensions of topologically associating domains (TADs). In various ontogenic contexts， the associated constitutive chromatin backbone is modified by fine-tuned specific variations in enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-promoter interaction profiles. In this work， we use a TAD flanking the HoxD gene cluster as a paradigm to address the question of how these complex regulatory architectures are formed and how they are de-constructed once their function has been achieved. We suggest that this TAD can be considered as a coherent functional unit in itself， with several regulatory sequences acting together to elicit a transcriptional response. With one notable exception， the deletion of each of these sequences in isolation did not produce any substantial modification in the global transcriptional outcome of the system， a result at odds with a conventional view of long-range enhancer function. Likewise， both the deletion and inversion of a CTCF site located in a region rich in such sequences did not affect transcription of the target gene. In the latter case， however， slight modifications were observed in interaction profiles in vivo in agreement with the loop extrusion model， despite no apparent functional consequences. We discuss these unexpected results by considering both conventional explanations and an alternative possibility whereby a rather unspecific accumulation of particular factors within the TAD backbone may have a global impact upon transcription.,4C-seq analysis of 3D chromatin interactions in different wild type and mutant mouse embryonic tissues,32301703,Elife

H3K18la marks active tissue-specific enhancers [RNA-Seq],GSE195859,Mus musculus,We profiled the genome-wide distribution of H3K18la in samples originating from 6 different in vitro and in vivo mouse samples， representing 3 tissues: embryonic stem cells， macrophages and skeletal muscle as well as in human skeletal muscle and compared them to the profiles of other well-established histone modifications as well as gene expression patterns. Globally， we found that H3K18la profiles resemble H3K27ac profiles better than any other investigated hPTM， including H3K4me3， but that they do not copy them. For all samples， H3K18la marked active CGI promoters of highly expressed genes which were remarkably shared across the different mouse tissues and which contained many housekeeping genes. Promoter H3K18la levels correlated positively to both H3K27ac and H3K4me3 levels as well as to gene expression levels. In addition， we found that H3K18la is enriched at tissue-type specific， active enhancers， which are particularly tissue-type-specific， especially when compared to the H3K18la-marked promoter regions. Accordingly， enhancer H3K18la levels correlate positively to the expression of their nearest genes. Additionally， genes closest to enhancers with high H3K18la levels predominantly consist of tissue-type specific marker genes. Overall， we showed that H3K18la is not only a marker for active promoters， but that it also marks active enhancers， and this both in embryonic tissues and differentiated tissues， and both in mouse and in human.,RNAseq on mouse myoblast and myotube samples was performed to correlate genome-wide H3K18la profile changes to gene expression changes during cell state transitions.

Humanized V(D)J-rearranging and TdT-expressing Mouse Vaccine Models with Physiological HIV-1 Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Precursors,GSE214884,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,"Antibody heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) variable region exons are assembled by V(D)J recombination. V(D)J junctional regions encode complementarity-determining-region 3 (CDR3)， an antigen-contact region immensely diversified through non-templated nucleotide additions (""N-regions"") by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT).  HIV-1 vaccine strategies seek to elicit human HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)， such as the potent CD4-binding site VRC01-class bnAbs.  Mice with primary B cells that express receptors (BCRs) representing bnAb precursors are used as vaccination models. VRC01-class bnAbs uniformly use human HC VH1-2 and commonly use human LCs Vk3-20 or Vk1-33 associated with an exceptionally short 5-amino-acid (5-aa) CDR3.  Prior VRC01-class models had non-physiological precursor levels and/or limited precursor diversity.  Here， we describe VRC01-class rearranging mice that generate more physiological primary VRC01-class BCR repertoires via rearrangement of VH1-2， as well as Vk1-33 and/or Vk3-20 in association with diverse CDR3s.  Human-like TdT expression in mouse precursor B cells increased LC CDR3 length and diversity and also promoted generation of shorter LC CDR3s via N-region suppression of dominant microhomology-mediated Vk-to-Jk joins.  Priming immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer， which strongly engages VRC01 precursors， induced robust VRC01-class germinal center (GC) B cell responses. Vk3-20-based responses were enhanced by N-region addition， which generates Vk3-20-to-Jk junctional sequence combinations that encode VRC01-class 5-aa CDR3s with a critical E residue. VRC01-class-rearranging models should facilitate further evaluation of VRC01-class prime and boost immunogens.  These new VRC01-class mouse models establish a prototype for generation of vaccine-testing mouse models for other HIV-1 bnAb lineages that employ different HC or LC Vs.",HTGTS-rep-seq and HTGTS-SHM-seq,36574685,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

CHD-associated enhancers direct human cardiomyocyte lineage commitment.,GSE190475,Homo sapiens,Enhancers orchestrate gene expression programs that drive multicellular development and lineage commitment. Thus， genetic variants at enhancers are thought to contribute to developmental diseases by altering cell fate commitment. However， while many variant-containing enhancers have been identified， systematic studies to endogenously test the impact of these enhancers on lineage commitment have been lacking. We performed a single-cell CRISPRi screen to directly assess the roles of 25 enhancers and putative cardiac target genes implicated in genetic studies of congenital heart defects (CHD). We identified 16 enhancers whose repression leads to delayed differentiation of human cardiomyocytes. A focused analysis on 6 TBX5 enhancers showed that TBX5 enhancer perturbation delays the transcriptional switch from mid-CM to late-CM states. Knockout of two TBX5 enhancers resulted in X and Y， which phenocopy expected CHD phenotypes. Together， these results identify critical enhancers of cardiac development and suggest that misregulation of these enhancers could contribute to cardiac defects in human patients.,Single cell sequencing of differentiated cardiomyocytes from H9 hESC comprised of three separate conditions.

CAPRIN1 links embryonic stem cell differentiation with RNA metabolism,GSE179002,Mus musculus,Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are self-renewing and pluripotent. In recent years， factors controlling pluripotency， mostly nuclear， have been identified. To reveal non-nuclear regulators of ESCs， we screened an endogenously-labelled fluorescent fusion-protein library in mouse ESCs. One of the more compelling hits was the cell cycle-associated protein， CAPRIN1. CAPRIN1， a Stress Granule (SG) component， exhibited a strikingly cyclical localization pattern in sync with mitosis， and localized to SGs， in response to stress. CAPRIN1 knockout had little effect in ESCs， but dramatically skewed differentiation and gene expression programs. RIP-seq and SLAM-seq revealed that CAPRIN1 associates with， and promotes the degradation of， thousands of RNA transcripts. CAPRIN1 interactome identified XRN2 as the likely ribonuclease. Upon early differentiation or stress， XRN2 colocalizes with CAPRIN1 inside SGs in a CAPRIN1-dependent manner. We propose that CAPRIN1 regulates an RNA degradation pathway operating during early ESC differentiation， eliminating undesired spuriously transcribed transcripts in ESCs.,1.

Mapping of Single Nuclear Transcriptomic Responses Uncovers Plasticity of Subpopulation of Purkinje Neurons Driving Motor Learning,GSE153184,Mus musculus,Cellular diversification is a fundamental feature of the brain that is critical for physiological functions of the nervous system including perception， motor control， and learning and memory. Advances in single cell RNA-sequencing have led to characterization of transcriptomic profiles of distinct major types of neurons in the brain. However， how transcriptomic profiles diversify within a specific population of neurons and their links to function remain poorly understood. Purkinje neurons represent some of the most iconic cells in the brain with decades of research characterizing their anatomy， cell biology， physiology， and roles in plasticity， learning and memory， as well as in diseases of the nervous system. In this study， we deployed an approach of isolating nuclei tagged in specific cell types followed by cell sorting and single nuclear RNA sequencing to profile Purkinje neurons and their response to motor activity and learning in adult mice. We uncovered the molecular map of two major subpopulations of Purkinje neurons， identified by the hallmark genes Aldoc and Plcb4， which bear distinct transcriptomic features. Remarkably， Plcb4+， but not Aldoc+， Purkinje neurons display robust plasticity of gene expression in mice subjected to sensorimotor and learning experience with downregulation of gene clusters related to chromatin regulation and synaptic organization and upregulation of gene clusters related to neuronal activity and synaptic transmission and neuron-immune interactions. Using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetics perturbation approaches， we show that activation of Plcb4+ Purkinje neuron plays a crucial role in associative motor learning. Upon integrating single nuclear RNA-seq datasets with weighted gene network analysis， we also identify a motor activity and learning specific gene module that includes components of the FGFR2-SOS1-MAPK signaling pathway in Plcb4+ Purkinje neurons. Knockout of FGFR2 in Plcb4+ Purkinje neurons in adult mice by a CRISPR approach dramatically disrupts motor learning. Our findings provide a platform for identification of subpopulations of neurons and define how diversification of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum links to their responses to motor learning. Our study， and by extension similar studies in the human brain， will provide the foundation for understanding the selective vulnerability of Plcb4+ Purkinje neurons to neurological diseases.,Exploration the diversification of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum links to their responses to motor learning,35545673,Nature
Tissue-specific interferon-gamma levels drive regulatory T cells to restrain DC1-mediated priming of cytotoxic T cells against lung cancer,GSE216086,Mus musculus,Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are proposed to restrain anti-tumor T cell responses either directly or by suppression of antigen-presenting cells and can act in a tissue-specific manner. Treg abundance is typically reported as a measure of suppression， without consideration of Treg functional quality. Here， we find that Tregs suppress type 1 conventional dendritic cells (DC1) and thereby induce dysfunctional CD8+ T cell responses against lung cancer. This immunoregulatory effect is spatially coordinated within tissue-specific lymph node microniches and requires antigen-specific contact between DC1 and Tregs. Suppressive clonally expanded TH1-like effector Tregs were differentially induced in the lung lymph node in response to tissue-specific levels of interferon-gamma. In cancer patients， TH1-like Tregs but not CD8+/Treg ratios correlate with poor responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Thus， Tregs that adopt the interferon-gamma-dependent TH1-like effector state have increased potential to restrain tumor-reactive T cell responses and represent a critical barrier to productive anti-tumor immunity.,For scRNA-seq of ex vivo-primed T cells， CD8+ OT-I T cells and ZsG+ DC1 sorted from tumor-draining mLN were cultured alone or in the presence of Tregs sorted from tumor-draining mLN (added at the 1:8 Treg:OT-I ratio) as described above. After the 3 day co-culture， cells were collected for sequencing. For scRNA-seq of Tregs， LN were mashed through a 70 Î¼m filter into RPMI (GIBCO)， then incubated with Î±CD16/CD32 (clone 93， BioLegend) in FACS buffer (PBS (GIBCO) with 1% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen)) for 15 min at 4Â°C， washed with FACS buffer and stained with a mix of Î±CD45-APC (1:200， clone 30-F11， Biolegend) and Total-seq A mouse hashtag antibody (1:100， clone 30-F11， Biolegend) in FACS buffer to label individual mice (hashtag labeling was only performed for tdLN， not naÃ¯ve LN). Cells were then washed twice in FACS buffer and tdLN cells from multiple mice were pooled together for subsequent CD4+ T cell enrichment sing the mouse CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec)， following manufacturerâs instructions. Next， cells were stained for FACS and Tregs were sorted as previously described. Cells from ex vivo co-cultures and sorted Tregs were processed for scRNA-seq using the Seq-Well platform with second strand chemistry， as previously described (Gierahn et al.， 2017; Hughes et al.， 2020). Whole transcriptome libraries were barcoded and amplified using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and were sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 (Illumina). Hashtag oligo libraries were amplified as described previously and were sequenced on a Nextseq 550 (Stoeckius et al.， 2018).,36736322,Immunity

Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of cadmium-exposed mouse placentas,GSE206182,Mus musculus,The goal of the study was to identify regions of differential methylation between e18.5 mouse placentas exposed to cadmium and control placentas.,Animal work was approved by the North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee， under protocols 16-045-B and 19-049-B. All mice were on a 14-hour/10-hour light/dark cycle at 30-70 % humidity， 22Â°C Â± 4Â°C. 5-week-old C57Bl/6J (B) female mice were exposed for 5 weeks to 0， 1， or 50 ppm CdCl2 through drinking water (Sigma-Aldrich， 202908).

FGFR3 is a positive regulator of osteoblast expansion and differentiation during zebrafish skull vault development,GSE144944,Danio rerio,In order to study FGFR3âs role in cranial vault development， we generated the first fgfr3 loss-of-function zebrafish (fgfr3lof1/lof1). The mutant fish exhibited major changes in the craniofacial skeleton， with a lack of sutures， abnormal frontal and parietal bones， and the presence of ectopic bones. In order to define cellular and molecular processes responsible for this phenotype， we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of cranial vault cells from fgfr3lof1/lof1 and fgfr3+/+ zebrafish. Our data allow us to define transcriptomic profile of each osteogenic subpopulation involved in cranial vault formation and we revealed a defect in osteoblast differentiation associated with changes in the extracellular matrix. These findings demonstrate that fgfr3 is a positive regulator of osteogenesis and we conclude that changes in the extracellular matrix within growing bone impair cell-cell communication， mineralization， and new osteoblast recruitment.,Using cells isolated from cranial vaults from two fgfr3lof1/lof1 fish and two fgfr3+/+ zebrafish (fgfr3lof/lof: zebrafish line was obtained using CrisPR/Cas9 technology with a stop codon at position 377)， we profiled the transcriptome of nearly 28000 single cells using the Chromium system (10x Genomics). Cells suspensions were obtained using both collagenase digestion and cell sorting to eliminate death cells. Cells of the cranial vault is a mix of several cell types (osteogenic cells， chondrogenic cells， immune cells epidermal cells， endothelial cells). The scRNA-seq libraries were generated with a Chromium Single Cell 3â² Library & Gel Bead Kit v.3 (10x Genomics).

A TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis modulates PRC2 functions in controlling stem cell bivalency [ChIRP-Seq],GSE199265,Mus musculus,The mammalian Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins regulate the epigenome through catalytic activity (CA)-dependent and -independent functions. While catalytic activity of TETs has been intensely studied as DNA demethylation enzymes， little is known about their CA-independent function in early embryo development. Here we defined the CA-independent function of TET1 in naÃ¯ve-to-formative pluripotent states transition. Using a proteomics method， we mapped the TET1 interactome and identified Paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) as a partner of TET1 for transcriptional repression at the bivalent genes in early development. Genome-wide location analysis revealed that PSPC1-bound regions largely overlap with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits. Functional studies with genetic methods indicated that PSPC1 and TET1 repress， while lncRNA Neat1 activates the bivalent genes during their transcriptional activation. In embryonic stem cell (ESC) state， Neat1 tethers TET1， PSPC1， and PRC2 at promoters. During the ESCs to formative Epiblast like stem cells (EpiLCs) differentiation， PSPC1 and TET1 repress the PRC2 affinity to nascent mRNA transcripts of bivalent genes， while Neat1 facilitates PRC2 binding to those transcripts. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which proteins TET1 and PSPC1， and lncRNA Neat1 dynamically regulate gene transcription by modulating the PRC2 activity in pluripotent states transition.,Neat1 ChIRP-seq analysis in WT and Neat1KO ESCs and EpiLCs,35675764,Cell Rep

High-content CRISPR screens link coronary artery disease genes to endothelial cell programs [scRNAseq],GSE210681,Homo sapiens,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of risk loci for common， complex diseases， each of which could point to genes and gene programs that influence disease. For some diseases， it has been observed that GWAS signals converge on a smaller number of biological programs， and that this convergence can help to identify causal genes. However， identifying such convergence remains challenging: each GWAS locus can have 2-20 candidate genes， the cellular programs a gene participates in are difficult to define in an unbiased fashion， and it remains unclear which genes and programs would be likely to influence disease risk. Here， we explored a new approach to address this challenge， by creating an unbiased catalog of gene programs and their regulators in endothelial cells to link variants to functions for coronary artery disease (CAD). To do so， we applied CRISPRi-Perturb-seq to knock down all expressed genes within 500 Kb of all CAD GWAS loci (2，285 genes in total) and measure their effects on the transcriptome using single-cell RNA-seq. We used consensus non-negative matrix factorization to define 60 gene expression programsâincluding core cellular programs， such as ribosome biogenesis， and endothelial cell-specific programs， such as flow response and angiogenesisâand link these programs to upstream regulators including transcription factors， chromatin regulators， metabolic enzymes， and signaling cascades. By combining this gene-to-program catalog with variant-to-gene maps， we find that candidate CAD genes converge onto 6 interrelated gene programs， together involving known and novel genes in 39 of 229 CAD GWAS loci. Analysis of these programs revealed that the cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) complexâwhose potential connection to CAD has not been previously exploredâacts upstream to regulate other CAD genes involved in cytoskeletal organization， extracellular matrix remodeling， and cell migration. The strongest regulator of these programs is TLNRD1， a highly conserved but poorly studied gene that we show acts in the CCM pathway and regulates actin organization and endothelial cell barrier function. Together， our study nominates new genes that likely influence risk for CAD， identifies convergence of CAD risk loci into certain gene programs in endothelial cells， and demonstrates a generalizable strategy to catalog gene programs to connect disease variants to functions.,"Human immortalized endothelial cells engineered to contain doxycycline inducible CRISPR interference machinery (CRISPRi TeloHAEC)， were transduced with a library of 36，880 guide RNAs targeting gene promoters， in a CROP-seq vector. After 5 days of doxycycline treatment， cells were run on 20 lanes of a 10X Chromium Controller and scRNA-seq libraries generated. polyA+ cDNA surrounding the guide sequences was amplified to make ""dialout"" libraries， used to link guide RNA sequences to scRNAseq cell barcodes.",38326615,Nature
Improving gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) by using regulation directionality,GSE208571,Bacillus subtilis,To infer the biological meaning from transcriptome data， it is useful to focus on genes that are regulated by the same regulator， i.e.， regulons. Unfortunately， current gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) tools do not consider whether a gene is activated or repressed by a regulator. This distinction is crucial when analyzing regulons since a regulator can work as an activator of certain genes and as a repressor of other genes， yet both sets of genes belong to the same regulon. Therefore， simply averaging expression differences of the genes of such a regulon will not properly reflect the activity of the regulator. What makes it more complicated is the fact that many genes are regulated by different transcription factors， and current transcriptome analysis tools are unable to indicate which regulator is most likely responsible for the observed expression difference of a gene. To address these challenges， we developed the gene set enrichment analysis program GINtool. Additional features of GINtool are novel graphical representations to facilitate the visualization of gene set analyses of transcriptome data， the possibility to include functional categories as gene sets for analysis， and the option to analyze expression differences within operons， which is useful when analyzing prokaryotic transcriptome and also proteome data.,To illustrate the use of GINtool， we used original RNA-seq data from a B. subtilis strain overexpressing the industrial-relevant xylanase XynA and compared this with RNA-seq data from a strain that does not express XynA. Data have been collected from two independent biological replicates.,38294221,Microbiol Spectr
The Nematode Oscheius tipulae as A Genetic Model for Programmed DNA Elimination [RNA-seq],GSE213885,Oscheius tipulae,Programmed DNA elimination (PDE) is a notable exception to the paradigm of genome integrity. In metazoa， PDE often occurs during early embryogenesis， coincident with germline to somatic cell differentiation. During PDE， portions of genomic DNA are lost， resulting in reduced somatic genomes. Recent studies have described the sequences lost and chromosome behavior in metazoa. However， a system for studying the mechanisms and consequences of PDE in metazoa is lacking. Here， we established a functional and genetic model for PDE in the free-living nematode Oscheius tipulae， a member of the Rhabditidae family， which includes Caenorhabditis elegans. O. tipulae was recently suggested to eliminate DNA. Using staged embryos， we show that O. tipulae PDE occurs during embryogenesis at the 2-16 cell stages， similar to the human/pig parasitic nematode Ascaris. We identified a conserved motif， named Sequence For Elimination (SFE)， for all 12 break sites on the six chromosomes at the junction of retained and eliminated DNA. SFE mutants exhibit a âfail-to-eliminateâ phenotype only at the modified sites. END-seq revealed that breaks can occur at multiple positions within the SFE， with extensive end resection followed by telomere addition to both retained and eliminated ends. We identified through END-seq in the wild-type embryos， genome sequencing of SFE mutants， and comparative genomics of 23 wild isolates a large number of functional SFEs at the chromosome ends. We suggest these alternative SFEs provide flexibility in the sequences eliminated and a fail-safe mechanism for PDE. These studies establish O. tipulae as a new， attractive model to study the mechanisms and consequences of PDE in a metazoan.,RNA-seq from 20 Oscheius tipulae developmental stages including early embryogenesis with staged embryos during and after PDE， as well as samples from gastrulation， morphogenesis， staged larvae (L1 â L4)， dauer， post-dauer larvae， young adults， mature adults and male adults,36379215,Curr Biol

An activity-mediated transition in transcription in early postnatal neurons [ATAC-seq],GSE150533,Mus musculus,The maturation of the mammalian brain occurs after birth， and this stage of neuronal development is frequently impaired in neurological disorders， such as autism and schizophrenia. However， the mechanisms that regulate postnatal brain maturation are poorly defined. By purifying neuronal subpopulations across brain development in mice， we identify a postnatal switch in the transcriptional regulatory circuits that operates in the maturing mammalian brain. We show that this developmental transition includes the formation of hundreds of cell-type-specific neuronal enhancers in the postnatal period that might in part be modulated by neuronal activity. Once selected， these enhancers are active throughout adulthood， suggesting that their formation in early life shapes neuronal identity and regulates mature brain function.,ATAC-seq from mouse neurons,nan,
ONECUT2 regulates RANKL-dependent Enterocyte and Microfold cell differentiation in the small intestine; a multi-omics study [ATAC-seq],GSE194183,Mus musculus,Microfold (M) cells reside in the intestinal epithelium of Peyerâs patches. Their unique ability to take up and transport antigens from the intestinal lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue is key in the regulation of the gut-associated immune response. Here， we applied a multi-omics approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive M cell differentiation in mouse small intestinal organoids. We generated a comprehensive profile of chromatin accessibility changes and transcription factor dynamics during in vitro M cell differentiation， allowing us to uncover numerous cell type-specific regulatory elements and associated transcription factors. By using single-cell RNA sequencing， we identified an M cell precursor population. We linked precursor-specific gene expression to transcription factor motif content in cis-regulatory elements with our newly developed computational tool SCEPIA， uncovering a high expression of and motif activity for the transcription factor ONECUT2. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo perturbation experiments revealed that ONECUT2 acts downstream of the RANK/RANKL signalling to support Enterocyte differentiation， thereby restricting M cell lineage specification. This study sheds new light on the mechanism regulating mucosal immunity and cell fate balance， and provides a powerful blueprint for investigation of cell fate switches in the intestinal epithelium.,Bulk ATAC-sequencing analysis of mouse small intestinal organoids treated with RANKL for 6 days， or control organoids grown in conventional organoid culture medium.

Transcriptome profiling of Entamoeba histolytica in normal and stressed condition.,GSE151975,Entamoeba histolytica,Promoter motifs in Entamoeba histolytica were earlier analysed using microarray data with lower dynamic range of gene expression. Additionally， previous transcriptomic studies did not provide information on the nature of highly transcribed genes， and downstream promoter motifs important for gene expression. To address these issues we generated RNA-Seq data and identified the high and low expressing genes， especially with respect to virulence potential. We analysed sequences both upstream and downstream of start site for important motifs.,We used RNA-Seq data to classify genes according to expression levels， which ranged six orders of magnitude. Data were validated by reporter gene expression. We looked for conserved motifs in sequences upstream and downstream of the initiation codon. Following enrichment by AME we found seven motifs significantly enriched in high expression- and three in low expression-classes. Two of these motifs (M4 and M6) were located downstream of AUG， were exclusively enriched in high expression class. We deleted these motifs to study the regulation of reporter gene expression. We also looked at gene expression changes in cells subjected to growth stress by serum starvation， and experimentally validated the data. (doi: 10.1186/s12864-019-5570-z),30866809,BMC Genomics

Repurposing E3 ubiquitin ligases as cell surface protein degraders using Proteolysis Targeting Antibodies,GSE208372,Mus musculus,The majority of current therapeutics targeting plasma membrane receptors function by antagonizing ligand binding or enzymatic activities. Typical mammalian proteins， however， consist of multiple domains executing discrete but coordinated activities， and saturating inhibition of one functional domain often incompletely suppresses the totality of the proteinâs function. Recent work on targeted protein degradation technologies including Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has highlighted clinically important distinctions between target inhibition and target degradation. However， the generation of heterobifunctional compounds requiring linkage of two small molecules， each with high affinity for their targets， is highly complex， particularly with respect to achieving oral bioavailability. Here we describe the development of Proteolysis Targeting Antibodies (PROTABs) that tether cell-surface E3 ubiquitin ligases to transmembrane proteins， resulting in target ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. PROTAB-mediated degradation drives deeper pathway inhibition than inhibitory antibodies and is functional in vivo. The scope of this technology is also demonstrated through the identification  of additional cell surface E3 ubiquitin ligases that can function as âon demandâ degraders of various cell surface proteins. The generality of this approach enables tissue-selective degradation， as suggested by the Wnt-responsive ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3. Furthermore， through engineering of various optimized antibody formats， we offer insights on the ground rules governing optimal target degradation. Taken together， this work describes a strategy for the rapid development of potent， bioavailable and tissue selective degradation of cell surface proteins.,As a prototypical model of aberrant Wnt signaling， we generated mouse intestinal organoids and used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a frame shift truncation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene， which leads to Wnt pathway hyperactivation and colon cancer initiation.

Systematic functional interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 host factors using Perturb-seq,GSE208240,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,Numerous host factors of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified by screening approaches， but delineating their molecular roles during infection and whether they can be targeted for antiviral intervention remains a challenge. Here we use Perturb-seq， a single-cell CRISPR screening approach， to investigate how CRISPR interference of host factors changes the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response in human lung epithelial cells. Our data reveal two classes of host factors with pronounced phenotypes: factors required for the response to interferon， and factors required for entry or early infection， respectively. Among the latter， we have characterized the NF-ÎºB inhibitor IÎºBÎ± (NFKBIA)， as well as the translation factors EIF4E2 and EIF4H as strong host dependency factors acting early in infection. Overall， our study provides high-throughput functional validation of host factors of SARS-CoV-2 and their roles during viral infection in both infected and uninfected bystander cells.,We inactivated host factors in Calu-3 cells by CRISPR interference(CRISPRi)， infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2， and performed single-cell RNA sequencing 24 hours after infection.,37803001,Nat Commun

Human alveolar progenitors generate dual lineage bronchioalveolar organoids,GSE197949,Homo sapiens,Mechanisms of epithelial renewal in the alveolar compartment remain incompletely understood. To this end， we aimed to characterize alveolar progenitors. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of the HTII-280 positive and  HTII-280+ /EpCAM+populations from total 6 donors from periferal tissue was performed， and analysis revealed subclusters enriched for stem cell signature genes. We found that these alveolar progenitors in organoid culture in vitro show phenotypic lineage plasticity as they can yield alveolar or bronchial cell type progeny. The direction of the differentiation is dependent on the presence of the GSK-3Î² inhibitor， CHIR99021. By RNA-seq analysis of GSK-3 Î²knockdown organoids， we identify additional functional candidate target genes and pathways which contribute to alveolar differentiation independent of Wnt signaling,Human peripheral lung tissue resident HTII-280+ ，  and HTII-280+/Epcam+cells were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Organoid forming and differentiation capacity was tested in different signaling environments， and phenotype was characterized by scRNA-seq， confocal imaging， electron microscopy， qPCR， and immunoblotting. ShGSK3Î²  organoids were generated by lentiviral tansduction of 2 different hairpins against GSK 3Î² and control vector The validity of organoids as an infection model for influenza virus (IAV) was established in comparison to human ex vivo lung tissue.Analysis code is available fromhttps://github.com/bihealth/hoffmann_et_al_bronchioalveolar_organoids>>>Submitter states that raw data are unavailable due to patient privacy concerns<<<,36008580,Commun Biol

Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during early mammalian organogenesis [10X_Tet],GSE204907,Mus musculus,Perturbation of DNA methyltransferases and of the active demethylation pathway via TET enzymes results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis， yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from a variety of DNA methylation mutant mouse embryos during mouse early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However， DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases， in particular， a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos. This study therefore provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at whole organism scale， and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.,8 Samples from E7.5 and E8.5 chimeric mouse embryos.

The CWC27/CWC22 heterodimer: a spliceosome building block linked to the inflammation response in retinal pigment epithelium,GSE145872,Homo sapiens,Human CWC27 is an uncharacterized splicing factor and mutations in its gene are linked to retinal degeneration and other developmental defects. We identify the splicing factor CWC22 as the major CWC27 partner. Both CWC27 and CWC22 are present in published Bact spliceosome structures， but no interacting domains are visible. Here， the structure of a CWC27/CWC22 heterodimer bound to the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) core component eIF4A3 is solved at 3Ã-resolution. According to spliceosomal structures， the EJC is recruited in the C complex， once CWC27 has left. Our 3D structure of the eIF4A3/CWC22/CWC27 complex is compatible with the Bact spliceosome structure but not with that of the C complex， where a CWC27 loop would clash with the EJC core subunit Y14. A CWC27/CWC22 building block might thus form an intermediate landing platform for eIF4A3 onto the Bact complex prior to its conversion into C complex. Knock-down of either CWC27 or CWC22 in immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells affects numerous common genes， indicating that these proteins cooperate， targeting the same pathways. As the most up-regulated genes encode factors involved in inflammation， our findings suggest a possible link to the retinal degeneration associated with CWC27 deficiencies.,9 RNA-seq samples were analyzed. 3 controls samples， 3 samples with siRNA depletion of CWC22 and 3 samples with siRNA depletion of CWC27.,32329775,Nucleic Acids Res

Proteostasis governs differential temperature sensitivity across embryonic cell types,GSE202294,Danio rerio,The genetic program of embryonic development is remarkably robust， but temperature stress can degrade its ability to generate animals with invariant anatomy. While the stereotyped， consistent phenotypes associated with environmental stress during vertebrate development suggest that some cell types are more sensitive to stress than others， the basis of this sensitivity is unknown. Here， we characterize hundreds of individual zebrafish embryos under temperature stress using whole-animal single cell RNA-seq to identify cell types and molecular programs within them that drive phenotypic variability. We find that temperature perturbs the normal proportions and gene expression programs of numerous cell types and also introduces asynchrony in their development. The notochord is particularly sensitive to temperature stress， which we show is due to a specialized cell type， sheath cells. Further analyses show that sheath cells accumulate misfolded protein at elevated temperature， leading to a cascading structural failure of the notochord and irreversible anatomic defects in the embryo. Our study demonstrates that whole-animal single cell RNA-seq can characterize mechanisms important for developmental robustness and pinpoint molecular programs within specific cell types that constitute key failure points.,Whole zebrafish embryos were collected across multiple timepoints or in response to temperature perturbations (28C， 32C， 34C) with sci-RNA-seq3.,37949057,Cell

Clonal multi-omics in DC development,GSE153676,Mus musculus,Despite major developments in single cell multi-omics approaches， a single stem or progenitor cell can only be tested once. Here we develop âclonal multi-omicsâ， where recent daughters of a clone act as surrogates of the parental cell allowing multiple tests of its molecular profile and/or cellular fate under different conditions. We first present SIS-seq â a novel clonal method whereby siblings are examined in parallel for gene expression by RNA-seq， or for fate after culture. We use this method to identify， then validate using CRISPR， the genes expressed in single haematopoietic progenitors that control the development of the different dendritic cell (DC) subtypes. In this way， Bcor is identified as a suppressor of plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC subtype 2 (cDC2) numbers during Flt3 ligand-mediated âemergencyâ DC development. Using a complementary method SIS-skew â where WT and BcorKO siblings of the same clone are examined in parallel for fate â we discover that Bcor restricts clonal expansion， especially for generation of cDC2s， and suppresses clonal fate potential， especially for pDCs. SIS-seq and SIS-skew therefore represent novel and broadly applicable clonal multiomics approaches that can reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing cell function at a single cell level， including after genetic or extrinsic factor perturbation.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual Series,nan,

Yet， each vertebrate species appears to have a unique timing mechanism for forming somites along the vertebral column3-5. Human vertebrate formation remains poorly studied due to technical and ethical limitations. Here we report the generation of self-renewing stem cells with characteristic presomitic mesoderm (PSM) features by reprogramming epithelial cells isolated from human urine. These induced expandable presomitic mesoderm progenitor cells (UiPSM) proliferated extensively for more than 30 passages in chemically defined conditions， robustly producing 1040 UiPSM cells. UiPSM established presomitic mesodermal transcription profile， not detected pluripotency， ectoderm and endoderm related genes. UiPSM developed into presomitic mesodermal lineage cells， such as skeletal muscle cells(skm)， osteoblast and chrondroblast cells in vivo and vitro， when transplanted UiPSM derived human skm cells in muscle injury model， the skm cells can survive in vivo and contribute to muscle regeneration up to one month. Thus， UiPSM is a powerful system to study human somite development and provide strategies for regenerative medicine in musculoskeletal system.,Building library and sequencing process of producing UiPSM,39010176,Cell Biosci

Multi-omic analysis of cell-of-origin and epigenomic state in pediatric H3K27M gliomas,GSE188625,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,It is not known whether midline pediatric gliomas driven by Histone 3 K27M mutations (oncohistones) or EZHIP expression (oncohistone-mimics) share a common cell-of-origin， or arise from distinct cell types with unique vulnerabilities to PRC2 inhibition and partner alterations. Here， we define the etiological and oncogenic relationship between pediatric midline gliomas characterized by inhibition of K27M and K27M-like oncohistones. We assemble an extensive reference for gliogenesis from the developing mouse and human fetal brain. With bulk and single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics， we profiled a large cohort of primary tumors comprising H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M pontine gliomas， H3.3K27M thalamic gliomas， and EZHIP+ posterior fossa ependymomas. We focus on differences across axes of location (thalamus vs. pons vs. posterior fossa)， tumor type (diffuse midline gliomas vs. ependymomas)， and oncohistone (H3.1/2K27M vs. H3.3K27M vs. EZHIP). We use tumor molecular features to delineate transcriptional states and cell-of-origin in each entity. Finally， we use culture models in isogenic contexts to interrogate the effect of each oncohistone or mimic.,8 single-cell RNA-seq samples from healthy mouse forebrains， hindbrain and pons were sequenced at E10.5， E13.5， E16.5 and E18.5.

Loss of function of the mitochondrial peptidase PITRM1 induces Alzheimerâs disease-like pathology and immune perturbations in human cerebral organoids,GSE147047,Homo sapiens,Mutations in pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1)， a mitochondrial protease involved in mitochondrial precursor processing and degradation， result in a slow-progressing syndrome characterized by cerebellar ataxia， psychotic episodes， and obsessive behavior， as well as cognitive decline. To investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms of mitochondrial presequence processing， we employed cortical neurons and cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1 knockout human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). PITRM1 deficiency strongly induced mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and enhanced mitochondrial clearance in iPSC-derived neurons. Furthermore， we observed increased levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid Î² in PITRM1 knockout neurons. However， neither cell death nor protein aggregates were observed in 2D iPSC-derived cortical neuronal cultures. On the other hand， over time， cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1 knockout iPSCs spontaneously developed pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD)， including the accumulation of protein aggregates， tau pathology， and neuronal cell death. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a perturbation of mitochondrial function in all cell types in PITRM1 knockout cerebral organoids， whereas immune transcriptional signatures were substantially dysregulated in astrocytes. Importantly， we provide evidence of a protective role of UPRmt and mitochondrial clearance against impaired mitochondrial presequence processing and proteotoxic stress. Here， we propose a novel concept of PITRM1-linked neurological syndrome whereby defects of mitochondrial presequence processing induce an early activation of UPRmt that， in turn， modulates cytosolic quality control pathways. Thus， our work supports a mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and common neurodegenerative proteinopathies.,4 human cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1-WT and PITRM1-KO iPSCs. For each condition， we prepared single-cell suspensions with a pool of 4 organoids each， all with similar sizes (Day 60).,32632204,Mol Psychiatry

DUSP6 mediates resistance to JAK2 inhibition and drives leukemic progression (single-cell RNA-seq),GSE214914,Homo sapiens,Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) exhibit a propensity for transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML)， for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood， resulting in limited treatment options and dismal clinical outcomes. Here， we performed bulk transcriptome profiling accompanied by single cell RNA-sequencing on CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from serial patient samples obtained at the chronic MPN and sAML phases， identifying aberrantly increased expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) underlying disease transformation. Genetic and pharmacologic targeting of DUSP6 led to inhibition of S6 and JAK/STAT signaling， resulting in potent suppression of cell proliferation， while also reducing inflammatory cytokine production in primary samples. Furthermore， ectopic DUSP6 expression augmented proliferation and mediated JAK2 inhibitor resistance， while DUSP6 inhibition reduced colony-forming potential of JAK2 inhibitor-persistent patient cells. Mechanistically， DUSP6 perturbation dampened S6 signaling via inhibition of RSK1， which we identified as a second indispensable candidate associated with poor clinical outcome. Ectopic expression of DUSP6 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models exacerbated disease severity and led to early lethality， whereas DUSP6 knockdown suppressed leukemic engraftment. Finally， pharmacological inhibition of DUSP6 potently and specifically suppressed disease development across Jak2 V617F and MPL W515L MPN mouse models， as well as sAML PDXs， without inducing toxicity in healthy controls. These findings underscore DUSP6 in driving disease transformation and therapeutic resistance， and highlight the DUSP6-RSK1 axis as a novel， druggable pathway in myeloid malignancies.,Single cell RNA-sequencing of serial MPN and sAML samples from patients， and healthy donor control,36787509,Blood
DNA dioxygenases Tet2/3 control epithelial differentiation [ATAC-seq],GSE214169,Mus musculus,Execution of lineage-specific differentiation programs requires tight coordination between many regulators including Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes catalyzing 5-methylcytosine oxidation in DNA. Here， by using Keratin 14-Cre-driven ablation of Tet genes in skin epithelial cells， we demonstrate that ablation of Tet2/Tet3 result in marked alterations of hair shape and length followed by hair loss. We show that through DNA demethylation， Tet2/Tet3 control chromatin accessibility， Dlx3 binding and promoter activity of the Krt25 and Krt28 genes regulating hair shape， as well as regulate interactions between the Krt28 gene promoter and distal enhancer. Moreover， Tet2/Tet3 also control three-dimensional chromatin topology in Keratin type I/II gene loci via DNA methylation-independent mechanisms. These data demonstrate the essential roles for Tet2/3 in establishment of lineage-specific gene expression program and control of Dlx3/Krt25/Krt28 axis in hair follicle epithelial cells and implicate modulation of DNA methylation as a novel approach for hair growth control.We performed ATAC-seq from sorted hair matrix keratinocytes of wild type and TetDKO (Krt14-Cre， Tet2 flox/flox， Tet3 flox/flox) mice at P4.5 which are treated or untreated with 5-aza.,ATAC-seq kit (active motif， #81286) is purchased from active motif company.

Enteric glial cells favor accumulation of anti-inflammatory macrophages during the resolution of muscularis inflammation,GSE167464,Mus musculus,Monocyte-derived macrophages (MÏs) are crucial regulators during muscularis inflammation. However， it is unclear which micro-environmental factors are responsible for monocyte recruitment and anti-inflammatory MÏ differentiation in this paradigm. Here， we investigate MÏ heterogeneity at different stages of muscularis inflammation and determine how environmental cues can attract and activate tissue-protective MÏs. Results showed that muscularis inflammation induced marked alterations in mononuclear phagocyte populations associated with a rapid infiltration of Ly6c+ monocytes that locally acquired unique transcriptional states. Trajectory inference analysis revealed two main pro-resolving MÏ subpopulations during the resolution of muscularis inflammation， i.e. Cd206+ MhcIIhi and Timp2+ MhcIIlo MÏs. Interestingly， we found that damage to the micro-environment upon muscularis inflammation resulted in EGC activation， which in turn stimulated monocyte infiltration and the consequent differentiation in anti-inflammatory CD206+ MÏs via CCL2 and CSF1， respectively. In addition， CSF1-CSF1R signaling was shown to be essential for the differentiation of monocytes into CD206+ MÏs and EGC proliferation during muscularis inflammation. Our study provides a comprehensive insight into pro-resolving MÏ differentiation and their regulators during muscularis inflammation. We deepened our understanding in the interaction between EGCs and MÏs， thereby highlighting pro-resolving MÏ differentiation as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of intestinal inflammation.,To induce gene recombination of Rpl22HA in PLP1CreERT2 Rpl22HA transgenic mice at 10-12 weeks of age were injected twice intraperitoneally with 100 Âµl of 15 mg/ml tamoxifen (Sigma) dissolved in Miglyol 812 (Caesar & Loretz， Hilden， Germany). All animals were sacrificed 3-4 weeks after the first injection. The whole small intestine of each mouse was peeled by removing the mucosa and submucosa in order to obtain preparations of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layer and adherent myenteric plexus. Next， samples were flash frozen until processing.Immunoprecipitated samples were processed and analyzed according to published protocols4， 5. In brief， mRNA was captured with Dynabeads oligo(dT) (Life Technologies) according to manufacturerâs guidelines. A bulk variation of MARSseq6 was used to prepare libraries for RNA-seq. RNA was reversed transcribed with MARSseq barcoded RT primer in a 10 mL volume with the Affinity Script kit (Agilent). Reverse transcription was analyzed by qRT-PCR and samples with a similar CT were pooled (up to eight samples per pool). Each pool was treated with Exonuclease I (NEB) for 30 min at 37Â°C and subsequently cleaned by 1.2 x volumes of SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter). Subsequently， the cDNA was converted to double-stranded DNA with a second strand synthesis kit (NEB) in a 20mL reaction， incubating for 2 h at 16Â°C. The product was purified with 1.4 x volumes of SPRI beads， eluted in 8 mL and in vitro transcribed (with the beads) at 37Â°C overnight for linear amplification using the T7 High Yield RNA polymerase IVT kit (NEB). Following IVT， the DNA template was removed with Turbo DNase I (Ambion) 15 min at 37Â°C and the amplified RNA (aRNA) purified with 1.2 volumes of SPRI beads. The aRNA was fragmented by incubating 3 min at 70Â°C in Zn2+ RNA fragmentation reagents (Ambion) and purified with 2 x volumes of SPRI beads. The aRNA was ligated to the MARS-seq ligation adaptor with T4 RNA Ligase I (NEB). The reaction was incubated at 22Â°C for 2 h. After 1.5 x SPRI cleanup， the ligated product was reverse transcribed using Affinity Script RT enzyme (Agilent) and a primer complementary to the ligated adaptor. The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 42Â°C， 45 min at 50Â°C， and 5 min at 85Â°C. The cDNA was purified with 1.5 x volumes of SPRI beads. The library was completed and amplified through a nested PCR reaction with 0.5mM of P5_Rd1 and P7_Rd2 primers and PCR ready mix (Kappa Biosystems). The amplified pooled library was purified with 0.7 x volumes of SPRI beads to remove primer leftovers. Library concentration was measured with a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies) and mean molecule size was determined with a 2200 TapeStation instrument.RNaseq libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 2000.Data analysis was performed by using the UTAP transcriptome analysis pipeline (Kohen et al.， 2019). Raw reads were trimmed using cutadapt with the parameters: -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC -a âAâtimes 2 -u 3 -u â3 -q 20 -m 25). Reads were mapped to the genome (mm10， Gencode annotation version 10.0) using STAR (v2.4.2a) with the parameters âalignEndsType EndToEnd， âoutFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05， âtwopassMode Basic， âalignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No. The pipeline quantifies the 3â² of Gencode annotated genes (The 3â² region contains 1，000 bases upstream of the 3â² end and 100 bases downstream). UMI counting was done after marking duplicates (in-house script) using HTSeq-count in union mode. Only reads with unique mapping were considered for further analysis， and genes having minimum 5 reads in at least one sample were considered. Gene expression levels were calculated and normalized using DESeq2 (1.26.0),36071145,Mucosal Immunol

Next generation sequencing of miR6024 overexpressing tomato transgenics in control state and under Alternaria solani stress,GSE166013,Solanum lycopersicum,miR6024 overexpression may lead to changes in the transcriptome profile of tomato plants. Further changes may be noticed on infecting these plants with the necrotrophic pathogen Alternaria solani. These changes can only be gauged by carrying out a comparative transcriptome analysis with the wild type plants under similar conditions. We have used tomato (Pusa Ruby) for generation of miR6024 overexpressing transgenics. Disease study on these plants were carried out with the necrotrophic fungus A. solani. We carried an RNA-seq analysis using Illumina hiseq sequencing of 5 RNA libraries created from leaf tissues of wild type， OVX6024  transgenics and A. solani infected wild type and OVX6024 plants. The analysis revealed that 334 and 781 genes were significantly regulated in the transgenic plants and the infected transgenic plants respectively， with respect to their suitable  wild type controls. GO enrichment analysis and pathway analysis have been carried out as well.

Wnt/PCP-primed intestinal stem cells directly differentiate into enteroendocrine or Paneth cells,GSE152325,Mus musculus,We performed 7 single-cell RNAseq experiments to identify progenitor cell populations in the small intestine. To also capture rare intestinal cell populations such as stem cells and secretory cells we not only analyzed crypt cells from wildtype mice but also used two reporter mouse lines: i) the FltpZV/+ mouse line of which we mixed live crypt cells with Fltp Venus reporter (FVR) positive cells at different ratios and ii) Foxa2-Venus fusion (FVF) reporter mice. The FVF-enriched samples are part of another manuscript (link to GEO# will be provided). Using this FACS-based enrichment strategy， we could identify a Paneth cell-primed ISC population and potential progenitor populations for all intestinal lineages. To assess the role of Wnt/PCP signaling for enteroendocrine and Paneth cell differentiation， we performed 4 single-cell RNAseq experiments from crypt cells of Celsr1crsh/+; FltpZV/ZV compound mutant mice. When comparing control and mutant cells we found specific transcriptional alterations in the Paneth cell lineage.,7 single-cell RNA-seq experiments were performed using 10X Genomics technology to generate  single cell transcriptomic profiles of small intestinal epithelial crypt cells from control wildtype and FltpZV/+ mouse line. 4 samples single-cell RNA-seq experiments were performed using 10X Genomics technology to generate  single cell transcriptomic profiles of small intestinal epithelial crypt cells  from a Flattop (Fltp)-Venus-Reporter (FVR) Celsr1(crsh) hemizygous mouse line.

Transcriptome characterization of organoids derived from healthy and irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver,GSE180882,Homo sapiens,Background and Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will soon become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the US and is  also associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Currently， there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH， we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology.  Approach and Results: We devised methods allowing derivation， proliferation， hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver. The transcriptomes of organoids derived from NASH liver， but not healthy liver show significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory and cytochrome p450-related pathways， as well as of known liver fibrosis and tumor markers， with the degree of upregulation being NASH patient-specific.,Hepatically differentiated organoids from 3 healthy livers (FDD，FLD，MLD) and 8 diseased livers (NASH1-6， AC and CF) were subjected to RNA seq. In addition liver samples correponding to NASH5 and NASH6 organoids were also squenced,nan,

Global early replication disrupts gene expression and chromatin conformation in a single cell cycle: replication timing,GSE199447,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,The early embryonic divisions of many organisms， including fish， flies and frogs are characterised by a very rapid S-phase caused by high rates of replication initiation. In somatic cells， S-phase is much longer due to both a reduction in the total number of initiation events and the imposition of a temporal order of origin activation. The physiological importance of changes in the rate and timing of replication initiation in S-phase remains unclear. Here we assess the importance of the temporal control of replication initiation using a conditional system in budding yeast to drive the early replication of all origins in a single cell cycle. We show that global early replication disrupts the expression of over a quarter of all genes. By deleting individual origins we show that delaying replication is sufficient to restore normal gene expression， directly establishing replication timing control in this regulation. Global early replication disrupts nucleosome positioning and transcription factor binding during S-phase， suggesting that the rate of S-phase is important to regulate the chromatin landscape. Together these data provide new insight into the role of a temporal order of origin firing for coordinating replication， gene expression and chromatin establishment as occurs in the early embryo.,Examination of replication progression by high-throughput sequencing of DNA in two strains (sml1_delta SSDDCS， sml1_delta) upon a genome-wide perturbation in the timing of replication initiation.,36253803,Genome Biol
Comparative analysis of liver tissues from heahtly mice and mice suffering from cholangitis,GSE179993,Mus musculus,The goal of the study was to compare the transcriptomic signature (by bulk RNA-sequencing) of hepatic tissues of mice either healthy/normal or affected with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or primary biliary cholangitis mouse (PBC) (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021). Transcriptomic analyses revealed mostly convergent alterations in the gene expression patterns when PBC and PSC were compared to normal， age- and sex-matched controls. Gene Ontology (GO) term analyses of the modulated mRNAs revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in inflammation， immune response and chemotaxis of different leukocyte subsets . The expression of genes listed under the GO terms âinflammationâ and âneutrophilâ was not significantly different (p>0.5， Student t-test) between PBC and PSC. In sharp contrast， genes listed under the GO terms âT cellâ and âB cellâ were significantly (p<0.05， Student t-test) upregulated in PBC compared to PSC livers. Deeper analysis of the aforementioned liver RNA-seq dataset indicated that several genes specifically involved in Th1 and Tc1 responses were upregulated in PBC livers with respect to controls and， in some cases also with respect to PSC. Especially， this applies to Tc1-related genes encoding the markers CD8a， CD274 (best known as PD-L1)， UL16 binding protein 1 (ULBP1)， IFNÎ³， G Protein-Coupled Receptor 18 (GPR18)， the transcription factor suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)， and the cytotoxic protease granzyme B (GzmB) (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021).,Autoimmune primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) was induced in C57Bl/6 mice as described before: Chang et al.， 2014; Wakabayashi et al.， 2008. Briefly， mice were immunized with 100 Âµg of 2-octynoic acid BSA conjugate (2OA-BSA) intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a mix of PBS and complete Freundâs adjuvant (CFA， Sigma-Aldrich) at day 0 and were reboosted at days 14 and 28 with 2OA-BSA and incomplete Freundâs Adjuvant (IFA， Sigma Aldrich). Concomitantly with the two first injections of 2OA-BSA， mice were also injected intravenously (i.v.) with 2 Î¼g of Î±-galactosylceramide (Î±-GalCer， Abcam) in PBS.Non-autoimmune primary sclerosing cholangitis model (PSC) was induced in C57Bl/6 mice as previously published: Fickert et al.， 2007; Ikenaga et al.， 2017. They were fed the SAFE A04 diet (SAFEâ¢) containing 0.089% (in weight) of 3，5-diethoxycarbonyl-1，4-dihydrocollidine (DDC， Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 weeks (from day 0 to 14). After one week of recovery with the regular diet， mice were fed again with the DDC-supplemented diet for one more week.  For bulk mRNA-sequecing， 4 healthy/normal mouse livers， 3 PBC mouse livers， and 3 PSC mouse livers were collected at day 35 post-cholangitis induction (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021).,34495298,J Exp Med

Glyoxal as alternative fixative for single cell transcriptome experiments,GSE163736,Drosophila melanogaster;Homo sapiens,Within just a few years single cell RNA sequencing has become a frequently used standard method in many research fWithin just a few years single cell RNA sequencing has become a frequently used standard method in many research facilities worldwide. Declining sequencing costs and further refinements of the available protocols will pave the way for previously unimaginable prospects， up to single cell transcriptomic maps of entire organisms. The sample collection process can constitute a severe bottleneck in scRNA-seq experiments especially for solid tissues. Lengthy dissociation protocols are not uncommon to obtain sufficient amounts of starting material and can lead to significant changes in the gene expression profiles of cells. Preservation of the transcriptome prior to single cell dissociation can overcome this setback. Here we present an extensive performance analysis of glyoxal as an alternative fixative for scRNA-seq application. High numbers of transcripts and genes were recovered from glyoxal-fixed cells subjected to Drop-seq methodology with the best performance in Drosophila cells. While glyoxal fixation in Drosophila Kc167 and human HEK 293T cells revealed transcriptome data similar to the unfixed condition， reduced library complexity was observed for the human sample. We found the integrity of Drosophila intestinal tissue maintained following glyoxal fixation， while dissociation of the fixed tissue allowed sufficient cell isolation. In conclusion， we present glyoxal as a well-suited fixative for Drosophila samples that allows high-quality single cell transcriptomic analysis and successful intestinal tissue disaggregationcilities worldwide.

Single cell analysis of protein epitopes and chromatin accessibility using PHAGE-ATAC [Species_Mix_GFP],GSE157485,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Single cell multi-omic readouts of both the cellular transcriptome and proteome have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehensively characterize cellular states. Most approaches in this area rely on oligonucleotide barcode-conjugated antibodies that target cell surface epitopes of interest， enabling their concomitant detection with the transcriptome. However， a similar high-throughput measurement of other cellular modalities such as the epigenome in concert with protein levels have not been described. Moreover， detection of epitopes is limited to antigens for which a specific antibody is available. Here， we introduce PHAGE-ATAC， an approach that enables the scalable and simultaneous detection of protein levels and chromatin accessibility data in single cells using the assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). Quantitative detection of proteins by PHAGE-ATAC is accomplished through the use of engineerable nanobody-displaying phages that are genetically barcoded within the nanobody-encoding phagemids. We demonstrate the utility of PHAGE-ATAC for multimodal single cell genomic analysis in both cell lines and primary human cells. Analogous to phage display approaches， we further establish a synthetic high-complexity library of nanobody-displaying phages and demonstrate its utility to select novel antigen-specific nanobodies for PHAGE-ATAC.,A 2:1:1 ratio of NIH3T3， EGFP+ HEK293T， and EGFP- HEK29T3 were stained with phages against EGFP carrying a known anti-EGFP nanobody.

Single-cell CRISPR immune screens reveal immunological roles of tumor intrinsic factors,GSE206107,Mus musculus,Genetic screens using CRISPR technology are widely exploited to explore novel targets and discover resistance mechanisms of cancer treatments， including cancer immunotherapy. As it is a time- and resource-intensive manner to individually validate potential candidates and clarify their working mechanisms， single-cell CRISPR screen platforms are designed and developed to parallelly characterize these factors and explore underlying mechanisms in a high-throughput manner. By leveraging the resources generated in our previous studies， Perturb-seq featured with capture sequences integrated into gRNA-expressing vectors and CROP-seq featured with poly(A)-tailed gRNA transcripts under the control of RNAPII promoters were selected among several independent single-cell CRISPR screen platforms to directly evaluate the performance of different scCRISPR screen platforms in determining underlying mechanisms of tumor intrinsic immune regulation and optimize experimental conditions and data analysis in immune-related scCRISPR screens. In the study， the influence of each perturbation on the gene expression profile and the response to in vitro T cell killing and in vivo anti-PD-1 treatment were comprehensively appraised at the single-cell level. It is clearly demonstrated that scCRISPR screen platforms could efficiently characterize gene expression profiles and perturbation effects present in individual cells during both in vitro and in vivo immune-related screen processes. Particularly， scCRISPR screen platforms presented more detail to determine heterogeneous change of gene expression in distinct knockout tumor cells in the presence of immune attack which cannot be easily assessed by canonical bulk RNA-seq. Collectively， scCRISPR screen technologies provide scalable and reliable platforms to validate identified tumor intrinsic immune factors identified from genome-wide CRISPR screens and elucidate their potential working mechanisms.,We generated high-throughput scCRISPR datasets of MC38 mouse cells with various CRISPR perturbation， under in vitro and in vivo conditions， with and without T cell killing/anti-PD-1 treatment. Both mRNA and gRNA of cells were profiled by Perturb-seq and CROP-seq to determine the transcriptomic and purturbation status.,36518525,NAR Cancer

T cell repertoire in cholangiocarcinoma lesion and liver of a mouse affected with primary biliary cholangitis,GSE180288,Mus musculus,We report in this study the expansion of T cell clonotypes inflitrating both ectopic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and liver tissues in a mouse suffering from primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021).   We wondered whether the specificity of T cells found in PBC livers and tumors developing post-PBC might be shared to some extent， comparing them to circulating T cells from the blood (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021). Single-cell TCR sequencing coupled to single-cell RNA sequencing (scTCR/RNA-seq) led to the identification of 8112 distinct clonotypes with a hierarchy of clonotypes enrichment that was significantly higher in PBC livers than in peripheral blood， as well as in CCA compared to blood and liver. Indeed， 12 distinct clonotypes accounted for ~20% of the tumor T cell infiltrate. The overlap of clonotypes between liver and tumor was superior to the overlap between blood and liver， or blood and tumor. Among the 128 clonotypes enriched (i.e. accounting for > 0.1% of total T cells infiltrating the tissue) in the tumor， 25 were also detected and enriched in the liver. Two clonotypes (#2 and #13) were particularly expanded， each representing over 0.5% of the total T cell population in both liver and tumor post-PBC (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021).   Bioinformatic analysis of the scRNA-seq data of total T cells isolated from the liver and tumor of a PBC mouse revealed a net distinction between the transcriptome of T lymphocytes located in the two organs. Only one phenotypic cluster (h) was observed in both liver and tumor. The 25 liver/tumor dual-enriched (>0.1%) clonotypes were spread across few clusters (mostly c， j， k in the tumor; b and i in the liver). Among these clusters， three corresponded to CD8+ T cells (c， i， k) and two corresponded to CD4+ T cells (b， j). They exhibited a preponderant Tc1/Th1 polarization as illustrated by the expression of the enhancers Tbx21 and/or Eomes， and of effector molecules， namely IFNÎ³ for Th1 (b， j)， or the cytotoxic markers granzymes B and K for Tc1 (c， i， k) (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021). Interestingly， the two clusters containing most of the enriched CD4+ T cell clonotypes presented a multifunctional signature characterized by the co-expression of IFNÎ³ along with either IL4 (cluster b in the liver) or GzmB and KLRG1 (cluster j in the tumor). Clearly， the two most enriched clonotypes shared between CCA tumor and PBC liver belonged to the category of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (clusters c + k in tumor， and cluster i in the liver). Moreover， they showed signs of prolonged activation/exhaustion with the expression of Pdcd1 (encoding PD-1)， Lag3， Harvc2/Tim3 and Tigit， yet in a lesser extent than another cluster of CD8+ T cells (tumor cluster f) that contains only little shared clonotypes (Paillet et al， J Exp Med， 2021).,Autoimmune primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) was induced in a C57Bl/6 mice as described before: Chang et al.， 2014; Wakabayashi et al.， 2008. Briefly， mice were immunized with 100 Âµg of 2-octynoic acid BSA conjugate (2OA-BSA) intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a mix of PBS and complete Freundâs adjuvant (CFA， Sigma-Aldrich) at day 0 and were reboosted at days 14 and 28 with 2OA-BSA and incomplete Freundâs Adjuvant (IFA， Sigma Aldrich). Concomitantly with the two first injections of 2OA-BSA， mice were also injected intravenously (i.v.) with 2 Î¼g of Î±-galactosylceramide (Î±-GalCer， Abcam) in PBS.   Thirty-five days after the beginning of cholangitis induction， 3x10^6 SB1-JP4 cells (murine cholangiocarcinoma cells) were resuspended in 100 ÂµL of PBS and injected subcutaneously， under anesthesia with 2.5% isoflurane， in the right flank of C57Bl/6 mice.  For sinlge cell (sc)-RNA-seq and sc-TCR (T cell receptor)-seq， blood was drawn 7 days before and 34 days after PBC induction. One hundred five days after cholangitis induction (equivalent to 70 days after the engraftment of the CCA cells)， blood， liver and the CCA tumor were collected from a PBC mouse (Paillet at al， J Exp Med， 2021).,34495298,J Exp Med

Single-cell multi-omics profiling links dynamic DNA methylation to cell fate decisions during early mammalian organogenesis [scNMT BS-seq],GSE204904,Mus musculus,Perturbation of DNA methyltransferases and of the active demethylation pathway via TET enzymes results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis， yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from a variety of DNA methylation mutant mouse embryos during mouse early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However， DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases， in particular， a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos. This study therefore provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at whole organism scale， and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.,768 single cells isolated from TET triple knockout chimeric mouse embryos at E8.5 and processed using either scNMT-seq (640 cells， Clark et al 2018) or scM&T-seq (128 cells， Angermueller et al 2016),36163261,Genome Biol

Fibro-Adipogenic muscle Progenitors (FAP) and myogenic progenitors (MPs) display a distinct miRNA expression profile that is modulated in response to TGFÎ²1,GSE157674,Homo sapiens,"Fibrosis is a deleterious invasion of tissues associated with many pathological conditions， such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) for which no cure is at present available for its prevention or its treatment. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are resident cells in the human skeletal muscle and can differentiate into myofibroblasts， which represent the key cell population responsible for fibrosis. In this study， we delineated the pool of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are specifically modulated by TGFÎ²1 in FAPs versus myogenic progenitors (MPs) by a global miRNome analysis. A subset of candidates， including several ""FibromiRs""， was found differentially expressed between FAPs and MPs and was also deregulated in DMD versus healthy biopsies. Among them， the expression of the TGFÎ²1-induced miR-199a~214 cluster was strongly correlated with the fibrotic score in DMD biopsies. Loss-of-function experiments in FAPs indicated that a miR-214-3p inhibitor efficiently blocked expression of fibrogenic markers in both basal conditions and following TGFÎ²1 stimulation. We found that FGFR1 is a functional target of miR-214-3p， preventing the signaling of the anti-fibrotic FGF2 pathway during FAP fibrogenesis. Overall， our work demonstrates that the Â« FibromiR Â» miR-214-3p is a key activator of FAP fibrogenesis by modulating the FGF2/FGFR1/TGFÎ² axis， opening new avenues for the treatment of DMD.",Small RNA-seq of FAPs and MPs from three muscle biopsies treated or not by TGFÎ²1 was performed and showed that FAPs and MPs expressed very different subsets of miRNAs. A subset of 59 miRNAs efficiently discriminated FAPs- and MPs-derived samples. Moreover， additional miRNAs were differentially regulated by TGFÎ²1， pointing out a specific miRNome modulation in the 2 muscle cell progenitors during differentiation.FAPs and MPs from three healthy skeletal muscles were treated or not with 5 ng/mL TGFÎ²1 for 48h， total RNA was purified and subjected to Small RNA-seq， for a total of 12 distinct samples,34360002,Cells

Inter-gastruloid heterogeneity revealed by single cell transcriptomics time course: implications for organoid based perturbation studies,GSE212050,Mus musculus,Recent advances in organoid and genome editing technologies are allowing for perturbation experiments at an unprecedented scale. However， before doing such experiments it is important to understand the gene expression profile in each of the organoidâs cells， as well as how much heterogeneity there is between individual organoids. Here we characterise an organoid model of mouse gastrulation called gastruloids using single cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids at half-day intervals between day 3 and day 5 of differentiation (roughly corresponding to E6.5-E8.75 in vivo). Our study reveals multiple differentiation trajectories that have hitherto not been characterised in gastruloids. Intriguingly， we observe that individual gastruloids displayed a strong bias towards producing either mesodermal (largely somitic) or ectodermal (specifically neural) cell types. This bifurcation is already seen at the earliest sampled time point， and is characterised by increased activity of WNT-associated pathways in mesodermally-biased gastruloids as compared to neurally-biased gastruloids. Notably， at day 5， mesodermal gastruloids show an increase in the proportion of neural cells， while neural gastruloids do not produce notably more mesodermal cells. This is in line with previous studies on how the balance between these cell types is regulated. We demonstrate using in silico simulations that without proper understanding of the inter-organoid heterogeneity， perturbation experiments have either very high false positive or negative rates， depending on the statistical model used. Thus in future studies， modelling of inter-organoid heterogeneity will be crucial when designing organoid-based perturbation studies.,MULTI-seq (10X + individual gastruloid barcoding) for gastruloids between day 3 and day 5 of differentiation at half day intervals. A total of 4 experiments were performed. In the first experiment， day 3 and day 4 gastruloids were sequenced using 10X without MULTI-seq. The first MULTI-seq experiment involved 24 day 5 gastruloids spread over 3 10X lanes. The second MULTI-seq experiment involved 3 pools of day 3 and day 3.5 gastruloids (âexp2A_d3_d3.5â， âexp2C_d3_d3.5â， âexp2D_d3_d3.5â; note pools B and D were not sent for 10X sequencing)， as well as 3 pools of day 4 and day 4.5 gastruloids (âexp3A_d4_d4.5â， âexp3B_d4_d4.5â， âexp3C_d4_d4.5â). Unfortunately， the day 3 and day 3.5 gastruloid data quality was too poor and these data were excluded in downstream processinng. For the day 4 and day 4.5 gastruloids， out of the 3 pools (pool A， B， and C)， only pools B and C were sequenced， and from these only lanes (samples) 2 and 3 from pool B， and lanes 1 and 2 from pool C. The third experiment involved 1 pool of 24 day 3 gastruloids， spread across 2 10X lanes (âexp4_d3â)， as well as one pool of 16 day 3.5 and 16 day 4 gastruloids， spread across 4 10X lanes (âexp5_d3.5_d4â)， and finally 16 day 4.5 and 16 day 5 gastruloids， spread across 3 10X lanes (âexp6_d4.5_d5â). The MULTI-seq barcodes for this third experiment were additionally resequenced at higher depth and using 16 PCR amplification cycles during library preparation due to low yield.,nan,

Single-cell landscape of peripheral immune responses to fatal SFTS,GSE175499,Homo sapiens,We performed scRNA-seq on 27 PBMC samples from 15 SFTS patients (including four deceased and 11 surviving) and four healthy controls. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed in SFTS and characterized by monocyte shift to intermediate type along with complement activation， perturbation of plasmablasts composition， and highly exhausted T cells， all were correlated with lethal consequences. We identified the overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes across most immune cell types post SFTSV infection， which were simultaneously related to older age， high viremia and hyper-inflammation. These data collectively supported the intermediate monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts to be major targets for SFTSV infection， and proposed the pivotal role of IFN-I response in exacerbating hyper-inflammation and lethal SFTS， which might help to identify therapeutic strategies for SFTS.,A cohort study was used to identify the role of peripheral immune responses in SFTS infection. A total of 15 SFTS patients， including 11 with the CT values of RT-qPCR ranging from 25 to 30 and four with the CT values of RT-qPCR less than 25， were prospectively sampled for scRNA-seq and flow cytometry analysis.,34818556,Cell Rep

Mapping Transcriptomic Vector Field of Single Cells,GSE193517,Homo sapiens,Single-cell (sc)RNA-seq， together with RNA velocity and metabolic labeling， reveals cellular states and transitions at unprecedented resolution. Fully exploiting these data， however， requires kinetic models capable of unveiling governing regulatory functions. Here， we introduce an analytical framework dynamo， which infers absolute RNA velocity， reconstructs continuous vector fields that predict cell fates， employs differential geometry to extract underlying regulations， and ultimately predicts optimal reprogramming paths and perturbation outcomes. We highlight dynamoâs power to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional splicing-based RNA velocity analyses to enable accurate velocity estimations on a metabolically labeled human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset. Furthermore， differential geometry analyses reveal mechanisms driving early megakaryocyte appearance and elucidate asymmetrical regulation within the PU.1-GATA1 circuit. Leveraging the least-action-path method， dynamo accurately predicts drivers of numerous hematopoietic transitions. Finally， in silico perturbations predict cell-fate diversions induced by gene perturbations. Dynamo， thus， represents an important step in advancing quantitative and predictive theories of cell-state transitions.,This study contains three main experiments. The first two are about 10x scRNA-seq experiment and sequential lineage tracing of HL60 cell differentiation with static barcode and scSLAM-seq， respectively. The third one is about profiling human hematopoiesis in vitro with scNT-seq.,nan,

Characterizing the molecular regulation of inhibitory immune checkpoints with multi-modal single-cell screens.,GSE153056,Homo sapiens,The expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-L1 is frequently observed in human cancers and can lead to the suppression of T-cell mediated immune responses. Here we apply ECCITE-seq， a technology which combines pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell mRNA and surface protein measurements， to explore the molecular networks that regulate PD-L1 expression. We also develop a computational framework， mixscape， that substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio in single-cell perturbation screens by identifying and removing confounding sources of variation. Applying these tools， we identify and validate regulators of PD-L1， and leverage our multi-modal data to identify both transcriptional and post-transcriptional modes of regulation. In particular， we discover that the kelch-like protein KEAP1 and the transcriptional activator NRF2， mediate levels of PD-L1 upregulation after IFNÎ³ stimulation. Our results identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of immune checkpoints and present a powerful analytical framework for the analysis of multi-modal single-cell perturbation screens.,Identification of novel immune checkpoint regulators using ECCITE-seq.Please note that the  ECCITE_ADT_Barcodes.csv and ECCITE_Arrayed_ADT_Barcodes.csv files are identical.  To avoid any confusion， duplicated files were generated to link to  each experiment type for users who may try to analyze a specific experiment (ECCITE or ECCITE_Arrayed).,33649593,Nat Genet

Role of HLR1， an ancient light-harvesting protein of PSI， in light absorption and photoprotection in Nannochloropsis oceanica,GSE156681,Nannochloropsis oceanica,We isolated a Nannochloropsis oceanica LHCR mutant， named hlr1， which exhibits a greater tolerance to high light (HL) stress compared to the wild type.Global gene expression of WT and the hlr1 mutant， as a function of time in dark incubation (DK) and under high irradiance was measured by mRNA-Seq,Total RNA of the algal cells was prepared using an RNA miniprep kit (CWBIO) and the concentrations were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo). Libraries were constructed and then sequenced using the HiSeq 2500 (Illumina)， which generated about 18 million read pairs per sample (ANNOROAD). Raw reads containing adapter， poly-N， and low-quality reads were filtered and the effective data were mapped with the Nannochloropsis reference genome using TopHat (version 2.0.12). After excluding the ribosomal RNA or transfer RNA， we estimated the abundance of the transcripts using RPKM (Reads per Kilo bases per Million reads) 62. The p values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg method 63. Corrected p valueï¹¤0.05 and fold change more than two were set as the threshold for significant difference in expression. GO annotations of the data provided by our RNA-Seq analysis were performed using PANTHER (www.pantherdb.org/pathway/) 64.

Cytotoxic CNS-associated T cells drive axon degeneration in aging and myelin disease,GSE138891,Mus musculus,1. Aging is a major risk factor for the development of nervous system functional decline， even in the absence of diseases or trauma. The axonâmyelin units and synaptic terminals are some of the neural structures most vulnerable to aging-related deterioration， but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the peripheral nervous system， macrophagesâimportant representatives of the innate immune systemâare prominent drivers of structural and functional decline of myelinated fibers and motor endplates during aging. Similarly， in the aging central nervous system (CNS)， microglial cells promote damage of myelinated axons and synapses. Here we examine the role of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes， a type of adaptive immune cells previously identified as amplifiers of axonal perturbation in various models of genetically mediated CNS diseases but understudied in the aging CNS. We show that accumulation of CD8+ T cells drives axon degeneration in the normal aging mouse CNS and contributes to age-related cognitive and motor decline. We characterize CD8+ T-cell population heterogeneity in the adult and aged mouse brain by single-cell transcriptomics and identify aging-related changes. Mechanistically， we provide evidence that CD8+ T cells drive axon degeneration in a T-cell receptor- and granzyme B-dependent manner. Cytotoxic neural damage is further aggravated by systemic inflammation in aged but not adult mice. We also find increased densities of T cells in white matter autopsy material from older humans. Our results suggest that targeting CD8+ CNS-associated T cells in older adults might mitigate aging-related decline of brain structure and function.   2. Myelin defects lead to neurological dysfunction in various diseases and in normal aging. Chronic neuroinflammation often contributes to axon-myelin damage in these  conditions and can be initiated and/or sustained by perturbed myelinating glia. We have previously shown that distinct mutations in the PLP1 gene result in neurodegeneration that is largely driven by adaptive immune cells. Here we characterize CD8+ CNS-associated T cells in these myelin mutants using single-cell transcriptomics and identify population heterogeneity and disease-associated changes. We demonstrate that early sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation attenuates the recruitment of T cells and neural damage， while later targeting of CNS-associated T cell populations is inefficient and has no effect on neurodegeneration. Applying bone marrow chimerism and utilizing random X chromosome inactivation， we provide evidence that axonal damage is driven by cytotoxic， antigen specific CD8+ T cells that target mutant oligodendrocyte myelin. These findings offer insights into neural-immune interactions and are of translational relevance for neurological conditions associated with myelin defects and neuroinflammation.,To characterize CD8+ CNS-associated T cells we comprehensively analyzed their transcriptomic profiles using single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45highCD8+ T lymphocytes freshly sorted from 12- and 24-month-old brains， as well as from 12-month-old brains from mice with PLP mutations. A total of 5，017， 5，504， and 6，467 cells were captured and a median gene number per cell of 1，325， 1，279， and 1，283 could be retrieved for adult and aged cells and cells from myelin mutants， respectively.,37182098,iScience

We identified eIF4A2 and defined its mechanistic action through Rps26-depleted and -containing ribosomes in translational initiation activation of mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors and H3.3 for embryonic and extraembryonic lineage repression， respectively. eIF4A2 also mediates translation initiation activation of Ddx6， which acts together with eIF4A2 to restrict the totipotent 2-cell (2C) transcription program in ESCs through Zscan4 mRNA degradation and translation repression. Knockdown of eIF4A2 disrupts ESC proteome causing the loss of stemness in ESCs as well as in human glioblastomas where eIF4A2 is highly enriched. Collectively， our study establishes an eIF4A2-mediated translation initiation control of stemness and provides insight into cancer therapeutics targeting the translation initiation machinery.,eIF4A2 transcriptome profiling was investigated via RNA-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells.,35353581,Sci Adv

Multi-omics gene regulatory network analysis of resting and stimulated PBMCs [PBMC isolate scRNA-seq],GSE178430,Homo sapiens,Cells require coordinated control over gene expression changes when responding to environmental stimuli. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies have enabled studies of regulatory dynamics associated with cellular perturbation response in immune cells. However， associating these changes to underlying differences in epigenetic regulation through integration of multi-omic data has not been achieved at single-cell resolution. Here， we apply single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq to assay chromatin accessibility and gene expression in resting and stimulated human blood cells. Collectively， we generate ~91，000 high-coverage single-cell profiles， allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory landscape of immunological response across cell types， stimuli and time. Advancing tools to integrate multiomic data， we connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes， identifying key regulatory hubs associated with immune signaling and stress response. Subsequently， we design FigR - a method to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate TF regulators across single cells. Importantly， construction of a GRN using stimulus response data identifies TF regulatory activity associated withÂ  genetic variants in inflammatory diseases. Lastly， we assess the time-dependent regulatory dynamics of immune stimulation， where we find that cells alter chromatin accessibility prior to productive gene expression， a process occurring at time scales of minutes. Extending this concept of chromatin-mediated priming， and incorporating regulatory relationships defined by FigR， we detect a rare subpopulation of monocytes marked by a primed chromatin state predictive of enhanced immunological response. Overall， we build upon computational tools for GRN construction and demonstrate the utility of GRNs for analysis of multi-omic single cell data.,Human isolated peripheral blood CD4+， CD8+， CD14+， CD19+ and CD56+ cells were processed using the BioRad SureCell single-cell RNA-seq platform across multiple channels in the instrument.,nan,

Differential expression of circRNAs discriminates between different maturational stages of human intrathymic thymocytes.,GSE178889,Homo sapiens,Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable single stranded RNA molecules which form a covalently closed continuous loop. They are involved in multiple biological processes，  functioning mainly through interactions with microRNAs and proteins or by the expression of specific peptides. Preliminary data exist on circRNA expression in different peripheral blood cell populations. Deregulation of circRNAs has been shown to be key in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However， a detailed analysis on circRNAs expression in intrathymic thymocyte populations was still missing and might be key to understanding thymus development as well as tumours arising in the lymphoblastic line. The aim of this study was to investigate whether circRNAs are differentially expressed in thymocytes at different maturational stages during the intrathymic differentiation process.,Differential circRNA expression analysis in thymocytes at different stages of intrathymic differentiation,35447889,Noncoding RNA

Transcription Factor Protein Interactomes Reveal Genetic Determinants in Heart Disease,GSE159411,Homo sapiens,Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is present in 1% of live births， and while large-scale genetic studies have uncovered genes associated with CHDs， identifying causal mutations remains a challenge. We hypothesized that genetic determinants for CHDs could be found in the protein interactomes of GATA4 and TBX5， two cardiac transcription factors (TFs) that cause CHDs. Defining their interactomes in human cardiac progenitors via affinity purification-mass spectrometry and integrating the results with genetic data from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomic Consortium (PCGC) revealed an enrichment of de novo variants among proteins that interact with GATA4 or TBX5. A consolidative score designed to prioritize TF interactome members based on distinctive variant， gene， and proband features identified numerous likely CHD-causing genes， including the epigenetic reader GLYR1. GLYR1 and GATA4 widely co-occupied cardiac developmental genes， resulting in co-activation， and the GLYR1 variant associated with CHD disrupted interaction with GATA4. This integrative proteomic and genetic approach provides a framework for prioritizing and interrogating the contribution of genetic variants in CHD and can be extended to other genetic diseases.,3 replicates for each condition were ran for Bulk RNAseq after siRNA knockdown of GATA4 or siControl in hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors (3x siRNA Control and 3 x siRNA GATA4).2 replicates for each sample were ran for Bulk RNAseq after siRNA knockdown of GLYR1 or siControl in hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors (2x siRNA Control and 2x siRNA GLYR1 ).4-5 replicates for each sample were ran for Bulk RNAseq of day6 hiPSC derived cardiac progenitors (CPs) (5x WT CPs， 4x GATA4 knockout CPs and 5x TBX5 knockout CPs).3-1 replicates for each sample were ran for ChIPseq on day6 WT hiPSC derived cardiac progenitors (CPs)，  (3x GLYR1 WT CPs， 2x H3K36me3 WT CPs， 2x GATA4 WT CPs， 2x TBX5 WT CPs， 2x NKX2-5 WT CPs， 1x MEIS1 WT CPs， 1x ISL1 WT CPs).2 replicates for each sample were ran for Bulk RNAseq of day0 WT hiPSC (2x GLYR1 WT hiPSC and 2x H3K36me3 WT hiPSCs， ).1-3 replicate single-cell RNA-seq samples at 3 time-points (hiPSC， Day 6 and Day 18 into cardiac differentiation) under two genotypes (WT and P496L GLYR1 mutant) were processed across 3 batches (see column Y). For the analyses to infer differential binding between the two genotypes (WT and P496L GLYR1 mutant)， 3 replicates for each genotype  were used for GLYR1 ChIPseq in hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors processed in batch 2 (see column Y). 5 replicates under each of the hiPSC and cardiac progenitor stages of GLYR1 ChIPseq were used to infer differential GLYR1 binding between the two stages.,35182466,Cell

Single cell analysis of endometriosis reveals a coordinated transcriptional program driving immunotolerance and angiogenesis across eutopic and ectopic tissues,GSE179640,Homo sapiens,Endometriosis is characterized by growth of endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus affecting many women during their reproductive age， causing years of pelvic pain and potential infertility. Its pathophysiology remains largely unknown， limiting early diagnosis and treatment. We characterized peritoneal and ovarian lesions at single-cell transcriptome resolution and compared to matched eutopic endometrium， control endometrium， and organoids derived from these tissues， generating data on over 122，000 cells across 14 individuals. We spatially localized many of the cell types using imaging mass cytometry. We identify a perivascular mural cell unique to the peritoneal lesions with dual roles in angiogenesis promotion and immune cell trafficking. We define an immunotolerant peritoneal niche， fundamental differences in eutopic endometrium and between lesions microenvironments， and an unreported progenitor-like epithelial cell subpopulation. Altogether， this study provides a holistic view of the endometriosis microenvironment representing a comprehensive cell atlas of the disease in hormonally treated patients， essential information for advancing therapeutics and diagnostics.,Biopsies were collected from a total of 27 patients， 19 with confirmed endometriosis and 8 patients control. Biopsies were subjected to single cell experiments， bulk sequencing and cell hashing on patient-derived organoid.

Analysis of the impact of FOXA1 expression on MDA::ER E2-sensitive transcriptomes and ER cistromes [ChIP-Seq data],GSE55740,Homo sapiens,The primordial actions of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in controlling breast cancer cells proliferation rate are particularly documented. However， reintroducing ER into ER-negative cells does not reprogram their transcriptome towards an estrogen-sensitive growth phenotype. Member of the Forkhead (FKH) family of transcription factors， FOXA1 has been characterized to be essential for the appropriate binding of ER onto chromatin in MCF-7 cells. FOXA1 pioneering actions involve modulations of histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs) and local depletion in methylated CpGs. Using MDA-MB231 cells which are ER and FOXA1 negative， we aimed at determining whether the introduction of ER and FOXA1 would be sufficient to restore an estrogen-sensitive growth and to coincidently reprogram chromatin. We used ChIP-seq experiments to map ER and FOXA1 binding sites (BSs) and to profile H3K4me2 and H3K27ac marks， and surprisingly observed that FOXA1 had rather a global negative impact on ER actions， associated with an inhibition of growth and a reorientation of the transcriptome of the cells towards cell death. We demonstrate that the re-introduction of FOXA1 in these cells actually competes for the binding and pioneering actions of FOXA2， another FKH protein， on a number of ER BSs. As demonstrated for its alter ego FOXA1 in MCF-7 cells， abrogating FOXA2 expression drastically diminished ER binding onto its cognate sites， associated with a local loss of HPTMs for active chromatin.,Whole-genome analysis of estrogen receptor (ER) and its FOXA1 and/or FOXA2 pioneering factors binding events associated with the cartography of two histone marks (H3K4me2 and H3K27ac) in four ER/FOXA1 positive or negative breast cancer cells.,nan,

P-selectin identifies molecularly and functionally aged long-term hematopoietic stem cells in Mus musculus C57BL/6 female mice,GSE194273,Mus musculus,Aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) display myeloid-biased differentiation and reduced regenerative potential. In this study， we uncover that P-selectin (Selp) marks a subset of aged HSCs with reduced repopulation capacity. This population of HSCs expresses a prominent aging transcriptome. Overexpression of Selp in young HSCs impaired long-term reconstitution potential and repressed erythropoiesis. We show that IL-1Î² is elevated in aged bone marrow and administration of IL-1Î² induces expression of Selp and other aging-associated genes in HSCs. Finally， we demonstrate that transplantation of aged HSCs into young recipients restores a young-like transcriptome， specifically by repressing pro-inflammatory pathways， highlighting the important role of the bone marrow microenvironment in HSC aging.,Pre-transplant: 5000 Selp low HSCs (lineage negative， Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD48- CD150+ Selp low) and 5000 Selp high HSCs (lineage negative， Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD48- CD150+ Selp high)， sorted from 4 old (>24 months) mice， were used for RNA-seq. Post-transplant: 1000 old Selp low and Selp high HSCs were transplanted to lethally irradiated young recipients (10-16 weeks)， respectively.

Comparative functional genomics identifies unique molecular features of EPSCs [ATAC-seq],GSE201301,Mus musculus,Extended pluripotent or expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) possess the superior developmental potential to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However， the molecular underpinning of their in vitro maintenance is not well defined. We comparatively studied transcriptome， chromatin accessibility， active histone modification chromatin marks and relative proteomes of ESCs and the two well-established EPSCs to probe the molecular foundation of their unique developmental potential. We found a great overlap in the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles and reliance on pluripotency factors Oct4， Sox2， and Nanog for self-renewal between ESCs and EPSCs. Importantly， we identified a subset of genomic， transcriptomic， and proteomic signatures that distinguish EPSCs from ESCs in transcriptional and translational regulation as well as epigenetic and metabolic control. We also identified molecular differences between the two well-established EPSCs. Our study provides a rich resource for dissecting the regulatory network underlying the developmental potency of EPSCs and exploring alternative states of totipotency.,ATAC-seq analysis of mouse extended pluripotent or expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs).,35961778,Life Sci Alliance
Gene Regulatory Network Reconfiguration in Direct Lineage Reprogramming,GSE217675,Mus musculus,In direct lineage reprogramming， transcription factor (TF) overexpression reconfigures Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) to convert cell identities between fully differentiated cell types. We previously developed CellOracle， a computational pipeline that integrates single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles to infer GRNs. CellOracle leverages these inferred GRNs to simulate gene expression changes in response to TF perturbation， enabling network re-configuration during reprogramming to be interrogated in silico. Here， we integrate CellOracle analysis with lineage tracing of fibroblast to induced endoderm progenitor (iEP) conversion， a prototypical direct lineage reprogramming paradigm. By linking early network state to reprogramming success or failure， we reveal distinct network configurations underlying different reprogramming outcomes. Using these network analyses and in silico simulation of TF perturbation， we identify new factors to coax cells into successfully converting cell identity， uncovering a central role for the AP-1 subunit Fos with the Hippo signaling effector， Yap1. Together， these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations at high resolution， providing new mechanistic insights into the regulation and reprogramming of cell identity.,For lineage tracing， scRNA-seq was performed for CellTagged in vitro reprogramming MEFs at multiple time points to allow longitudinal lineage tracing.

Compressed Perturb-seq: highly efficient screens for regulatory circuits using random composite perturbations,GSE221321,Homo sapiens,Pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA-seq readout (Perturb-seq) have emerged as a key technique in functional genomics， but are limited in scale by cost and combinatorial complexity. Here， we reimagine Perturb-seqâs design through the lens of algorithms applied to random， low-dimensional observations. We present compressed Perturb-seq， in which we measure multiple perturbations per cell or multiple cells per droplet， and decompress these measurements by leveraging the sparse structure of regulatory circuits. Applying compressed Perturb-seq to 598 genes in the immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide， we achieve the same accuracy as conventional Perturb-seq at 4 to 20-fold reduced cost， with greater power to learn genetic interactions. We identify known and novel regulators of immune responses and uncover evolutionarily constrained genes with downstream targets enriched for immune disease heritability， including many missed by existing GWAS or trans-eQTL studies. Our framework enables new scales of interrogation for a foundational method in functional genomics.,scRNA-seq of THP-1 cells expressing Cas9 or dCas9-KRAB transduced with sgRNA libraries targeting 598 genes as well as non-targeting controls， using both the conventional Perturb-seq experimental protocol as well as our modifications for compressed Perturb-seq.

Uncovering the role admixture in health disparities: Association of hepatocyte gene expression and DNA methylation to African Ancestry in African-Americans [RNA-seq],GSE222593,Homo sapiens,In African Americans (AA)， the proportion of West African ancestry (WAA) may explain the genetic drivers of health disparities in disease. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from sixty AA-derived primary hepatocytes identified 32 gene expression profiles associated with WAA (FDR <0.05) with enrichment in angiogenesis and inflammatory pathways (FDR <0.1). Association of DNA methylation to WAA identified 1037 differentially methylated regions (FDR <0.05)， with hypomethylated genes enriched for drug response pathways. Within the PharmGKB pharmacogene， VDR， PTGIS， ALDH1A1， CYP2C19 and P2RY1 were associated with WAA (p <0.05) with replication of CYP2C19 and VDR in the GTEx liver cohort. For every 1% increment in WAA， P2RY1 gene expression increased by 1.6% and CYP2C19 gene expression decreased by 1.4%， suggesting effects on clopidogrel response and platelet aggregation. We conclude that WAA contributes to variablity in hepatic gene expression and DNA methylation with identified genes indicative of health disparities prevalent in AAs.,RNA samples from cultured liver hepatocytes were used for RNA-Seq of 6 different drug treatments (Omeprazole， Phenobarbital， Dexamethasone， Carbamazepine， Phenytoin， and Rifampicine),nan,

Defining cardiac functional recovery in end-stage heart failure at single cell resolution,GSE226314,Homo sapiens,Recovery of cardiac function is the ultimate goal of heart failure therapy yet is infrequently observed and remains poorly understood. Here we characterize the cellular landscape and predictors of cardiac recovery by performing single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) from 40 heart failure patients who recovered LV systolic function following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and patients who did not recover and non-diseased donors. We identify cell type specific transcriptional signatures of recovery in all cell types， most prominently in macrophages and fibroblasts. Pro-inflammatory macrophages and inflammatory signalling in fibroblasts were negative predictors of recovery， while downregulation of RUNX1 transcriptional activity in macrophages and fibroblasts was associated with recovery. In silico perturbation of RUNX1 in macrophages and fibroblasts recapitulated the transcriptional state of recovery. In a mouse model of cardiac recovery mediated by BRD4 inhibition， we observed a decrease in macrophage and fibroblast Runx1 expression， diminished chromatin accessibility within a Runx1 intronic peak， and acquisition of human recovery signatures. These findings suggest that cardiac recovery is a unique biological state and identify RUNX1 as a possible therapeutic target to facilitate cardiac recovery.,snRNA-seq in donor and HF (pre-post LVAD split by responders and non-responders),nan,

An RNAi Screen of RNA Helicases Identifies eIF4A3 as a Regulator of Embryonic Stem Cell Identity [Ribo-seq],GSE193940,Mus musculus,RNA helicases are involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism to direct their roles in gene expression， yet their functions in pluripotency control remain largely unexplored. Starting from an RNAi screen of RNA helicases， we identified that eIF4A3， a DEAD-box (Ddx) helicase component of the exon junction complex (EJC)， is essential for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically， we show that eIF4A3 post-transcriptionally controls the pluripotency-related cell cycle regulators and that its depletion causes cellular differentiation via cell cycle dysregulation.  Specifically， eIF4A3 is required for the efficient nuclear export of Ccnb1 mRNA， which encodes Cyclin B1， a key component of the pluripotency-promoting pathway during cell cycle progression of ESCs. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of eIF4A3 and its associated EJC in the post-transcriptional cell cycle control in maintaining stem cell pluripotency.,eIF4A3 transcriptome profiling was investigated via RNA-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells.,36416264,Nucleic Acids Res

Stromal HIF2 Regulated Immune Suppression in the Pancreatic Cancer Microenvironment,GSE193416,Mus musculus,We used a dual recombinase mouse model to delete Hif2a in Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±SMA)-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) arising within spontaneous pancreatic tumors. The effects of CAF-Hif2a expression on tumor progression and composition of the tumor microenvironment were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis， quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction， histology， immunostaining， and by both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. CAF-macrophage crosstalk was modeled ex vivo using conditioned media from CAFs after treatment with hypoxia and PT2399， a HIF2 inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Syngeneic flank and orthotopic PDAC models were used to assess whether HIF2 inhibition improves response to immune checkpoint blockade.Results. CAF-specific deletion of HIF2， but not HIF1， suppressed PDAC tumor progression and growth， and improved survival of mice by 50% (n = 21-23 mice/group， Log-rank P = 0.0009). Deletion of CAF-HIF2 modestly reduced tumor fibrosis and significantly decreased the intratumoral recruitment of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Treatment with the clinical HIF2 inhibitor PT2399 significantly reduced in vitro macrophage chemotaxis and M2 polarization， and improved tumor responses to immunotherapy in both syngeneic PDAC mouse models.Conclusions. Together， these data suggest that stromal HIF2 is an essential component of PDAC pathobiology and is a druggable therapeutic target that could relieve tumor microenvironment immunosuppression and enhance immune responses in this disease.,Examination of Hif2a deletion in aSMA-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts to understand the role of hypoxia-inducible factors within the PDAC tumor microenvironment.

Prolidase deficiency causes spontaneous T cell activation and lupus-like autoimmunity,GSE221410,Mus musculus,Prolidase Deficiency (PD) is a multi-system disorder caused by mutations in the PEPD gene， which encodes a ubiquitously-expressed metallopeptidase essential for the hydrolysis of dipeptides containing C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline. PD typically presents in childhood with developmental delay， skin ulcers， recurrent infections and in some patients， autoimmune features which can mimic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The basis for the autoimmune association is uncertain， but might be due to self-antigen exposure with tissue damage， or indirectly driven by chronic infection and microbial burden. Here we address the question of causation and show that Pepd null mice have increased anti-nuclear autoantibodies and raised serum IgA， accompanied by kidney immune complex deposition， consistent with an SLE-like disease. These features are associated with an accumulation of CD4 and CD8 effector T cells in the spleen and liver. Pepd deficiency leads to spontaneous T cell activation and proliferation into the effector subset， which is cell intrinsic and independent of antigen receptor specificity or antigenic stimulation. However， an increase in KLRG1+ effector CD8 cells is not observed in mixed chimeras， in which the autoimmune phenotype is also absent. Our findings link autoimmune susceptibility in PD to spontaneous T cell dysfunction， likely to be acting in combination with immune activators that lie outside the haemopoietic system but result from the abnormal metabolism or loss of non-enzymatic prolidase function. This knowledge provides insight into the role of prolidase in the maintenance of self-tolerance and highlights the importance of treatment to control T cell activation.,Splenic T cells of 4 replicates of CD45.2+ WT or 4 replicates CD45.2+ Pepd-/- T cells isolated from WT:WT or WT:Pepd-/- mixed chimeric mice were subjected to 3' scRNAseq in combination with ADT T cell markers.

An RNAi Screen of RNA Helicases Identifies eIF4A3 as a Regulator of Embryonic Stem Cell Identity [RNA-Seq],GSE193938,Mus musculus,RNA helicases are involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism to direct their roles in gene expression， yet their functions in pluripotency control remain largely unexplored. Starting from an RNAi screen of RNA helicases， we identified that eIF4A3， a DEAD-box (Ddx) helicase component of the exon junction complex (EJC)， is essential for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically， we show that eIF4A3 post-transcriptionally controls the pluripotency-related cell cycle regulators and that its depletion causes cellular differentiation via cell cycle dysregulation.  Specifically， eIF4A3 is required for the efficient nuclear export of Ccnb1 mRNA， which encodes Cyclin B1， a key component of the pluripotency-promoting pathway during cell cycle progression of ESCs. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of eIF4A3 and its associated EJC in the post-transcriptional cell cycle control in maintaining stem cell pluripotency.,eIF4A3 transcriptome profiling was investigated via RNA-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells.,36416264,Nucleic Acids Res

Comparative functional genomics identifies unique molecular features of EPSCs [RNA-seq],GSE201303,Mus musculus,Extended pluripotent or expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) possess the superior developmental potential to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However， the molecular underpinning of their in vitro maintenance is not well defined. We comparatively studied transcriptome， chromatin accessibility， active histone modification chromatin marks and relative proteomes of ESCs and the two well-established EPSCs to probe the molecular foundation of their unique developmental potential. We found a great overlap in the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles and reliance on pluripotency factors Oct4， Sox2， and Nanog for self-renewal between ESCs and EPSCs. Importantly， we identified a subset of genomic， transcriptomic， and proteomic signatures that distinguish EPSCs from ESCs in transcriptional and translational regulation as well as epigenetic and metabolic control. We also identified molecular differences between the two well-established EPSCs. Our study provides a rich resource for dissecting the regulatory network underlying the developmental potency of EPSCs and exploring alternative states of totipotency.,RNA-seq analysis of mouse extended pluripotent or expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs).,35961778,Life Sci Alliance
A genome-wide relay of signalling-responsive enhancers drives hematopoietic specification (Enhancer Reporter Sequencing),GSE198773,Mus musculus,Developmental control of gene expression critically depends on distal cis-regulatory elements including enhancers which interact with promoters to activate gene expression. Multiple genome-wide studies have mapped chromatin and genomic features of such elements. However， the enhancer definition is operational， and no global experiments have been conducted to date that identify their cell type and cell stage-specific transcription stimulatory activity in a chromatin context. Here， we describe a high-throughput method that identifies thousands of cis-elements capable of stimulating transcriptional activity from a minimal promoter using the blood progenitor differentiation from embryonic stem cells as model. We show that hematopoietic specification and blood cell-specific gene expression are controlled by the concerted action of thousands of differentiation stage-specific sets of cis-elements which respond to cytokine signals terminating at signalling responsive transcription factors. Our work presents a major advance in our understanding of developmental gene expression control in the hematopoietic system and beyond.,Targeted DNA sequencing of fragment libraries cloned into an enhancer reporter cassette in the HPRT locus of HM-1 ES cells and their differentiated progeny.

eIF4A2 targets developmental potency and histone H3.3 transcripts for translational control of embryonic and cancer stemness [Ribo-seq],GSE150676,Mus musculus,Stemness is a defining feature in embryonic and cancer stem cells. How stemness is regulated at the mRNA translational initiation remains undefined. We carried out an RNAi screen for key translation initiation factors that maintain the stemness in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We identified eIF4A2 and defined its mechanistic action through Rps26-depleted and -containing ribosomes in translational initiation activation of mRNAs encoding pluripotency factors and H3.3 for embryonic and extraembryonic lineage repression， respectively. eIF4A2 also mediates translation initiation activation of Ddx6， which acts together with eIF4A2 to restrict the totipotent 2-cell (2C) transcription program in ESCs through Zscan4 mRNA degradation and translation repression. Knockdown of eIF4A2 disrupts ESC proteome causing the loss of stemness in ESCs as well as in human glioblastomas where eIF4A2 is highly enriched. Collectively， our study establishes an eIF4A2-mediated translation initiation control of stemness and provides insight into cancer therapeutics targeting the translation initiation machinery.,eIF4A2 ribosome profiling was investigated via Ribo-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells.,35353581,Sci Adv
Senescence rewires microenvironment sensing to facilitate anti-tumor immunity (scRNA-Seq),GSE223874,Mus musculus,Cellular senescence involves a stable cell cycle arrest coupled to a secretory program that， in some instances， stimulates the immune clearance of senescent cells. Using an immune competent tumor model in which senescence triggers CD8 T cell-mediated tumor rejection， we show that senescence also remodels cell surface proteome to alter how they sense environmental factors， as exemplified by Type II interferon gamma (IFN-Î³). Compared to proliferating cells， senescent cells upregulate IFN-Î³ receptor， become hypersensitized to microenvironmental IFN-Î³， and more robustly induce antigen presenting machinery -effects also recapitulated in human tumor cells treated with senescence-inducing drugs. Disruption of the IFN-Î³ sensing by senescent cells blunts their immune-mediated clearance without disabling their characteristic secretory program or immune cell recruitment. Our results demonstrate that senescent cells have an enhanced ability to both send and receive environmental signals， and imply that each process is required for their effective immune surveillance.,Characterization of single-cell transcriptional profiles of immune cells (CD45+) isolated directly by FACS from p53 off and p53 On (day 8) liver tumor-bearing mice to assess the effects of p53-restoration induced senescence in tumor cells on the immune compartments. 2-3 biological replicates (independent mice) were used per experimental condition.,36302222,Cancer Discov
Multiplex profiling of developmental enhancers with quantitative， single-cell expression reporters [scQer_promoters_cell_lines],GSE217689,Homo sapiens,The inability to scalably and precisely measure the cell-type-specific activity of developmental enhancers is a bottleneck in genomics. To address this， we developed a âdual RNAâ' system that decouples the detection and quantification tasks inherent to multiplex single-cell reporter assays. Together with RNA barcode circularization， the resulting single-cell quantitative expression reporters (scQers) facilitate the robust detection of which reporter(s) are present in which single cells， thereby providing high contrast readouts analogous to classic in situ assays but entirely from sequencing. Our dual RNA strategy extends the range of expression measurement into a regime fundamentally inaccessible with traditional multiplex reporter systems， yielding an accurate readout of mRNA levels spanning four orders of magnitude and a precision approaching the limit set by Poisson (shot) noise. As a proof-of-concept experiment， we profile over two hundred putative developmental cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for cell-type-specific activity in a multicellular in vitro model of early mammalian development， identifying dozens of active elements， ten of which function in an autonomous， cell-type-specific manner. These include constituents of the canonical Sox2 control region， exclusively active in pluripotent cells， multiple parietal endoderm-specific enhancers， including at the Foxa2 and Gata4 loci， and a compact pleiotropic enhancer at the Lamc1 locus. Looking forward， we envision that scQers will be broadly useful in developmental systems to quantitatively profile the activity of native， perturbed， or synthetic enhancers at scale， with high sensitivity and at single cell resolution.,Single-cell reporter on mix of K562， HEK293T， HepG2 cells with high MOI genome-integrated dual RNA reporters (promoter series) in biological duplicates.

The effect of trisomic chromosomes on spatial genome organization and global transcription in embryonic stem cells,GSE179435,Mus musculus,Aneuploidy frequently occurs in cancer and developmental diseases such as Down syndrome， with its functional consequences implicated in dosage effects on gene expression and global perturbation of stress response and cell proliferation pathways. However， how aneuploidy affects spatial genome organization remains less understood. In this study， we addressed this question by utilizing the previously established isogenic wild-type (WT) and trisomic mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We employed a combination of Hi-C， RNA-seq， chromosome painting and nascent RNA imaging technologies to compare the spatial genome structures and gene transcription among these cells. We found that trisomy has little effect on spatial genome organization at the level of A/B compartment or topologically associating domain (TAD). Inter-chromosomal interactions are associated with chromosome regions with high gene density， active histone modifications and high transcription levels， which are confirmed by imaging. Imaging also revealed contracted chromosome volume and weakened transcriptional activity for trisomic chromosomes， suggesting potential implications for the transcriptional output of these chromosomes. Our data resources and findings may contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of aneuploidy from the angle of spatial genome organization.,Analysis of 3D genome architecture and gene expression data for WT mESC and trisomic mESCs with an extra copy of chromosome 6， 8， 11 and 15， respectively (named Ts6， Ts8， Ts11， Ts15).

DNA elements tether canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 to human genes,GSE207401,Homo sapiens,Development of multicellular animals requires epigenetic repression by Polycomb group proteins. The latter assemble in multi-subunit complexes， of which two kinds， Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)， act together to effect the repression of key developmental genes. How PRC1 and PRC2 recognize specific genes remains an open question. Here we report that small adjustment in the next generation sequencing of the Immunoprecipitated Chromatin (ChIP-seq) allows identification of several hundreds of DNA elements that tether canonical PRC1 to human developmental genes. Their analysis indicates that sequence features associated with canonical PRC1 tethering differ from those that favour the retention of PRC2. Throughout the genome， the two kinds of sequence features mix in different proportions to yield a gamut of DNA elements that range from those tethering predominantly PRC1 to ones capable of tethering both PRC1 and PRC2 or the elements that retain exclusively PRC2. The emerging picture is similar to paradigmatic targeting of Polycomb complexes by Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) of Drosophila but providing for unexpected degree of plasticity.,ChIP-seq of the Polycomb group proteins SUZ12， MEL18/BMI1 and RING， and the histone modification H3K27me3， performed on the cell lines NT2-D1， TIG-3， and KBM7-1-55-S2-24 clone F10.

Multimodal epigenetic changes and altered NEUROD1 chromatin binding in the mouse hippocampus underlie FOXG1 syndrome,GSE189110,Mus musculus,As part of our multimodal investigation fo FOXG1 functions at the chromatin， we report that there are both increase and decrease in chromatin accessibility upon reduced levels of FOXG1 in pirmary hippocampal neurons. The data presented in this study enlighten for the first time in a comprehensive manner diverse and multi-modal functions of FOXG1 at the chromatin level in mature neurons. Despite FOXG1 being recognized as a key transcription factor for telencephalic development and neuronal function， insights into the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation are sparse. We here show that (i) FOXG1 acts both as repressor and activator， (ii) localizes predominantly to enhancer regions， (iii) alters the epigenetic landscape， (iv) affects directly HDAC functions， and (v) acts in concert with NEUROD1 to instruct transcriptional programs necessary for axono- and synaptogenesis.,ATAC-seq was performed in DIV11 hippocampal neurons from E18.5 mice.

We also included Shutdown (AAEL011632)， which is required for the biogenesis of all piRNA populations in D. melanogaster. After knockdown of target genes， RNA was isolated and prepared for small RNA-seq sequencing. dsLuc-1-3 serve as control knockdown for Nxf1 and UAP56， whereas dsLuc4-5 serve as control for knockdown of Vreteno， Tejas， Yb， and Shutdown.,39863754,Commun Biol
Induction of CtsR-regulated chaperones improves Xylanase production in Bacillus subtilis,GSE217916,Bacillus subtilis,We examined the effect of high-level expression of the commercially important endo-1，4-Î²-xylanase XynA on the B. subtilis transcriptome using RNA-seq. Rather unexpectedly， we found a reduced expression of several protein chaperones， including ClpC， ClpE and ClpX， was downregulated when XynA was overproduced. Expression of these proteins is controlled by the transcriptional repressor CtsR. CtsR levels are directly controlled by regulated proteolysis， involving ClpC and its cognate protease ClpP. Preventing this downregulation by knocking out the involved transcriptional repressor CtsR resulted in increased XynA production by more than 25 %.,We used B. subtilis 168 derivative BSB1， which is prototrophic for tryptophan， and removed the native xynA gene through a marker-free clean deletion procedure. This was to assure that the negative control strain does not produce any XynA. Overexpression of XynA was achieved by cloning xynA in the multicopy expression plasmid pUB110 behind the strong amyQ promoter. As a negative control， we used the same plasmid lacking the xynA gene. The strains were grown in nutrient-rich LB medium at 37 Â°C in the presence of 50 Î¼g/ml kanamycin to maintain the plasmids. We sampled cells at 3 h (OD~0.8) and 6h growth (OD~4) and performed RNA-seq. We compared the transcriptomes between XynA overproducing cells and non-producing cells. Two independent biological replicates were performed.,37946188,Microb Cell Fact

Single-cell analysis of human iPSC-derived multi-lineage mini-cardiac organoid reveals molecular pathways to promote cardiomyocyte maturation and heart repair,GSE166462,Homo sapiens,Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiovascular cells are promising cell source for cell therapy to repair the heart. Cardiac microtissue consisted of cardiomyocytes and fibroblast cells exhibited much better physiological functions. How different cardiovascular cell types interact and evolve in 3D microenvironment is unknown. In this study， we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of hiPSC-derived mini-cardiac organoid consisted of cardiomyocytes， endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Our analysis showed that cardiac fibroblasts emerged spontaneously in 3D microenvironment which in turn facilitated the maturation of cardiomyocytes. HiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes， endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells assembled into mini-cardiac organoid in collagen-matrigel after 2 weeks. Single-cell study uncovered significant cell fate shift and improvement in cardiomyocyte maturation status upon-multilineage co-culture. Ligand-receptor analysis identified DLK1-Notch signaling to be one of the most upregulated pathways in the fibroblast population. Modulate the activity of DLK1-Notch signaling affected the assembly of the mini-cardiac organoid and the expression of immune regulatory genes. Interestingly， transplantation of trilineage mini-cardiac organoid into a rat model of myocardial infarction leads to significant improvement of cardiac function. Collectively， our single-cell analysis of mini-cardiac organoid provided rich information about cell fate dynamics and multilineage cross-talks occurred in the 3D microenvironment， which bring new insight on the molecular mechanism that promotes cardiomyocyte maturation and heart repair.,single cell RNA-seq of hiPSC-derived human cardiomyocytes， endothelial cells， smooth muscle cells and mini-cardiac organoid,39871934,Life Med

Case Report: Deep Immune Profiling Links Neutrophil and Plasmablast Dysregulation to Microvascular Damage in post-COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome of Adults (MIS-A).,GSE171052,Homo sapiens,Despite surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection， some individuals experience an intense post-infectious Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) of uncertain etiology. Children with this syndrome (MIS-C) can experience a Kawasaki-like disease， but mechanisms in adults (MIS-A) are not clearly defined. Here we utilize a deep phenotyping approach to examine immunologic responses in an individual with MIS-A. Results are contextualized to healthy， convalescent， and acute COVID-19 patients. The findings reveal systemic inflammatory changes involving novel neutrophil and B-cell subsets， autoantibodies， complement， and hypercoagulability that are linked to systemic vascular dysfunction. This deep patient profiling generates new mechanistic insight into this rare clinical entity and provides potential insight into other post-infectious syndromes.,Single-cell RNA-Seq library construction， alignment， and quality control:A total of 15，000 single cells (containing an equal proportion of leukocytes and lymphocytes) were loaded for partitioning using 10X Genomics NextGEM Gel Bead emulsions. All samples were processed as per manufacturerâs protocol (with both PCR amplification steps run 12X). Quality control and pre-loading cDNA quantification was performed using TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape assay. Sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq S2 and SP 100 cycle dual lane flow cells over multiple rounds to ensure each sample received approximately 32，000 reads per cell. Sequencing reads were aligned using CellRanger 3.1.0 pipeline to the standard pre-built GRCh38 reference genome. Samples that passed alignment QC were aggregated into single datasets using CellRanger aggr with between-sample normalization to ensure each sample received an equal number of mapped reads per cell. Aggregated healthy (n = 3) and recovered COVID-19 (n = 3) samples recovered 30，514 cells that were sequenced to 17，157 post-normalization reads per cell.Single-cell RNA-Seq computational analyses and workflows:Filtered feature-barcode HDF5 matrices from aggregated datasets were imported into the R package Seurat v.3.9 for normalization， scaling， integration， multi-modal reference mapping， louvain clustering， dimensionality reduction， differential expression analysis， and visualization. Briefly， cells with abnormal transcriptional complexity (fewer than 500 UMIs， greater than 25，000 UMIs， or greater than 15% of mitochondrial reads) were considered artifacts and were removed from subsequent analysis. Cell identity was classified by mapping single cell profiles to the recently published PBMC single-cell joint RNA/CITE-Seq multi-omic AZIMUTH reference. Since no published reference automates granulocyte annotations， neutrophil clusters were manually annotated by querying known markers (i.e. CSF3R， S100A8， S100A9， MMP8， MMP9， ELANE， MPO). A cell state-specific âperturbation scoreâ was calculated to reflect the magnitude of response elicited by factoring in number and cumulative FC of consensus DEGs. Perturbation scores were visualized using Nebulosa-generated density plots. Cells with high mitochondrial read were subsetted to enable further characterization of these cells， as there were high mitochondrial reads specifically in the first MIS-A sample.,36911724,Front Immunol

SETD5 haploinsufficiency affects mitochondrial compartment in neural cells,GSE222188,Mus musculus,Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are heterogeneous conditions due to alterations of a variety of molecular mechanisms and cell dysfunctions. Epigenetic basis of NDDs have been reported in an increasingly number of cases while mitochondrial dysfunctions are more common within NDD patients than in the general population. Here， we investigated experimental models of Setd5 haploinsufficiency， that leads to NDDs in humans due to chromatin defects， and uncovered that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the pathogenesis. Mitochondrial impairment is facilitated by transcriptional aberrations that follow the decrease of SETD5 enzyme. Low levels of SETD5 resulted in fragmented mitochondria， less mitochondrial potential and ATP production both in neural precursors and neurons. Mitochondria were miss-localized in mutant neurons， with few organelles within neurites and synapses. Our study explores the epigenetics/mitochondria interplay as an important aspect of NDD pathophysiology and defines the impairments of mitochondrial functionality and dynamics as new therapeutic targets for disorders associated with loss of SETD5.,RNA-seq of mouse Neural precursors cells cultured in High Oxygen condition,37264456,Mol Autism

Hypoxic niches attract and sequester tumor-associated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells and reprogram them for immunosuppression.,GSE179077,Mus musculus,Glioblastoma (GBM)， a highly lethal brain cancer， is notorious for immunosuppression， but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here， we documented a temporospatial patterning of tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs) corresponding to vascular changes during GBM progression. As tumor vessels transitioned from the initial dense regular network to later scant and engorged vasculature， TAMs shifted away from perivascular regions and trafficked to vascular-poor areas. This process was heavily influenced by the immunocompetence state of the host. Utilizing a sensitive fluorescent UnaG reporter to track tumor hypoxia， coupled with single-cell transcriptomics， we revealed that hypoxic niches attracted and sequestered TAMs and cytotoxic T lympho- cytes (CTLs)， where they were reprogrammed toward an immunosuppressive state. Mechanistically， we identified chemokine CCL8 and cytokine IL-1b as two hypoxic-niche factors critical for TAM trafficking and co-evolution of hypoxic zones into pseudopalisading patterns. Therefore， perturbation of TAM patterning in hypoxic zones may improve tumor control.,Single cell sequencing of mouse brain carrying GL261 intracranial GBM transplant engineered with HIF reporter HRE-UnaG.**Please note that the records have been updated on June 12， 2024 as the previous files and information were incorrect***,37451265,Immunity
Lifelong tissue memory relies on spatially organized dedicated progenitors located distally from the injury [scRNAseq_gradient],GSE221405,Mus musculus,It is believed epithelial cells that have participated in a wound repair elicit a more efficient but locally Â restricted response to future injuries. However here we show that the cell adaptation resulting from a localised tissue damage has a wide spatial impact at a scale not previously noticed. We demonstrate that away from injured site， after a first injury a specific epithelial stem cell population gives rise to long term wound-memory progenitors residing in their own niche of origin. Notably these progenitors have not taken part in the first wound healing but become pre-activated through priming. This adaptation differs from classical features of trained immunity previously shown to be adopted by other epithelial stem cells. Our newly identified wound-distal memory cells display an intrinsic pre-activated state， maintained at chromatin and transcriptional level， leading to an enhanced wound repair ability that can be partially recapitulated through epigenetic perturbation even in absence of an injury. Importantly， the harmful consequences of wound repair， such as exacerbated tumorigenesis， occur within these primed cells and follow their spatial distribution. Overall， we show that sub-organ scale adaptation of an injury relies on spatially organized and memory-dedicated progenitors， characterized by a chromatin actionable cell state， that establishes an epigenetic field cancerization and predisposes to tumour onset.,Lrig1 GL cells were  isolated  from tail epidermis at 8w pw1  time point.

Epigenetic dosage identifies two major and functionally distinct Î² cell subtypes [scRNA-seq],GSE225436,Mus musculus,The mechanisms that specify and stabilize cell subtypes remain poorly understood. Here， we identify two major subtypes of pancreatic Î² cells based on histone mark heterogeneity (Î²HI and Î²LO). Î²HI cells exhibit â¼4-fold higher levels of H3K27me3， distinct chromatin organization and compaction， and a specific transcriptional pattern. Î²HI and Î²LO cells also differ in size， morphology， cytosolic and nuclear ultrastructure， epigenomes， cell surface marker expression， and function， and can be FACS separated into CD24+ and CD24â fractions. Functionally， Î²HI cells have increased mitochondrial mass， activity， and insulin secretion in vivo and ex vivo. Partial loss of function indicates that H3K27me3 dosage regulates Î²HI/Î²LO ratio in vivo， suggesting that control of Î² cell subtype identity and ratio is at least partially uncoupled. Both subtypes are conserved in humans， with Î²HI cells enriched in humans with type 2 diabetes. Thus， epigenetic dosage is a novel regulator of cell subtype specification and identifies two functionally distinct Î² cell subtypes.,ChIP-seq on pancreatic Î²-cell,36948185,Cell Metab

RNA helicase DHX15 exemplifies a unique dependency in acute leukemia,GSE208746,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as essential regulators to control gene expression and modulate multiple cancer traits. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy derived from transformation of T-cell progenitors that normally undergo discrete steps of differentiation in the thymus. Yet implications of essential RBPs during T cell neoplastic transformation remain largely unexplored. Systematic evaluation of RBPs identifies the RNA helicase DHX15， a key subunit in the intron lariat spliceosome (ILS) complex， as a potential T-ALL dependency factor. Using cell-based functional assays and the NOTCH1-induced murine T-ALL model， we demonstrate the essential importance of DHX15 in tumor cell survival and leukemogenesis. Moreover， single-cell transcriptomics reveals that DHX15 depletion in T-cell progenitors impairs normal T-cell development and， more specifically， hinders burst proliferation during CD4-CD8-(DN)-to-CD4+CD8+(DP) transition. Mechanistically， abrogation of DHX15 induces altered RNA splicing and downregulation of SLC7A6 and SLC38A5， thereby suppressing glutamine import and mTORC1 activity. Sustained mTORC1 hyperactivation significantly rescues the DHX15-deficient phenotypes， supporting mTORC1 as a prominent downstream effector mediating the pro-proliferative role of DHX15. Moreover， we propose a DHX15 signature modulator drug ciclopirox and demonstrate the prominent anti-T-ALL efficacy. We therefore highlight DHX15 as a crucial regulator during T-cell leukemogenesis， and provide mechanistic insights that DHX15， although functioning at the end of splicing catalysis， modulates a subset of pathogenic mis-splicing events. These findings exemplify a promising therapeutic approach that splicing perturbation by targeting DHX15 may achieve robust anti-tumor efficacy.,We used human T-ALL as a model system， and performed multi-omics analysis including RNA-seq and RIP-seq to study the regulatory mechanism of RNA-helicase DHX15. Meanwhile， to further clarify the heterogeneities of thymocyte subsets and the abnormal gene expression profiles in the absence of Dhx15， we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using 10X Genomics platform on isolated single cells from thymus with or without Dhx15 expression,nan,
Single-cell gene expression profiling of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells following CRISPR activation of ferroptosis regulators,GSE210762,Homo sapiens,Understanding the operational molecular， and metabolic networks that determine the balance between pro- and anti-ferroptotic regulatory pathways could unravel unique vulnerabilities to be exploited for cancer therapy. Using genome-wide and single-cell CRISPR activation screens， we identify the selenoprotein P (SELENOP) receptor， LRP8， as a key determinant protecting MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells from ferroptosis in vitro and in orthotopic neuroblastoma mouse models. Specifically， the exquisite dependency on LRP8-mediated selenocysteine import is caused by the failure of MYCN-amplified cells to efficiently utilize alternative forms of selenium/selenocysteine based uptake necessary for selenoprotein biosynthesis. Increased activity of one of such transporters， SLC7A11， in MYCN-amplified cells leads to cysteine overload， progressive mitochondrial decline and impaired proliferation. These data reveal in LRP8 a targetable， and specific vulnerability of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells and disclose a yet-unaccounted mechanism for selective ferroptosis induction that has the potential to become an important therapeutic entry point for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.,The CROP-seq experiment was performed in human SK-N-DZ cells stably expressing dCas9-VP64 and p65-HSF1. Cells were transduced with a library of CRISPR activation gRNAs targeting 36 hits derived from the primary ferroptosis resistance screens with two independent gRNAs. After puromycin selection and recovery， two lanes  of the 10X platform were used to partition individual cells into gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) and single-cell libraries were constructed.,37435859,EMBO Mol Med

Clonal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in children and adults with COVID-19,GSE196456,Homo sapiens,Children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop less severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than adults. The mechanisms for the age-specific differences and the implications for infection-induced immunity are beginning to be uncovered. We show by longitudinal multimodal analysis that SARS-CoV-2 leaves a small footprint in the circulating T cell compartment in children with mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 compared to adult household contacts with the same disease severity who had more evidence of systemic T cell interferon activation， cytotoxicity and exhaustion. Children harbored diverse polyclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific naive T cells whereas adults harbored clonally expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells. More naive interferon-activated CD4+ T cells were recruited into the memory compartment and recovery was associated with the development of robust CD4+ memory T cell responses in adults but not children. These data suggest that rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in children may compromise their cellular immunity and ability to resist reinfection.,scRNA seq of 28 samples， 7 children， 5 adults and 2 ICU adults samples collected at acute and convalescent stage.,36539107,Clin Immunol

Prolidase deficiency causes spontaneous T cell activation and lupus-like autoimmunity,GSE221569,Mus musculus,Prolidase Deficiency (PD) is a multi-system disorder caused by mutations in the PEPD gene， which encodes a ubiquitously-expressed metallopeptidase essential for the hydrolysis of dipeptides containing C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline. PD typically presents in childhood with developmental delay， skin ulcers， recurrent infections and in some patients， autoimmune features which can mimic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The basis for the autoimmune association is uncertain， but might be due to self-antigen exposure with tissue damage， or indirectly driven by chronic infection and microbial burden. Here we address the question of causation and show that Pepd null mice have increased anti-nuclear autoantibodies and raised serum IgA， accompanied by kidney immune complex deposition， consistent with an SLE-like disease. These features are associated with an accumulation of CD4 and CD8 effector T cells in the spleen and liver. Pepd deficiency leads to spontaneous T cell activation and proliferation into the effector subset， which is cell intrinsic and independent of antigen receptor specificity or antigenic stimulation. However， an increase in KLRG1+ effector CD8 cells is not observed in mixed chimeras， in which the autoimmune phenotype is also absent. Our findings link autoimmune susceptibility in PD to spontaneous T cell dysfunction， likely to be acting in combination with immune activators that lie outside the haemopoietic system but result from the abnormal metabolism or loss of non-enzymatic prolidase function. This knowledge provides insight into the role of prolidase in the maintenance of self-tolerance and highlights the importance of treatment to control T cell activation.,Splenic T cells from 3 WT or 3 Pepd-/- mice were subjected to 3' scRNAseq in combination with ADT T cell markers.

Contribution of variant subunits and associated factors to genome-wide distribution and dynamics of cohesin [ChIP-seq],GSE212150,Mus musculus,The cohesin complex organizes the genome forming dynamic chromatin loops that impact on all DNA-mediates processes. There are two different cohesin complexes in vertebrate somatic cells， carrying the STAG1 or STAG2 subunit， and two versions of the regulatory subunit PDS5， PDS5A and PDS5B. Mice deficient for any of the variant subunits are embryonic lethal， which indicates that they are not functionally redundant. However， their specific behavior at the molecular level is not fully understood. The genome-wide distribution of cohesin provides important information with functional consequences. Here， we have characterized the distribution of cohesin subunits and regulators in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) either wild type or deficient for cohesin subunits and regulators by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. We identify non-CTCF cohesin binding sites in addition to the commonly detected CTCF cohesin sites and show that cohesin-STAG2 is the preferred variant at these positions. Moreover， this complex has a more dynamic association with chromatin as judged by fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)， associates preferentially with WAPL and is more easily extracted from chromatin with salt than cohesin-STAG1. We observe that both PDS5A and PDS5B are exclusively located at cohesin-CTCF positions， that ablation of a single paralog has no noticeable consequences for cohesin distribution， while double knocked out cells show decreased accumulation of cohesin at all its binding sites. With the exception of a fraction of cohesin positions in which we find binding of all regulators-including CTCF and WAPL-， the presence of NIPBL and PDS5 is mutually exclusive， consistent with results of immunoprecipitation reactions in mammalian cells， as suggested previously from results in vitro. Our findings support the idea that non-CTCF cohesin binding sites represent sites of cohesin loading or pausing and are preferentially occupied by the more dynamic cohesin-STAG2. PDS5 proteins redundantly contribute to arrest cohesin at CTCF sites， possibly by preventing binding of NIPBL， but are not essential for this arrest. These results add important insights towards understanding how cohesin regulates genome folding and the specific contributions of the different variants that coexist in the cell.,ChIP-seq for cohesin subunits (SMC1A， STAG1 and STAG2) was performed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts either wild type or deficient for cohesin subunits cohesin regulators. For the different genotypes， each replicate corresponds to MEF extracted from a different embryo. Input samples are an equimolar mix of chromatin from the two clones. WT clones for each condition come from littermates in the case of constitutive KOs (Pds5A KO， Pds5B KO， Stag1 KO) or from the same clone without exposure to Cre (Pds5 DKO， Stag2 KO， Ctcf KO).,36424654,Epigenetics Chromatin

The wheat C2H2 zinc finger protein TaZFP13D modulates the expression of chloroplast-related genes， improves growth and drought stress tolerance.,GSE226842,Triticum aestivum,Background  Maintaining global food security in the context of climate changes is an important challenge in the next century. Improving abiotic stress tolerance of major crops， like wheat， can contribute to this goal. Therefore， new genes improving tolerance to abiotic stresses， like drought， are needed to support breeding programs aimed at producing more adapted cultivars. Recently， we screened five wheat Zinc Finger Proteins (TaZFPs) and identified TaZFP13D as a new gene improving water-stress tolerance. However， a more detailed characterization of this gene is required to better evaluate its potential in drought tolerance and to decipher the underlying molecular basis.    Results  We used the Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus to up- or down-regulate TaZFP13D expression in wheat. Overexpression of TaZFP13D under well-watered conditions enhances growth as indicated by improved biomass. Exposing plants to a severe drought stress revealed that TaZFP13D strongly increases survival rate and stress recovery. In addition， TaZFP13D reduces drought-induced oxidative damages， at least in part by improving key antioxidant enzymes activity. Conversely， down-regulation of TaZFP13D decreases drought tolerance and protection against drought-induced oxidative damages. RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis showed that many genes regulated by TaZFP13D were previously shown to improve drought tolerance， while many others are related to the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and are proposed to improve photosynthesis efficiency and chloroplast protection against ROS damages.    Conclusion  This study highlights the important role of TaZFP13D in wheat drought tolerance， contributes to unravel the complex regulation governed by TaZFPs， and provides a useful marker to select more drought tolerant wheat cultivars.,Examination of wheat second leaf transcript profiles modification in 4 wheat plant types under well watered condition and drought condition.,38332456,Plant Mol Biol

The mRNA levels of CYP2A1， CYP2C11， CYP2C13， CYP2D， CYP2E1， and CYP3A of CYP family members were significantly downregulated in antibiotics-treated rats.,mRNA profiles of liver and jejunum of wild-type rats and antibiotics-treated rats were generated by RNA-seq， in triplicate， by Illumina NovaSeq 6000.,36623881,Drug Metab Dispos
Wheat transcriptomic responses to long-term feeding by wheat curl mites,GSE195958,Triticum aestivum,The economic importance of wheat and its contribution to human and livestock diets has been already demonstrated. However， wheat production is impacted by pests that induce yield reductions. Among these pests， wheat curl mite (WCM， Aceria tosichella Keifer) impacts wheat all around the world. WCM are tiny pests that feed within the whorl of developing leaves and prevent the leaves from unfurling by causing leaves curling. The curling of the leaves provides a protective niche for the WCM. Additionally， WCM are also the vector of serious viruses in wheat. Little is known regarding the impact of the WCM on wheat transcriptome， and to date， only one article has been published describing the wheat transcriptomic changes after 1 day of WCM feeding. To better understand the wheat transcriptome variation after long-term feeding by WCM (10 days post infestation (dpi))， we used an RNA-seq approach. We collected leaves uninfested and infested with WCR from two wheat cultivars: Byrd (WCM resistant) and Settler CL (WCM susceptible) at 10 dpi. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed the common and specific transcriptomic variations in WCM resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars， chromosome specific location of the differentially expressed genes， and also identified the gene functions and pathways involved in WCM resistance. Collectively， our study provides important insights on wheat defense mechanisms against WCM after long-term feeding.,Whorl mRNA profiles of 10 days after infestation of resistant (Byrd) and susceptible (Settler CL) wheat cultivar,nan,
Single Cell Multiome of isogenic HIV-1-infected Jurkat T cells,GSE229928,Homo sapiens,HIV-1 integration introduces ectopic transcription factor binding sites into host chromatin. We postulate that the integrated provirus serves as an ectopic enhancer that recruits additional transcriptional factors to the integration locus， increases chromatin accessibility， changes 3D chromatin interactions， and enhances both retroviral and host gene expression. We used 4 well-characterized HIV-1-infected cell line clones having unique integration sites and low to high levels of HIV-1 expression. Using single-cell DOGMA-seq， which captured the heterogeneity of HIV-1 expression and host chromatin accessibility， we found that HIV-1 transcription correlated with HIV-1 accessibility and host chromatin accessibility. HIV-1 integration increased local host chromatin accessibility within ~5â30 kb distance. CRISPRa and CRISPRi-mediated HIV-1 promoter activation and inhibition confirmed integration site-dependent HIV-1-driven changes of host chromatin accessibility. HIV-1 did not drive chromatin confirmation changes at the genomic level (by Hi-C) or the enhancer connectome (by H3K27Ac HiChIP). Using 4C-seq to interrogate HIV-1-chromatin interactions， we found that HIV-1 interacted with host chromatin ~100â300 kb from the integration site. By identifying chromatin regions having both increased transcription factor activity (by ATAC-seq) and HIV-1-chromtain interaction (by 4C-seq)， we identified enrichment of ETS， RUNT， STAT， and ZNF transcription factor binding that may mediate HIV-1-host chromatin interactions. Our study found that HIV-1 promoter activity increased host chromatin accessibility， increased HIV-1-host chromatin interactions in an integration site dependent manner， within the existing chromatin boundaries without impacting broader host chromatin structure.,Unstimulated Jurkat CD4+ T cells with or without an HIV-1 provirus were profiled.,nan,
Rpb9 plays a critical role in global co-transcriptional splicing in mouse ESC (Fraction chrRNA-seq),GSE175670,Mus musculus,To define the function of Rpb9 on co-transcriptional splicing， we used auxin-inducible Rpb9 degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with auxin treatment for 3 hours to sufficiently deplete Rpb9. To measure co-transcriptional splicing， we fractionated mESCs cells (spiked in with Drosophila S2 cells for data normalization) into cytosolic (Cyt)， nucleoplasm (NP)， and chromatin/particle (Chr) fractions. We purified total RNA from Chr compartment， depleted ribosomal RNAs， and constructed two independent libraries for RNA-seq， which showed excellent reproducibility.,Characterization of co-transcriptional splicing after degradating Rpb9 in mESC cells,nan,
Chromatin opening by p53 is confined by Trim24 in a histone methylation-dependent manner [ATAC-seq],GSE200582,Mus musculus,Chromatin modifications are thought to provide additional context dependence for sequence-based gene activation. Binding sites of the transcription factor (TF) and important tumor suppressor p53 are unusually diverse with regards to their chromatin accessibility and histone modifications， suggesting different modes of binding. Here， we show that the ability of p53 to open chromatin and activate its target genes upon DNA damage is locally restricted by its cofactor Trim24. The histone-binding domains of Trim24 limit the role of p53 at closed chromatin but not at accessible chromatin where Trim24 is blocked by histone 3 methylation at lysine 4. In turn p53 regulates gene expression as a function of the naÃ¯ve chromatin state prior to activation.   These findings establish a set of p53 response genes in closed chromatin that are Trim24-regulated and illustrate how histone modification sensing cofactors bridge local chromatin state and TF potency.,Examination of p53 and Trim24 function in cell lines including mouse embryonic stem cells.

Dependency of NELF-E-SLUG-KAT2B epigenetic axis in breast cancer carcinogenesis,GSE195761,Homo sapiens,Cancer cells undergo transcriptional reprogramming to drive tumorigenesis and caner progression. Here， we identified the transcriptional complex， NELF (Negative elongation factor)， as an important regulator of this process. Using cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor organoids， we demonstrated that loss of NELF inhibits breast cancer. Specifically， we found that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness-associated genes are downregulated in NELF-depleted breast cancer cells. Afterwards， we pinpointed that SLUG， a key EMT transcription factor， was a top hit of NELF interactome during EMT progression. Furthermore， ChIP-seq analysis revealed that loss of NELF led to impaired SLUG binding on chromatin. Through integrative transcriptomic and genomic analyses， we identified the histone acetyltransferase， KAT2B， as a key functional target of NELF-E-SLUG. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of KAT2B ameliorate expression of critical EMT marker genes， phenocopying NELF ablation. Elevated NELF-E and KAT2B expressions are associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients， highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. Taken together， we uncovered a crucial role of the NELF-E-KAT2B epigenetic axis in breast cancer carcinogenesis.,RNA-seq of CRISPR/CAS9-mediated NELF-E KO MCF7， BT549 and SUM159 cell lines and their parental wildtype lines， NELF-E/scrambled shRNA transduced MCF7ras+SS cells and KAT2B/scrambled siRNA transfected MCF7ras+SS cells with the induction of Doxycycline or DMSO vehicle， Doxycycline-induced MCF7ras+SS cells treated with Garcinol (GA) or DMSO vehicle.

Epigenetic dosage identifies two major and functionally distinct Î² cell subtypes [ChIP-seq],GSE224060,Mus musculus,The mechanisms that specify and stabilize cell subtypes remain poorly understood. Here， we identify two major subtypes of pancreatic Î² cells based on histone mark heterogeneity (Î²HI and Î²LO). Î²HI cells exhibit â¼4-fold higher levels of H3K27me3， distinct chromatin organization and compaction， and a specific transcriptional pattern. Î²HI and Î²LO cells also differ in size， morphology， cytosolic and nuclear ultrastructure， epigenomes， cell surface marker expression， and function， and can be FACS separated into CD24+ and CD24â fractions. Functionally， Î²HI cells have increased mitochondrial mass， activity， and insulin secretion in vivo and ex vivo. Partial loss of function indicates that H3K27me3 dosage regulates Î²HI/Î²LO ratio in vivo， suggesting that control of Î² cell subtype identity and ratio is at least partially uncoupled. Both subtypes are conserved in humans， with Î²HI cells enriched in humans with type 2 diabetes. Thus， epigenetic dosage is a novel regulator of cell subtype specification and identifies two functionally distinct Î² cell subtypes.,H3K27me3 ChIP-seq on FACS sorted pancreatic beta-HI/-LO Î²-cell,36948185,Cell Metab
Microbiota dysbiosis associated with type 2 diabetes-like effects caused by chronic exposure to a mixture of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants in zebrafish [I],GSE233631,Danio rerio,Mixtures of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants (C-POPs-Mix) are chemically related risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however， the effects of chronic exposure to C-POPs-Mix on microbial dysbiosis remain poorly understood. Herein， male and female zebrafish were exposed to C-POPs-Mix at a 1:1 ratio of five organochlorine pesticides and Aroclor 1254 at concentrations of 0.02， 0.1， and 0.5 Î¼g/L for 12 weeks. We measured T2DM indicators in blood and profiled microbial abundance， richness， and evenness in the gut as well as transcriptomic and metabolomic alterations in the liver. Exposure to C-POPs-Mix significantly increased blood glucose levels while decreasing the abundance and alpha diversity of microbial communities only in females at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.1 Î¼g/L. The majorly identified microbial contributors to microbial dysbiosis were Bosea minatitlanensis， Rhizobium tibeticum， Bifidobacterium catenulatum， B. adolescentis， and Collinsella aerofaciens. PICRUSt results suggested that altered pathways were associated with glucose and lipid production and inflammation， which are linked to changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of the zebrafish liver. Metagenomics outcomes revealed close relationships between intestinal and liver disruptions to T2DM-related molecular pathways. Thus， microbial dysbiosis in T2DM-triggered zebrafish occurred as a result of chronic exposure to C-POPs-Mix， indicating strong hostâmicrobiome interactions.,Samples consisted of the control group and three treatment groups exposed to 0.02， 0.1， and 0.5 ug/L of C-POPs-Mix (containing five OCPs and Aroclor1254) for the mechanistic study to demonstrate the relationship between microbiota dysbiosis and type 2 diabetes in C-POPs-Mix exposed zebrafish. Six female livers were pooled for each group and used to perform RNA-seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. For 16S rRNA-seq analysis， total genomic DNAs were individually extracted from five intestines in each group and sequenced by Illumina Miseq system.,nan,

Structural and functional properties of mSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes revealed through single-cell perturbation and genomic profiling,GSE200201,Homo sapiens,Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression and are comprised of three final-form assemblies， cBAF， PBAF， and ncBAF， which exhibit distinct modular organization， chromatin targeting， and roles in disease. However， the contributions of each subcomplex and their constituent subunits to gene expression remain incompletely defined. Here， we performed a large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen targeting mSWI/SNF subunits individually and in selected combinations， followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (Perturb-seq) and SHARE-Seq. We uncover complex- and module-specific contributions across cell regulatory pathways， define paralog subunit relationships， and identify shifted functions upon perturbations. Finally， we superimpose single-cell perturbation signatures over bulk primary human tumor gene expression profiles， defining unique subunit-specific signatures and identifying tumor features that mirror BAF loss-of-function. Taken together， these data highlight the utility of large-scale single-cell genomics to uncover gene expression and chromatin accessibility signatures in human disease states.,1. Perturb-seq experiments: To map the roles of different subunits of the mSWI/SNF complex， we performed Perturb-seq on MOLM13 cells， following either individual perturbation of subunits (âsingleâ experiment) or combinatorial perturbation of selected subunit combinations (âcomboâ experiment). Cells were profiled with the 10X Chromium Single Cell 3â RNA-seq v3 kit， with 6000 cells loaded per channel. The âsingleâ and âcomboâ experiments were profiled with 15 and 3 channels， respectively， and were sequenced paired-end on an Illumina Hi-Seq instrument at a ratio of 3 channels of 10x to 1 lane of sequencing (5 for the âsingleâ experiment， and 1 for the âcomboâ experiment)， using paired end reads as follows.     For the âsingleâ experiment， read 1 is 28 bases long (16 for cell barcode， 12 for UMI)， read 2 is 91 bases long and sample index read is 8 bases long.     For the âcomboâ experiment， read 1 is 28 bases long (16 for cell barcode， 12 for UMI)， read 2 is 91 bases long and sample index read is 8 bases long.     Perturbations were assigned to cells using dial-out PCR. Dial-out PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina Mi-seq， paired-end (for all experiments， read 1 is 28 bases and read 2 is 60 bases long)， with read 1 having the same structure as in the high-throughput sequencing of the libraries described above. Each experiment required only one Mi-Seq run to process the dial-out libraries.     2. SHARE-seq experiment: To map the changes in accessibility and gene regulation controlled by mSWI/SNF complexes， we performed SHARE-seq on MOLM13 cells following CRISPR-mediated knockout of specific mSWI/SNF subunits， obtaining both RNA-seq and ATAC-seq readouts in the same single cell. RNA and ATAC libraries were sequenced using a 150 cycle high output Illumina kit on a NextSeq500 (Illumina) instrument. We performed SHARE-seq for 5 conditions: control guide， ARID1A， SMARCD2， SMARCA4 and BRD9， each with 2 replicate wells in an arrayed format. All cells from the SHARE-seq experiment were sequenced together in the same library， and can be demultiplexed by their well index (see Methods).,37028419,Mol Cell

Comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution,GSE228415,Homo sapiens,Inference of cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA-sequencing data is a powerful technique to uncover intercellular communication pathways， yet existing methods perform this analysis at the level of the cell type or cluster， discarding single-cell level information. Here we present Scriabin， a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell resolution that is performed without cell aggregation or downsampling. We use multiple published atlas-scale datasets， genetic perturbation screens， and direct experimental validation to show that Scriabin accurately recovers expected cell-cell communication edges and identifies communication networks that can be obscured by agglomerative methods. Additionally， we use spatial transcriptomic data to show that Scriabin can uncover spatial features of interaction from dissociated data alone. Finally， we demonstrate applications to longitudinal datasets to follow communication pathways operating between timepoints. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to reveal the full structure of niche-phenotype relationships in health and disease.,Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a single donor.

Escape From Oncogene-Induced Senescence is Controlled by POU2F2 and Memorized by Chromatin Scars [ATAC-seq],GSE206402,Homo sapiens,AlthoughÂ oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a potent tumor-suppressor mechanism， recent studies revealed that cells can escape from OIS with features of transformed cells. However， the mechanisms that promote OIS escape remain unclear， and evidence of post-senescent cells in human cancers is missing. Here， we unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying OIS escape using dynamic multidimensional profiling. We demonstrate a critical role for AP1 and POU2F2 transcription factors for escape from OIS and identify âsenescence-associated chromatin scarsÂ (SACS)â as an epigenetic memory of OIS， detectable during colorectal cancer progression. POU2F2 levels are elevated already inÂ precancerous lesions and as cells escape from OIS， and its expression and binding activity to cis-regulatory elements are associated with decreased patient survival. Our results support a model in which POU2F2 exploits a precoded enhancer landscape to promote senescence escape and reveal POU2F2 gene signatures and SACS as valuable biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic potential.,Timeseries Assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) in GM21 human skin fibroblasts entering and exiting RAS-induced oncogene-induced senescence,37082139,Cell Genom
Distinct SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes act differentially to maintain stem-like exhausted CD8 T cells [ATAC-seq],GSE211409,Mus musculus,Exhausted CD8 T cells (TEX) arise during chronic viral infections and cancer and limit disease control. Three major sequential epigenetic remodeling events occur as naÃ¯ve CD8 T cells (TN) differentiate into TEX: initial activation， early bifurcation between effector (TEFF) and TEX precursors， and later differentiation of effector-like and terminal TEX subsets from progenitor TEX. The epigenetic factors mediating these transitions remain poorly understood. Here， we uncovered distinct roles for two versions of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex， BAF and PBAF， in TEX differentiation using in vivo CRISPR screening. Disruption of BAF ablated antigen-specific CD8 T cells early in chronic infection， suggesting a requirement for BAF-mediated remodeling in the early epigenetic remodeling events. In contrast， depletion of PBAF subunits enhanced TEX formation and promoted progenitor TEX differentiation into more differentiated TEX subsets by limiting accessibility of TCF-1 binding sites. Loss of PBAF improved tumor control alone and in combination with anti-PD-L1. Simultaneous depletion of BAF- and PBAF-specific subunits revealed that BAF is required for the beneficial impact of loss of PBAF on TEX differentiation. Thus， BAF and PBAF regulate epigenetic transitions in CD8 T cell differentiation， with PBAF acting at a later stage in exhaustion as a guardian to limit full TEX differentiation and preserve TEX progenitor populations with implications for cancer immunotherapy.,LCMV-specific CD8 T cells (P14) from Day 15 clone 13 infection were analyzed by ATAC sequencing to study chromatin accessability changes. Two biological replicates were analyzed for sgAno9 controls. For PBAF-distrupted samples (sgArid2 and sgPbrm1)， two guides were used， for two replicates per guide.,nan,

Microbiota dysbiosis associated with type 2 diabetes-like effects caused by chronic exposure to a mixture of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants in zebrafish [II],GSE233632,Danio rerio,Mixtures of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants (C-POPs-Mix) are chemically related risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however， the effects of chronic exposure to C-POPs-Mix on microbial dysbiosis remain poorly understood. Herein， male and female zebrafish were exposed to C-POPs-Mix at a 1:1 ratio of five organochlorine pesticides and Aroclor 1254 at concentrations of 0.02， 0.1， and 0.5 Î¼g/L for 12 weeks. We measured T2DM indicators in blood and profiled microbial abundance， richness， and evenness in the gut as well as transcriptomic and metabolomic alterations in the liver. Exposure to C-POPs-Mix significantly increased blood glucose levels while decreasing the abundance and alpha diversity of microbial communities only in females at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.1 Î¼g/L. The majorly identified microbial contributors to microbial dysbiosis were Bosea minatitlanensis， Rhizobium tibeticum， Bifidobacterium catenulatum， B. adolescentis， and Collinsella aerofaciens. PICRUSt results suggested that altered pathways were associated with glucose and lipid production and inflammation， which are linked to changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of the zebrafish liver. Metagenomics outcomes revealed close relationships between intestinal and liver disruptions to T2DM-related molecular pathways. Thus， microbial dysbiosis in T2DM-triggered zebrafish occurred as a result of chronic exposure to C-POPs-Mix， indicating strong hostâmicrobiome interactions.,Samples consisted of the control group and three treatment groups exposed to 0.02， 0.1， and 0.5 ug/L of C-POPs-Mix (containing five OCPs and Aroclor1254) for the mechanistic study to demonstrate the relationship between microbiota dysbiosis and type 2 diabetes in C-POPs-Mix exposed zebrafish. Six female livers were pooled for each group and used to perform RNA-seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. For 16S rRNA-seq analysis， total genomic DNAs were individually extracted from five intestines in each group and sequenced by Illumina Miseq system.,nan,
An RNAi Screen of RNA Helicases Identifies eIF4A3 as a Regulator of Embryonic Stem Cell Identity [CLIP-seq],GSE194010,Mus musculus,RNA helicases are involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism to direct their roles in gene expression， yet their functions in pluripotency control remain largely unexplored. Starting from an RNAi screen of RNA helicases， we identified that eIF4A3， a DEAD-box (Ddx) helicase component of the exon junction complex (EJC)， is essential for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically， we show that eIF4A3 post-transcriptionally controls the pluripotency-related cell cycle regulators and that its depletion causes cellular differentiation via cell cycle dysregulation.  Specifically， eIF4A3 is required for the efficient nuclear export of Ccnb1 mRNA， which encodes Cyclin B1， a key component of the pluripotency-promoting pathway during cell cycle progression of ESCs. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of eIF4A3 and its associated EJC in the post-transcriptional cell cycle control in maintaining stem cell pluripotency.,eIF4A3 transcriptome profiling was investigated via RNA-seq analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells.,36416264,Nucleic Acids Res
Transcriptomic atlas and interaction networks of brain cells in mouse CNS demyelination and remyelination [Trem2KO],GSE204769,Mus musculus,Demyelination is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis， leukoencephalopathies， cerebral vasculopathies and several neurodegenerative diseases. The cuprizone mouse model is widely used to simulate demyelination occurring in these diseases. Here， we present a high-resolution snRNA-seq analysis of gene expression changes across all brain cells in this model. We define signatures of prototypic responses to demyelination and remyelination for each cell type， including anti-stress， anti-oxidant-， metabolic-， hypoxia-， IFN-， and IL-33-driven responses， and validate them at the protein level and in IL-33R-deficient mice. We identify related transcription regulators underpinning these pathways， including STAT3， NF-ÎºB， OLIG1 and MAFB. Furthermore， snRNA- seq data provide novel insights into how various brain cell types connect and interact， defining complex circuitries previously unknown to impact demyelination and remyelination. As an explicative example， perturbation of microglia caused by TREM2 deficiency impacts the oligodendrocyte responses to demyelination. Altogether， this study provides a rich resource for future studies investigating mechanisms underlying demyelination and remyelination.,Single nucleus RNA-seq analysis of cortex and corpus callosum from WT and TREM2 knockout  mice treated with or without cuprizone. Three experimental groups were set up in each genotype: a) demyelination (5-week CPZ treatment); b) remyelination (5-week CPZ treatment， followed by 2-week regular chow); c) control (regular chow throughout the time course),36952346,Cell Rep
ARS2 instructs early transcription termination-coupled RNA decay by recruiting ZC3H4 to nascent transcripts [TT-Seq],GSE228383,Homo sapiens,The RNA-binding ARS2 protein is centrally involved in both early RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription termination and transcript decay. Despite its essential nature， the mechanisms by which ARS2 enacts these functions have remained unclear. Here， we show that a conserved basic domain of ARS2 binds a corresponding acidic-rich， short linear motif in the transcription restriction factor ZC3H4. This interaction recruits ZC3H4 to chromatin to elicit Pol II termination， independent of other early termination pathways defined by the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) and Integrator (INT) complexes. ZC3H4， in turn， directly connects to the ZCCHC8 component of the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex， hereby facilitating rapid degradation of the nascent RNA. Hence， ARS2 instructs the coupled transcription termination and degradation of the transcript onto which it is bound. This contrasts with ARS2 function at CPA-instructed termination sites where the protein exclusively partakes in RNA suppression via post-transcriptional decay.,ARS2， Cleavage and polyadenylation complex subunit CPSF73 (CPSF3)， Integrator complex subunit INTS11 and RNA exosome subunit RRP40 (EXOSC3) were knocked down in HeLa cells using siRNA.

Systematic screening of chromatin factors identifies divergent roles across haematopoiesis and leukaemia [scRNA-Seq],GSE213511,Mus musculus,Cellular differentiation-trajectories require extensive alterations in chromatin structure and function， elicited by a diverse array of chromatin-factors (CFs). Using haematopoiesis as a model-system， we combined bulk ex vivo and single-cell in vivo CRISPR screens to comprehensively characterise the role of CF families in cell-fate decisions. We uncover marked lineage specificities for many CFs， dissecting specific CF-dependencies in vivo at single-cell resolution. This highlights functional diversity among related CFs (i.e. BAF-subcomplexes， MLL-methyltransferases)， but also reveals functional redundancy among unrelated Repressive-complexes that restrain excessive myeloid differentiation. Epigenetic-profiling， molecularly explains CF lineage-dependencies， identifying differentiation stage-specific interactions between individual CFs and lineage-determining Transcription Factors (TFs). Intriguingly， non-canonical BAF remodeler disruption abrogates myeloid-TF function generating a pre-leukaemia phenotype. Screening CF functions in leukemia， we show that leukaemia cells abrogate normal CF function， restraining differentiation trajectories by engaging in novel CF-TF interactions that suggest potential therapeutic avenues. Together， our work greatly elucidates the role of CFs and their TF-partners across normal and malignant haematopoiesis.,Perturb-seq profiling of  CF-KOs in in vivo， ex vivo， and leukemia model systems,37580596,Nat Genet
Transcriptome analysis showed that tomato-rootstock enhanced salt tolerance of grafted seedlings was accompanied by multiple metabolic processes and gene differences,GSE233233,Solanum lycopersicum,Purpose: Grafting is a commonly used cultural practice to counteract salt stress and is especially important for vegetable production. However， it is not clear which metabolic processes and genes are involved in the response of tomato rootstocks to salt stress. Our goals is to elucidate the regulatory mechanism through which grafting enhances salt tolerance.Methods: The salt-sensitive tomato variety Zhongza 9 and the strongly salt-tolerant tomato rootstock variety QZ-006 (selected by the research group in the early stage) were used as experimental materials and were purchased from the Vegetable and Flower Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Beijing， CHN) and Beijing Kaixingelin Agricultural Technology Co.， Ltd. (Beijing， CHN)ï¼The leaves of the seedlings of every sample was added to 5 mL of HNO3 (65%~68%) after they were heated in a microwave digestion system for 2~3 hoursï¼RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platformï¼qRTâPCR was performed according to the instructions of a Fast Super EvaGreen qPCR Master Mix Kit (US EverbrightÂ®， Inc.)ï¼The amino acid contents in the tomato leaves were calculated by the external standard method. The chlorophyll of the seedlings was extracted with acetone-ethanol (1:1) ï¼An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine auxin (IAA)， gibberellin (GA)， cytokinin (ZR)， brassinolide (BR)， abscisic acid (ABA)， jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) contents， and kit purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific Co.， Ltd. (USA). Endogenous ethylene (ETH) was collected， fixed and determined according to the methods of Ling (Ling et al.，2008) using a Shimadzu 2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame ion detector. ETH standard gas was purchased from Sigma Company.Results: Compared with the NGS， the GSs were more salt tolerant， and the Na+ content in the leaves decreased significantly. Through transcriptome sequencing data analysis of 36 samples， we found that GSs exhibited more stable gene expression patterns， with a lower number of DEGs. WRKY and PosF21 transcription factors were significantly upregulated in the GSs compared to the NGSs. Moreover， the GSs presented more amino acids， a higher photosynthetic index and a higher content of growth-promoting hormones. The main differences between GSs and NGSs were in the expression levels of genes involved in the BR signalling pathway， with significant upregulation of XTHs.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that grafting on salt tolerant rootstocks can bring different metabolic processes and transcription levels changes to scion leaves， thereby the scion leaves show stronger salt tolerance. This information provides new insight into the mechanism underlying tolerance to salt stress regulation and provides useful molecular biological basis for improving plant salt resistance.,We first evaluated the salt damage index， electrolyte permeability and Na+ accumulation in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) leaves of grafted seedlings (GSs) and nongrafted seedlings (NGSs) subjected to 175 mmolÂ·Lâ 1 NaCl for 0-96 hï¼covering the front， middle and rear ranges.The experiment was conducted at the scientific research base of Hebei Agricultural University. (38 Â° 10 '- 40 Â° 00' N， 113 Â° 40 '- 116 Â° 20' E). When the tomato seedlings developed four leaves and one heart， the split grafting method was used to obtain GSs. We selected GSs and NGS that were uniform and displayed good growth， rinsed the roots， used Hoaglandâs nutrient solution formula for hydroponic cultivation， and used an oxygen pump to supplement oxygen to maintain the normal growth of the grafted tomato seedlings for 15 days after grafting,37332726,Front Plant Sci
Transcriptional response across estrous in the mouse dorsal hippocampus is dysregulated by Cnih3 mutation,GSE199722,Mus musculus,The hippocampus is a critical brain region for coordinating learning， memory， and behavior. In adult females， the estrus cycle alters these functions through the activity of steroids hormones， with well-characterized effects on cellular physiology and behavior. However，the molecular genetic basis of these outcomes has not been systematically explored. In order to better understand the role of sex and the estrous cycle in the hippocampus， we profiled the transcriptome of hippocampi from female mice in each stage of the estrus cycle， along with those of males. We identify only subtle sex differences in gene expression between the sexes on average， yet comparing males to individual estrous stages reveals ~100 genes deviating from male expression patterns at one point in their cyclic fluctuations across estrous cycle. These estrus-responsive genes are especially enriched in oligodendrocytes and glycinergic neurons， and are potentially regulated downstream of estrogen receptor repressed pathways. To further understand our previous observations of female- and estrous-specific behavioral outcomes in knockout of Cnih3， we performed the same profiling in the knockout strain. Surprisingly， Cnih3 knockouts showed far broader transcriptomic differences between estrous cycle stages and males， despite very subtle within-group-across-genotype expression changes. We show that Cnih3 knockout drives expression changes in opposing directions between males and all points of the estrous cycle， extensively accentuating the magnitude of sex-differential hippocampal gene expression compared to wild-types. We thus provide a novel resource characterizing estrous-specific gene expression patterns in the adult hippocampus， which can provide insights into mechanisms of sex differential neuropsychiatric functions and dysfunctions， and identify a role for Cnih3 in buffering the female brain against the transcriptional effects of estrous.,RNA-seq of dorsal hippocampus from wild-type C57/B6 and Cnih3 knockout (Frye 2021) adult male mice (nâ¥5 per genotype) and female mice at each estrous stage (n=4-7 females per stage),36849260,eNeuro

Acetylation of histone H2B marks active enhancers and predicts CBP/p300 target genes,GSE186349,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Chromatin features are widely used for genome-scale mapping of enhancers. However， discriminating active enhancers from other cis-regulatory elements， predicting enhancer strength， and identifying their target genes remains challenging. Here we establish histone H2B N-terminus multisite lysine acetylation (H2BNTac) as a genuine signature of active enhancers. H2BNTac prominently marks candidate active enhancers and a subset of promoters and discriminates them from ubiquitously active promoters. Two mechanisms afford the distinct H2BNTac specificity. (1) Unlike H3K27ac， H2BNTac is specifically catalyzed by CBP/p300. (2) H2A-H2B， but not H3-H4， are rapidly exchanged through transcription-induced nucleosome remodeling. H2BNTac-positive candidate enhancers show a high validation rate in orthogonal enhancer activity assays， and a vast majority of endogenously active enhancers are marked by H2BNTac and H3K27ac. Notably， H2BNTac intensity predicts enhancer strength and outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in predicting CBP/p300 target genes. These findings have broad implications for generating fine-grained enhancer maps and modeling CBP/p300-dependent gene regulation.,H2BNTac ChIP-seq before and after A-485  treatment in mES cell grown in 2i.

B. acidifaciens-derived small RNA promotes colitis development by targeting mucin 2 to impair the gut mucosal barrier function [RNA-Seq],GSE155040,Mus musculus,Background & Aims: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD)， but the underlying mechanisms by which colon bacteria contribute to the development of CD remain largely unclear. Here， we investigated whether colon bacteria， particularly Bacteroides acidifaciens (B. acidifaciens)， promote CD pathogenesis through their small RNAs (sRNAs).Methods: The composition of gut bacteria were analyzed in the fecal samples of IL-10 knockout (KO) mice and CD45RBhigh mice that spontaneously develop colitis via 16S amplification sequencing， and the expression pattern of B. acidifaciens in both experimental colitis mice and CD patients was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of B. acidifaciens and their total and small RNA contents on colitis development were evaluated in IL-10 KO mice. Furthermore， the expression profile of B. acidifaciens-derived sRNA (BA-sRNA) in IL-10 KO mice was established by RNA sequencing， and BA-sRNA-172 levels in experimental colitis mice and CD patients were determined. Lentivirus carrying BA-sRNA-172 and BA-sRNA-172-deficient B. acidifaciens were then constructed and used to investigate the role of BA-sRNA-172 in the development of colitis. The activities of BA-sRNA-172 in regulating mucin2 (MUC2) expression and gut mucosal barrier function was systematically studied by in situ hybridization， immunofluorescence staining， qRT-PCR， western blot， RNA pull-down and luciferase assays in vitro. Finally， the effects of anti-BA-sRNA-172 and anti-MUC2 shRNA on intestinal barrier function and colitis development were evaluated.Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow， we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 16，014 transcripts in the retinas of WT and Nrlâ/â mice with BWA workflow and 34，115 transcripts with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes， and 12 of these were validated with qRTâPCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRTâPCR for more than four orders of magnitude and a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8798. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Nrlâ/â retina， with a fold change â¥1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRTâPCR， demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to retinal function. Data analysis with BWA and TopHat workflows revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling.Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes， with biologic replicates， generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.,mRNA profiles of Complexes of biotinylated BA-sRNA-172 and lysates of Mice CECs,nan,
Intraperitoneal paclitaxel is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for treating mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma,GSE236502,Homo sapiens,Appendiceal adenocarcinomas (AAs) are a rare and heterogeneous mix of tumors for which few preclinical models exist. The rarity of AA has made performing prospective clinical trials difficult， which has partly contributed to AA remaining an orphan disease with no chemotherapeutic agents approved by the FDA for its treatment. AA has a unique biology in which it frequently forms diffuse peritoneal metastases but almost never spreads via a hematogenous route and rarely spreads to lymphatics. Given the localization of AA to the peritoneal space， intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of chemotherapy could be an effective treatment strategy. Here， we tested the efficacy of paclitaxel given by IP administration using three orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of AA established in immunodeficient NSG mice. Weekly IP paclitaxel treatment dramatically reduced AA tumor growth in all three PDX models. Comparing the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) to IP administration， IP delivery of paclitaxel was more effective with reduced systemic side effects in mice. Given the established safety record of IP paclitaxel in gastric and ovarian cancers， and lack of effective chemotherapeutics for AA， these data showing the activity of IP paclitaxel in orthotopic PDX models of mucinous AA support the evaluation of IP paclitaxel in a prospective clinical trial.,Comprehensive analyses of RNA-seq profiles comparing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of appendiceal cancer treated with intraperitoneal injections of paclitaxel versus those treated with saline control,37433032,Cancer Res
Pyruvate dehydrogenase fuels a critical citrate pool that is essential for Th17 cell effector functions (ATAC-Seq),GSE222878,Mus musculus,Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the central enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The importance of PDH function in Th17 cells is unknown. Here， we show that PDH is essential for the generation of a unique glucose-derived citrate pool needed for Th17 cell proliferation， survival and effector function. In vivo， mice harboring a T cell-specific deletion of PDH were less susceptible to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically， the absence of PDH in Th17 cells increased glutaminolysis， glycolysis， and lipid uptake in an mTOR-dependent manner. However， cellular citrate remained critically low in mutant Th17 cells， which interfered with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)， lipid synthesis and histone acetylation crucial for the transcription of Th17 signature genes. Increasing cellular citrate in PDH-deficient Th17 cells restored their metabolism and function， identifying a metabolic feedback loop within central carbon metabolism that may offer possibilities for therapeutically targeting Th17 cell-driven autoimmunity.,ATAC,36848289,Cell Rep
BAF complex maintains glioma stem cells in pediatric H3K27M-glioma [scRNA-seq],GSE212782,Homo sapiens,Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are uniformly fatal pediatric central nervous system cancers， refractory to standard of care therapeutic modalities. The primary genetic drivers are a set of recurrent amino acid substitutions in genes encoding histone H3 (H3.3 and H3.1， K27M)， which are currently undruggable. These H3K27M oncohistones perturb normal chromatin architecture， resulting in an aberrant epigenetic landscape， which we interrogated here for epigenetic dependencies using a CRISPR screen in patient-derived H3K27M-glioma neurospheres. We show that H3K27M-glioma cells are dependent on core components of the mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex for maintaining glioma stem cells in a cycling， oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-like state. Genetic perturbation of the BAF catalytic subunit SMARCA4 (BRG1)， as well as pharmacological suppression opposes proliferation， promotes differentiation， and improves overall survival of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. In summary， we demonstrate that therapeutic inhibition of BAF complex has translational potential for children with H3K27M-gliomas.,Gene expression profiling by single cell RNAseq of BT869 cells upon SMARCA4 knockout.,36305736,Cancer Discov
C/EBPÎ± confers dependence to fatty acid anabolic pathways and vulnerability to lipid oxidative stress-induced ferroptosis in FLT3-mutant leukemia [ATAC-seq],GSE227400,Homo sapiens,While transcription factor C/AAT-enhancer binding protein Î± (C/EBPÎ±) is critical for normal and leukemic differentiation， its role on cell and metabolic homeostasis is largely unknown in cancer. Here， multi-omics analyses uncovered a coordinated activation of C/EBPÎ± and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that increased lipid anabolism in vivo and in patients with FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically， C/EBPÎ± regulated FASN-SCD axis to promote fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and desaturation. We further demonstrated that FLT3 or C/EBPÎ± inactivation decreased mono-unsaturated FAs incorporation to membrane phospholipids through SCD downregulation. Consequently， SCD inhibition enhanced susceptibility to lipid redox stress， which was exploited by combining FLT3 and glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibition to trigger lipid oxidative stress， enhancing ferroptotic death of FLT3-mutant AML cells. Altogether， our study reveals a C/EBPÎ± function in lipid homeostasis and adaptation to redox stress， and a previously unreported vulnerability of FLT3-mutant AML to ferroptosis with promising therapeutic application.,shCTL and shC/EBPÎ± MOLM14 cells (in biological duplicates) were FACS-sorted， and ATAC-seq was performed as previously described (94) with minor modifications. Briefly， 50 000 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer and the transposition reaction was performed using the Tn5 transposase at 37Â°C for 30 min. DNA was purified using the QIAGEN MinElute kit (QIAGEN). The libraries were prepared using Tagment DNA Enzyme and Buffer kits (Illumina)， NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB， catalog # M0541S) with custom sequencing primers (95â98). The libraries were purified twice using AMPure XP beads (Beckman) following a double-sided protocol to remove primer dimers and large fragments. Libraries quality was assessed using the NGS High Sensitivity Kit on the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， USA). Only high-quality libraries were subsequently equimolarly pooled and sequencing was performed at the PÃ´le Technologique du CRCT â Plateau de GÃ©nomique et Transcriptomique (Inserm-UMR1037， Toulouse， France). The pool of libraries was quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche， Basel， Switzerland) to obtain an accurate quantification. Sequencing was then performed on one flowcell of the Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina， San Diego， USA)， using the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (150 Cycles)， and a paired-end 2 x 75 pb strategy.

Multimodal epigenetic changes and altered NEUROD1 chromatin binding in the mouse hippocampus underlie FOXG1 syndrome,GSE189116,Mus musculus,The data presented in this study enlighten for the first time in a comprehensive manner diverse and multi-modal functions of FOXG1 at the chromatin level in mature neurons. Despite FOXG1 being recognized as a key transcription factor for telencephalic development and neuronal function， insights into the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation are sparse. We here show that (i) FOXG1 acts both as repressor and activator， (ii) localizes predominantly to enhancer regions， (iii) alters the epigenetic landscape， (iv) affects directly HDAC functions， and (v) acts in concert with NEUROD1 to instruct transcriptional programs necessary for axono- and synaptogenesis.,RELACS ChIP-seq of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were performed in DIV11 hippocampal neurons from E18.5 mice.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the mouse Dorsomedial Hypothalamic Nucleus (DMH),GSE232230,Mus musculus,Single-cell RNA-seq data from the mouse Dorsomedial Hypothalamic Nucleus (DMH) was generated following a modified protocol fromhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2821-8.Briefly， six 7.5 week old C57B6 mice (3 male， 3 female) were anaesthetized with isoflurane. Brains were rapidly extracted and dropped into ice-cold carbogenated NMDG-HEPES-ACSF. Brain sections (2 mm) containing DMH were cut with a razor blade on a stainless steel brain matrix (51392， Stoelting) and transferred to a dissection dish  on  ice  containing  NMDG-HEPES-ACSF.  DMH  was  bilaterally  microdissected  in  ~700Â·700Â·350 micron tissue block. Microdissected tissue was aggregated in a collection tube on ice containing NMDG-HEPES-ACSF  and  30  Î¼M  actinomycin  D.  For  enzymatic  tissue  digestion，  NMDG-HEPES-ACSF  was replaced  by trehalose-HEPES-ACSF  containing papain  (50  U/ml;  P3125，  Sigma Aldrich，  pre-activated with 2.5 mM cysteine and a 30-min incubation at 34 Â°C and supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA) and 15 Î¼M actinomycin D. Extracted DMH tissue was incubated at room temperature with gentle carbogenation for 55 min. During enzymatic digestion the tissue was pipetted periodically every 10 min. At the end of enzymatic digestion， the medium was replaced with 200Î¼l of room temperature trehalose-HEPES-ACSF containing  3  mg/ml  ovomucoid  inhibitor  (OI-BSA，Worthington)25  U/ml  DNase  I (90083，  Thermo Scientific) and 15 Î¼M actinomycin D and tissue was gently triturated into a uniform single-cell suspension with fire-polished glass Pasteur pipettes. The resulting cell suspension volume was brought up to 1 ml with trehalose-HEPES-ACSF with 3 mg/ml ovomucoid inhibitor and pipetted through a 40Î¼m cell strainer. Single-cell suspension was centrifuged down at 300g for 5 min at 4 Â°C and the supernatant was replaced with 1 ml fresh ice-cold trehalose-HEPES-ACSF and the cell pellet was resuspended. Cells were pelleted again  and  resuspended  in  100  Î¼l  of  ice-cold  resuspension-ACSF.  Cell  suspensions  were  kept on  ice while cell densities were quantified with a haemocytometer and the final cell densities were verified to be in  the  range  of  300â1，000  cells/Î¼l.  Cell  suspension  volumes  estimated  to  retrieve  ~10，000  single-cell transcriptomes were added to the 10x Genomics RT reaction mix and loaded to the 10X Next GEM Chip G  (2000177， 10x Genomics) per the manufacturerâs protocol. We used the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3â Reagents Kit v3.1 (1000128， 10x Genomics) and the Single Index Kit Set A (100213) to prepare Illumina sequencing libraries downstream of reverse transcription following the manufacturerâs protocol. Resulting  scRNA-seq  sequencing  library  was  sequenced  on  an  Illumina  NovaSeq  6000  sequencers (paired-end 150). Sequencing  data  were  aligned  to  optimized  pre-mRNA  reference  transcriptome52  and  digital  gene-cell matrices were generated with the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v.6.0.0 count pipeline. The resulting scRNA-seq  data  were  analyzed  in  R  (4.1.2)  using  Seurat  (v.4.1.0.9007)  as  previously  described51. Briefly， expression data were filtered to exclude cells with fewer than 1，000 unique transcripts as well as cells exhibiting  more  than  15%  of  mitochondrial  transcripts.  We  followed  the  standard  Seurat  workflow  to identify transcriptomic cell-types and assigned cel class identities based on canonical cell-type markers: Ndrg4 for neurons， Ntsr2 for astrocytes， Slco1c1 for endothelial cells， Fcer1g for microglia and Mag for oligodendrocytes. We digitally extracted neuronal clusters from our dataset resulting in expression data for 4587 DMH neurons that we used to establish an unbiased neuronal nomenclature for DMH.,Two separate groups of mice (3 male， 3 female each per sample) were processed for tissue extraction from DMH and single cell suspension generation.,nan,
Classification of IRF3- vs ISGF3-dependent gene induction in murine fibroblasts,GSE224855,Mus musculus,To investigate the dependency on gene expression on the PRR-activated transcription factor IRF3 versus the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR)-activated transcription factor ISGF3， we extracted primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) of wild-type， IRF3-knockout or IFNAR-knockout mice (strain C57BL/6J， protocol of Podlech et al.， 2002).We stimulated the 3 different cell lines by transfection of immunostimulatory DNA (ISD， 4 hours) for activation of IRF3， or by treatment with murine IFNbeta (3 hours) for activation of the IFNAR-ISGF3 cascade. Mock-transfected (4 hours) or untreated cells served as respective controls.In the last 2 hours before harvest， cells were additionally treated with 200ÂµM 4-thiouridine (4sU) for metabolic labelling of nascent transcripts， and total mRNAs were processed accordingly by SLAM-sequencing procedures for gene expression profiling of newly synthesized transcripts.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of nascent transcripts from SLAM-seq data for gene induction by PRR-IRF3 vs. by IFNAR-ISGF3 signalling.,37289084,J Virol

High-throughput identification of Toxoplasma gondii effector proteins that target host cell transcription,GSE229505,Toxoplasma gondii;Homo sapiens,Intracellular pathogens and other endosymbionts reprogram host cell transcription to suppress immune responses and recalibrate biosynthetic pathways. This reprogramming is critical in determining the outcome of infection or colonization. We combine pooled CRISPR knockout screening with dual host-microbe single-cell RNA sequencing， a method we term dual perturb-seq， to identify the molecular mediators of these transcriptional interactions. Applying dual perturb-seq to the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii， we are able to identify previously uncharacterized effector proteins and directly infer their function from the transcriptomic data. We show that TgGRA59 contributes to the export of other effector proteins from the parasite into the host cell and identify an effector， TgSOS1， that is necessary for sustained host STAT6 signaling and thereby contributes to parasite immune evasion and persistence. Together， this work demonstrates a tool that can be broadly adapted to interrogate host-microbe transcriptional interactions and reveal mechanisms of infection and immune evasion.,Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with a pool of Toxoplasma gondii CRISPR mutants for 24 h. Direct-capture perturb-seq using 10x Genomics 3' Gene Expression with Feature Barcoding was carried out on infected cells to identify perturbations in the intracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites that alter the transcriptome of the host cell. Three experiments were carried out: (1) A pilot experiment in which the Toxoplasma gondii parasites were transfected with two different perturb-seq plasmid vectors. (2) A pilot experiment in which the parasites were transfected with a panel of 24 plasmids. (3) A screen in which the parasites were transfected with a pool of 1，312 plasmids with sgRNAs targeting 256 genes. This screen was carried out in both unstimulated and interferon-gamma-stimulated HFFs. Three replicates were carried out for unstimulated HFFs and two for interferon-gamma-stimulated HFFs， with 2-4 Chromium Controller channels per replicate.,37827122,Cell Host Microbe
Massively parallel base editing to map variant effects in human hematopoiesis,GSE215253,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Systematic evaluation of the impact of genetic variants is critical for the study and treatment of human physiology and disease. While specific mutations can be introduced by genome engineering， we still lack scalable approaches that are applicable to the important setting of primary cells， such as blood and immune cells. Here， we describe the development of massively parallel base-editing screens in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Such approaches enable functional screens for variant effects across any hematopoietic differentiation state. Moreover， they allow rich phenotyping through single-cell RNA sequencing readouts， and separately， characterization of editing outcomes through pooled single-cell genotyping. We efficiently design improved leukemia immunotherapy approaches， comprehensively identify non-coding variants modulating fetal hemoglobin expression， define mechanisms regulating hematopoietic differentiation， and probe the pathogenicity of uncharacterized disease-associated variants. These strategies will advance effective and high-throughput variant-to-function mapping in human hematopoiesis to identify the causes of diverse diseases.,Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with lentiviruses expressing pooled library sgRNAs were electroporated with high purity genome editor protein,37137305,Cell

Chromatin profiling of H3R2me2s in human malaria parasite,GSE214535,Plasmodium falciparum,Purpose: this study is to analyze the chromatin landscape of H3R2mes in Plasmodium falciparum.Methods: In this study， H3R2me2s enrichment in the chromatin of wildtype parasite at schizont stage was analyzed by Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) coupled with next generation sequencing (CUT&Tag-seq). Synchronized WT 3D7 at 40â46 hpi schizonts were harvested and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 1 min at room temperature， followed by lysis with 0.06% saponin. The parasite pellets were suspended in 100 Î¼l nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPESâKOH pH 7.9， 10 mM KCl， 0.1% Triton X-100， 20% Glycerol， 0.5 mM Spermidine， 1x EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail). Ten Î¼l of activated Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads (EpiCypher # 21-1401) were added to each sample (~0.5 Ã 106 nuclei) and incubated for 10 min. The bead-bound nuclei were resuspended in 50 Î¼l Antibody150 buffer (20 mM HEPES， pH 7.5， 150 mM NaCl， 0.5 mM spermidine， 1Ã protease inhibitor cocktail， 0.01% digitonin， 2 mM EDTA) containing 0.5 Î¼g of rabbit anti-H3R2me2s (Epigentek #A-3705-050) as the primary antibody or rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology #2729S) serving as a control.  The primary antibody was then removed， and nuclei were then incubated with 0.5 Î¼g of the secondary antibodies in 50 Î¼l of Digitonin150 buffer (Antibody150， no EDTA) at room temperature for 30 min.  The secondary antibodies were mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #31213). The nuclei were washed thrice with 200 Î¼l Digitonin150 Buffer for 5 min to remove unbound antibodies and finally resuspended in 50 Î¼l Digitonin300 Buffer (Digitonin150 but with 300 mM NaCl). Then， 2.5 Î¼l of CUTANA pAG-Tn5 (EpiCypher #15-1017) were added to each reaction at room temperature for 1 h. The nuclei were washed thrice for 5 min in 200 Î¼l Digitonin300 Buffer to remove the unbound pA-Tn5. Next， the nuclei were resuspended in 50 Î¼l Tagmentation buffer (10 mM MgCl2 in Digitonin300) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. The beads were washed with 50 Âµl TAPS buffer (10 mM TAPS， pH 8.5， 0.2 mM EDTA)， mixed with 5 ÂµL SDS release buffer (10 mM TAPS pH 8.5; 0.1% SDS) to quench tagmentation， and then incubated for 1 hr at 58ÂºC to release tagmented chromatin into solution. Finally， 15 Âµl of 0.67% Triton-X was added to each reaction to quench SDS. PCR with appropriate barcoded primers was performed using the CUTANA High Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (EpiCypher #15-1018) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Amplified DNA libraries were captured by incubating with 1.3 Ã Kapa pure beads (Roche #KK8001) according to the manufacturer's recommendations， and next-generation sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 550 platform. The reads of CUT&Tag-seq from three biological replicates were mapped to the P. falciparum genome (PlasmoDB Release 39.0) by using BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) after FastQC quality control. The peak calling was finished by MACS2 version 2.2.7.1 with parameters âcallpeak -f BAMPEâ and a q-value cutoff of 0.05.Results: The three replicates of CUT&Tag-seq using nuclei from the schizont stage showed high reproducibility， with correlation coefficients of ~0.8. Peak calling using criteria of presence in at least two of three replicates with at least 50% overlap of the peaks identified 1629 H3R2me2s signals， distributed among the 14 chromosomes. Among these peaks， 57% (927) are localized at 5â UTR regions of 791 genes， 35% (577) at coding regions of 470 genes， and 8% (125) at 3â UTR regions of 115 genes. The peaks are ~17.44 bp wide and ~1265 bp from the ATG sites. Comparing the transcriptome data showed genes with H3R2me2s enrichment in the 5â UTRs showed significantly higher expression than other genes in the genome， suggesting that H3R2me2s is associated with gene activation. In addition， H3R2me2s peaks were highly co-localized with the active mark H3K9Ac， H2A.Z， and H3K4me3， further implying H3R2me2s as a euchromatin mark. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed a multitude of cellular pathways， including merozoite invasion， transcription， translation， stress response， cell cycle， schizogony， cell adhesion， exit from RBC， vesicle transport， signal transduction， DNA repair， and telomere organization， which are potentially regulated by this euchromatic mark.Conclusions: Collectively， H3R2me2s is a active chromatin mark and regulates invasion and other important processes in human malaria parasite.,H3R2me2s chromatin profiles in 3D7 (WT)at schizont stage were generated by CUT&Tag-seq， in triplicate,37349497,Commun Biol

Teosinte Pollen Drive guides maize domestication and evolution by RNA interference [iPARE-seq],GSE234922,Zea mays subsp. mays x Zea mays subsp. mexicana,Meiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis， while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males.  Cryptic drive is thought to be pervasive and can be unleashed following hybridization with a naÃ¯ve genome， resulting in sterility and hybrid incompatibility. Using single molecule and single pollen genome sequencing， we describe an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana)， that depends on RNA interference (RNAi) in the male germline. Multiple hairpin-derived small RNA from mexicana target a novel domestication gene，  Teosinte Drive Responder，  that is required for pollen fertility and has undergone selection for immunity to RNAi.  Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas.  A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals allelic bias at genes required for RNAi on at least 4 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids.  Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication， and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of hairpin-encoded and other endogenous small RNA  in the germlines of plants and animals.,iPARE sequencing of Tpd (Tpd1+/-;Tpd2+/) and WT (tpd1;tpd2) bulk pollen,39112710,Nature
Scalable co-sequencing of RNA and DNA from individual nuclei,GSE224149,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We present DEFND-seq (DNA and Expression From Nucleosome Depletion)， a scalable method for co-sequencing RNA and DNA from single nuclei. In DEFND-seq we treat nuclei with lithium diiodosalicylate to disrupt chromatin and expose genoimc DNA. The nuclei are then tagmented with Tn5 transposase， which fragments and tags gDNA. Tagmented nuclei are loaded into a microfluidic droplet generator which combines nuclei， beads containing transcriptomic and genomic barcodes， and reverse transcription reagents into single droplets. Ultimately two libraries are created， one for nuclear mRNA and one for genomic DNA， with each library containing barcodes linking it to its nuclei of origin， thus allowing simultaneous analysis of single nuclei transcriptomes and genomes. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes， all steps can be performed using a 10x Chromium Controller and 10x Multiome Kit without further experimental modification.,DEFND-seq (snRNA/DNA-seq)， snATAC-seq， snDNA-seq,36798358,bioRxiv
Transcript buffering and 3Ê¹UTR lengthening are shaped during human neurodevelopment by shifts in mRNA stability and microRNA load,GSE212990,Homo sapiens,The change in abundance of individual mRNAs as cells differentiate through neurodevelopmental stages is generally attributed to transcription level alterations while the potential contribution of mRNA half-life is commonly overlooked. While some genes are regulated solely by transcription， others may be regulated by mRNA half-life only， or genes with changed transcription rates could be buffered by compensating half-life decreases or even boosted by amplifying half-life increases. In addition， during neurodevelopment there is widespread 3Ê¹UTR lengthening that could be shaped by differential shifts in the stability of transcript isoforms. Here we measure transcription rate and mRNA half-life changes during induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived neuronal development using RATE-seq at the resolution of gene isoforms. We found that during transitions to progenitor and neuron stages， transcript buffering occurs in up to half of all genes. Half-life only changes are observed in as many genes as transcription rate only changes， and almost 10% of genes exhibit transcript boosting. Global mRNA half-life decreases two-fold in neurons relative to iPSCs. The observed mRNA destabilization differentially affects gene isoforms and contributes to 3Ê¹UTR lengthening. Small RNA sequencing further captured an increase in microRNA copy number per cell. We propose that mRNA destabilization and 3Ê¹UTR lengthening are driven in part by an increase in microRNA load. Our findings identify mRNA stability mechanisms in human neurodevelopment that regulate gene and isoform level abundance and provide a precedent for similar post-transcriptional regulatory events as other tissues develop.,Human iPSCs and iPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells were subjected to RATE-seq and miRNA-seq to characterize changes in transcription rate and RNA stability.,nan,
NFIA in adipocytes reciprocally regulates mitochondrial and inflammatory gene program to improve glucose homeostasis [ChIP-seq],GSE200192,Mus musculus,Adipose tissue is central to regulation of systemic energy homeostasis. Adaptive thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes， which relies on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation， dissipates energy to counteract obesity. On the other hand， chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is linked to insulin resistance， type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here we show that nuclear factor I-A (NFIA)， a transcriptional regulator of brown and beige adipocytes， improves systemic glucose homeostasis via up-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and reciprocal down-regulation of inflammation. Mice with transgenic expression of NFIA in adipocytes exhibited improved glucose tolerance， increased energy expenditure and limited weight gain on high fat diet. NFIA coordinately up-regulate genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation as well as a battery of brown-fat-specific genes through enhancer activation that involves facilitated genomic binding of PPARÎ³. In contrast， NFIA in adipocytes， but not in macrophages， down-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine genes to ameliorate adipose tissue inflammation in vivo. NFIA binds to enhancer/promoter region of Ccl2 gene that encodes pro-inflammatory cytokine MCP-1， to down-regulate its transcription. NFIA expression and CCL2 expression was negatively correlated in human adipose tissue. These results indicate that NFIA in adipocytes reciprocally regulate mitochondrial and inflammatory gene program to improve systemic glucose homeostasis.,ChIP-seq analysis of WT and NFIA-Tg adipocytes,37487068,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
Regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter expression and calcium signalling by lncRNA Tug1 in cardiomyocytes,GSE237787,Rattus norvegicus,Cardiomyocyte Ca2+ is buffered by mitochondria via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. The MCU complex consists of pore-forming proteins including the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)， and regulatory proteins such as mitochondrial calcium uptake proteins 1 and 2 (MICU1/2). The stoichiometry of these proteins influences the sensitivity to Ca2+ and activity of the complex. However， the factors that regulate their gene expression remain incompletely understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression through various mechanisms， and we recently found that the lncRNA Tug1 affected the expression of MCU-associated genes. To further explore this， we knocked down Tug1 (Tug1 KD) in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes using antisense LNA oligo. This led to increased MCU protein expression yet this did not enhance a marker of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. RNA-seq revealed that Tug1 KD increased Mcu and led to differential expression of genes and pathways related to Ca2+ regulation in the heart. To understand the effect of this on Ca2+ signalling， we measured phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and its downstream target cAMP Response Element-Binding protein (CREB)， a transcription factor known to promote Mcu gene expression. Tug1 KD attenuated the increase in CAMKII and CREB phosphorylation in response to ionomycin， a Ca2+ ionophore. Inhibition of CaMKII， but not CREB， partially prevented the Tug1 KD mediated increase in Mcu. Together， these data suggest that Tug1 modulates MCU expression via a mechanism that may involve CAMKII and CREB. The Tug1 mediated regulation of MCU on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake， may have functional consequences for cellular Ca2+ handling which could have implications for cardiac disease.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for H9c2 cells with or without antisense LNA-mediated knockdown of Tug1,37721002,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol
microRNA-132 regulates gene expression programs involved in microglial homeostasis,GSE230333,Mus musculus,microRNA-132 (miR-132)， a known neuronal regulator， is one of the most robustly downregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the brain of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) patients. Increasing miR-132 in AD mouse brain ameliorates amyloid and Tau pathologies， and also restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis and memory deficits. However， the functional pleiotropy of miRNAs requires in-depth analysis of the effects of miR-132 supplementation before it can be moved forward for AD therapy. We employ here miR-132 loss- and gain-of-function approaches using single-cell transcriptomics， proteomics and in silico AGO-CLIP datasets to identify molecular pathways targeted by miR-132 in mouse hippocampus. We find that miR-132 modulation significantly affects the transition of microglia from a disease-associated to a homeostatic cell state. We confirm the regulatory role of miR-132 in shifting microglial cell states using human microglial cultures derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.,Cells from the right hippocampus of mice treated with miR-132 antagomiR/scrambled control and miR-132 mimic/negative control were isolated by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on viability (e780， replicates 1 and 3) and in addition for the presence or absence of YFP signal (neurons) or CD11b and ACSA-2 (astrocytes) (replicates 2， 4 and 5) and analyzed using scRNAseq.,37250784,iScience

A quantitative model for the transcriptional landscape of the bacterial cell cycle,GSE217715,Escherichia coli;Staphylococcus aureus;Bacillus subtilis,Regulation of gene activity during the cell cycle is fundamental to bacterial replication but is challenging to study in unperturbed， asynchronous bacterial populations. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of heterogeneous Staphylococcus aureus populations， we uncovered a global gene expression pattern dominated by chromosomal position. We show that this pattern results from the effect of DNA replication on gene expression， and in Escherichia coli， changes under different growth rates and modes of replication. By constructing a quantitative model in each species that links replication to cell cycle gene expression， we identified divergent genes that may be instead subject to distinct regulation， and applied this cell cycle framework to characterize heterogeneity in responses to antibiotic stress. Our approach reveals a highly dynamic cell cycle transcriptional landscape and may be broadly applicable across species.,scRNA-seq by the PETRI-seq method was performed on bacteria of species Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.scRNA-seq by the PETRI-seq method was performed on bacteria of species Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.,37034646,Res Sq

IFNg-producing Tfh cells control the differentiation of lung resident memory B cells,GSE208322,Mus musculus,T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a specific subset of CD4 T cells that localize in the B cell follicle and are essential for the Germinal Center (GC) response. Under polarizing environments， Tfh cells produce IFN-g. Beyond promoting class switching， the role played by IFN-g-producing Tfh cells remains largely unexplored. Using an influenza infection model， we show here that interactions with IFN-Î³ producing Tfh cells during the peak of the response skew the GC B cell response towards the memory differentiation pathway. Consequently， lung-memory B cells fail to differentiate without IFN-Î³ producing Tfh cells. Collectively， our results support a model in which temporary changes in cytokine production by Tfh cells dynamically control the outcome of the GC response.,RNAseq was performed for the following (in triplicate for each sample type): 1. C57BL/6 mice were irradiated and reconstituted with a 50:50 mix of bone marrow from CD45.1+ B6 (WT) and CD45.2+ IfngR1-/- donors. Eight weeks later， reconstituted mice were infected with PR8 influenza virus， and WT and IfngR1-/- GC B cells were sorted from the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node on day 12 after infection; 2.

MNase-seq facilitates quantitative analysis of nucleosome positioning of wild type and mutant SWI/SNF complexes,GSE218808,Caenorhabditis elegans,Purpose: The goal of this study is to evaluate potentially direct targets of altered chromatin remodeller SWI/SNF on nucleosome positioning at gene promoters by means of MNase-sequencing from synchronised L1-staged swsnâ1 single mutant， swsnâ1; snfcâ5 double mutants， swsnâ1; snfcâ5; ubrâ5 triple mutants compared to wild-type animals to achieve genome-wide nucleosome coverage profiles.Methods: In vivo MNAse-seq profiles of WT (N2)， swsn-1-/- (MH2354， SX3714)， swsn-1-/-; snfc-5-/- (SX3622， SX3715)， swsn-1-/-; snfc-5-/-; ubr-5-/- (SX3627) C. elegans L1s were generated by deep sequencing， in duplicate， using Illumina NextSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to C. elegans (ce11) genome using bowtie2 aligner v.2.2.9. The resulting bam files were converted to bigwig tracks using deeptools bamCoverage.Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow， we mapped about 50 million sequence reads per sample to the C elegans genome (build ce11). MNase-Seq data was further analysed locus-by-locus for nucleosome positioning around transcription start site of ubiquitous genes in the mutants relative to wild-type coverage. Swsn-1 single mutants showed strongly reduced +1 nucleosome coverage in compare to the wild-type animals. The +1-nucleosome coverage in both the swsn-1; snfc-5 double and swsn-1; snfc-5; ubr-5 triple suppressor mutants was higher than in swsn-1 single mutants. We also established that the subsets of ubiquitously up and downregulated SWI/SNF-dependent genes have a higher nucleosome coverage in wild-type animals when compared to all ubiquitous genes in wild-type animals.,In vivo MNAse-Seq profiles of WT， swsn-1-/-， swsn-1-/-; snfc-5-/- ， swsn-1-/-; snfc-5-/-; ubr-5-/- C. elegans L1,36689659,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
SCENIC+: identification of enhancers and gene regulatory networks using single-cell multiomics (cell lines),GSE210745,Homo sapiens,Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression of individual cells provides an opportunity to decipher enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRN). Here we present a new method for the inference of eGRNs， called SCENIC+. SCENIC+ predicts genomic enhancers along with candidate upstream transcription factors (TF) and links these enhancers to candidate target genes. Specific TFs for each cell type or cell state are predicted based on the concordance of TF binding site accessibility， TF expression， and target gene expression. To improve both recall and precision of TF identification， we curated and clustered more than 40，000 position weight matrices that we could associate with ~1，500 human TFs. We validated and benchmarked each of the SCENIC+ components on diverse data sets from different species， including human peripheral blood mononuclear cell types， human ENCODE cell lines， human melanoma cell states， and Drosophila retinal development. Next， we exploit SCENIC+ predictions to study conserved TFs， enhancers， and GRNs between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally， we provide new capabilities that exploit the inferred eGRNs to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories; to map regulatory activities onto tissues using spatial omics data; and to predict the effect of TF perturbations on cell state. SCENIC+ provides critical insight into gene regulation， starting from multi-ome atlases of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. The SCENIC+ suite is available as a set of Python modules at scenicplus.readthedocs.io.,A mix of 11 wild type melanoma cell lines (MM050， MM099， MM116， MM001， MM011， MM057， MM087， MM031， MM047 and MM029) were analysed using 10x scATAC-seq experiments,37443338,Nat Methods
Optogenetic perturbations of RNA expression in tissue space,GSE185022,Homo sapiens,Quantifying gene expression in space， for example by spatial transcriptomics， is essential for describing the biology of cells and their interactions in complex tissues. Perturbation experiments， at single-cell resolution and conditional on both space and time， are necessary for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of these interactions. To this aim， we combined optogenetics and CRISPR technologies to activate or knock-down RNA of target genes， at single-cell resolution and in programmable spatial patterns. As a proof of principle， we optogenetically induced Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling at a distinct spatial location within human neural organoids. This robustly induced known SHH spatial domains of gene expression â cell-autonomously and across the entire organoid. In principle， our approach can be used to induce or knock down RNAs from any gene of interest in specific spatial locations or patterns of complex biological systems.,Total RNA-seq for two replicates of HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding: Rfx-Cas13d (CasRx)， a TetON TagRFP reporter， and either a non-targeting guide RNA or an RFP-targeting RNA. 10X Visium sequencing data from 4 samples of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) stably expressing a light-inducible Cre/Lox system and a LoxP-dsRed-LoxP-SHH-NeonGreen cassette for light-inducible overexpression of SHH.

Droplet-based genome-wide forward genetic screening of astrocyte-microglia communication mechanisms,GSE200457,Mus musculus,SPEACC-seq is a novel high-throughput method which enables forward genetic screens to identify cell-cell interaction mechanisms that uncovered an astrocyte-microglia regulatory circuit mediated by amphiregulin and IL33-ST2. signaling. Cell-cell interactions in the central nervous system (CNS) play central roles in neurologic diseases. However， little is known about the specific molecular pathways involved， and methods for their systematic identification are limited. For example， several factors mediate microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathology， but less is known about regulatory interactions that limit tissue pathology. Here we report the development of SPEACC-seq (Stimulation， Perturbation， and Encapsulation of interACting Cells followed by Sequencing)， a forward genetic screening platform which combines genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations， cell co-culture in picoliter droplets， and microfluidic-based fluorescence activated droplet sorting to identify mechanisms of cell-cell communication. Using SPEACC-seq in combination with an in vivo perturb-seq screen， we identified microglia-produced amphiregulin as a suppressor of disease promoting astrocyte responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)， a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The production of microglial amphiregulin was induced via ST2 signaling by IL-33 released from astrocytes during EAE. Indeed， the genetic inactivation of ST2 or amphiregulin in microglia， or IL-33 or amphiregulin signaling in astrocytes resulted in the worsening of EAE， suggesting that IL-33-induced microglial amphiregulin limits disease-promoting astrocyte responses associated with CNS pathology. This regulatory loop was also detected in human astrocytes and microglia both in vitro and in MS patient CNS samples. In summary， we developed SPEACC-seq， a high-throughput， droplet-based forward genetic screening platform for the identification of cell-cell interaction mechanisms， which identified a novel microglia-astrocyte negative feedback loop that limits CNS pathology.,For samples with 4OTR Prefix the experiment is designed to study the effect of IL33 knockout and ST2 knockout in Astrocytes and Microglia (3 samples for each condition in each cell type); for samples with 4M67 prefix the experiment contain samples with Areg knockout and Egfr knockout in Astrocytes and Microglia (3 samples for each condition). In the end two single cell experiment is conducted on the CNS tissue in Naive Mouse and EAE induced Mouse.,36893254,Science

Systematic Identification of CRISPR-mediated Off-target Effects by CROss-seq,GSE182568,Homo sapiens,We developed CROss-seq， a versatile， efficient and cost-effective method for genome-wide off-target profiling in multiple genome editing systems. Purpose: CRISPR-mediated genome editors have been widely deployed in basic research and therapeutic applications， yet the targeting specificity of these editors is still the major concern. Method to examine the genome-wide off-target effects of these editors remains lagging behind. Methods:  in vivo CROss-seq， the transfected cells are labeled with N3-kethoxal for 45 minutes; in vitro CROss-seq， the genomic DNA are incubated with N3-kethoxal for 2 hours. The treated gDNA are processed with biotin click reaction， fragmentation， adapter ligation， and pull-down steps. The purified libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform to generate paired-end reads. Results: Through CROss-seq we successfully both in vivo and in vitro to evaluate the off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease， base editors and prime editor. The in vivo assay was more specific while in vitro assay was more sensitive， highlighting the necessity of coupling in vivo and in vitro assays to achieve a comprehensive and precise assessment of the off-target effects. CROss-seq also revealed chromatin accessibility plays an important role in the off-target activity of the CRISPR-based editing. In addition， we identified limited genome-wide off-target sites of BE and PE in vivo， indicating that both editors were highly specific to target site.,CROss-seq utilized a high-specificity ssDNA capturing strategy， enables genome-wide profiling of on-target and off-target activity of CRISPR-mediated genome editors at the whole-genome level. We applied CROss-seq to off-target evaluation in HEK293T cells for Cas9， ABE7.10， ABE8e， BE3， BE4max and PE2， with several frequently used sgRNAs: âHBG1/2â， âHEK293 site 2â， and âHEK293 site 3â.,37084235,Protein Cell
Pyruvate dehydrogenase fuels a critical citrate pool that is essential for Th17 cell effector functions (RNA-Seq II),GSE222881,Mus musculus,Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the central enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The importance of PDH function in Th17 cells is unknown. Here， we show that PDH is essential for the generation of a unique glucose-derived citrate pool needed for Th17 cell proliferation， survival and effector function. In vivo， mice harboring a T cell-specific deletion of PDH were less susceptible to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically， the absence of PDH in Th17 cells increased glutaminolysis， glycolysis， and lipid uptake in an mTOR-dependent manner. However， cellular citrate remained critically low in mutant Th17 cells， which interfered with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)， lipid synthesis and histone acetylation crucial for the transcription of Th17 signature genes. Increasing cellular citrate in PDH-deficient Th17 cells restored their metabolism and function， identifying a metabolic feedback loop within central carbon metabolism that may offer possibilities for therapeutically targeting Th17 cell-driven autoimmunity.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Th17 cells with and without PDH knockout as well as with and without treatmnt with Acetate each with 4 replicates.,36848289,Cell Rep
Foreign RNA spike-ins enable accurate allele-specific expression analysis at scale [III],GSE228004,Caenorhabditis elegans;Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Analysis of allele-specific expression is strongly affected by the technical noise present in RNA-seq experiments. Previously， we showed that technical replicates can be used for precise estimates of this noise， and we provided a tool for correction of technical noise in allele-specific expression analysis. This approach is very accurate but costly due to the need for two or more replicates of each library. Here， we develop a spike-in approach that is highly accurate at only a small fraction of the cost.We show that a distinct RNA added as a spike-in before library preparation reflects technical noise of the whole library and can be used in large batches of samples. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using combinations of RNA from species distinguishable by alignment， namely， mouse， human， and C.elegans. Our new approach， controlFreq， enables highly accurate and computationally efficient analysis of allele-specific expression in (and between) arbitrarily large studies at an overall cost increase of â¼ 5%.,Comparative allele-specific expression analysis of RNA-seq data with foreign RNA spike-ins (mixes of human， mouse and C.elegans).,37387154,Bioinformatics

MacroH2A restricts melanoma progression via inhibition of chemokine expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts [epigenomics],GSE200734,Mus musculus,The histone variant macroH2A has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in melanoma and other cancers， yet its role in the tumor microenvironment remains unappreciated. Here we show that mice constitutively lacking macroH2A variants exhibit increased melanoma tumor burden compared to their wild-type counterparts， which is associated with an altered intratumoral immune cell compartment. MacroH2A-deficient tumors display an accumulation of immunosuppressive monocytes and decreased functional cytotoxic T cells. Consistent with this compromised anti-tumor response， macroH2A-deficient tumors displayed upregulation of chemokines such as Ccl2， Cxcl1 and Il6. Through single cell transcriptomics of the entire melanoma microenvironment， we identified the source of these pro-tumor myeloid chemoattractants as cancer-associated fibroblasts， whose frequency and activation were increased in the absence of macroH2A. Chemokine gene expression was hyper-inducible in the absence of macroH2A and accompanied by an altered epigenetic landscape. In sum， we uncovered a tumor suppressive role for macroH2A through repression of chemokine induction in the tumor stroma.,Epigenomic analysis of sorted or cultured CAFs from WT and macroH2A melanomas was carried out to understand how macroH2A regulates inflammatory gene expression in this cell type. iDFs were used as a related cell type， developed individually， to validate these findings.,37605008,Nat Cell Biol
Effect of MCMV M35 on global gene expression during PRR signalling in murine fibroblasts,GSE224852,Mus musculus,To investigate if the protein M35 of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) affects transcription of genes beside IFNbeta， we immortalised murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) isolated from wild-type C57BL/6J mice with SV40 Large T antigen to generate iMEF， and transduced these with retrovirus to stably express M35-HAHA or carry a control vector (EV).We stimulated the 2 different cell lines by transfection of Alexa488-labelled immunostimulatory DNA (ISD) for 2， 4 or 6 hours to activate the host transcription factor IRF3. Mock-transfected and untreated cells served as controls.In the last 90 min before harvest， cells were additionally treated with 200ÂµM 4-thiouridine (4sU) for metabolic labelling of nascent transcripts， and total mRNAs were processed accordingly by SLAM-sequencing procedures for gene expression profiling of newly synthesized transcripts.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of total transcripts from SLAM-seq data for differential gene expression in the presence of M35 compared to control cells at different time points of stimulation.,37289084,J Virol

Transient naive reprogramming corrects hiPS cells functionally and epigenetically,GSE159297,Homo sapiens,Cells undergo a major epigenome reconfiguration when reprogrammed to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). However， the epigenomes of hiPS cells and human embryonic stem (hES) cells differ significantly， which affects hiPS cell function. These differences include epigenetic memory and aberrations that emerge during reprogramming， for which the mechanisms remain unknown. Here we characterized the persistence and emergence of these epigenetic differences by performing genome-wide DNA methylation profiling throughout primed and naive reprogramming of human somatic cells to hiPS cells. We found that reprogramming-induced epigenetic aberrations emerge midway through primed reprogramming， whereas DNA demethylation begins early in naive reprogramming. Using this knowledge， we developed a transient-naive-treatment (TNT) reprogramming strategy that emulates the embryonic epigenetic reset. We show that the epigenetic memory in hiPS cells is concentrated in cell of origin-dependent repressive chromatin marked by H3K9me3， lamin-B1 and aberrant CpH methylation. TNT reprogramming reconfigures these domains to a hES cell-like state and does not disrupt genomic imprinting. Using an isogenic system， we demonstrate that TNT reprogramming can correct the transposable element overexpression and differential gene expression seen in conventional hiPS cells， and that TNT-reprogrammed hiPS and hES cells show similar differentiation efficiencies. Moreover， TNT reprogramming enhances the differentiation of hiPS cells derived from multiple cell types. Thus， TNT reprogramming corrects epigenetic memory and aberrations， producing hiPS cells that are molecularly and functionally more similar to hES cells than conventional hiPS cells. We foresee TNT reprogramming becoming a new standard for biomedical and therapeutic applications and providing a novel system for studying epigenetic memory.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual Series,37587336,Nature
SSN-seq: Multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic profiling via genetic barcoding with shielded small nucleotides,GSE201647,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,To facilitate scalable longitudinal profiling of single cells we developed a universal permanent genetic cell barcoding technology based on the expression of shielded small nucleotides coupled with single-cell RNA-seq (SSN-seq). SSN barcodes are highly expressed and contain direct-capture sequences to enable recovery of distinct barcodes directly in each single-cell transcriptome allowing cell identity history to be recorded over time， in parallel with cell identity. SSN-seq is compatible with both 3â and 5â single-cell profiling and is readily adaptable to numerous cell types including human primary T cells and CAR T cells making it a promising tool for rapidly improving adoptive cell therapies and expanding their functionality. We applied SSN-seq to track the dynamics of CAR T cell states at the time of infusion and upon isolation from in vivo tumor rechallenge model. Our study identified that a novel combination of cytokines and small molecule inhibitors used for CAR T cells manufactured ex vivo， promotes the expansion of persistent CD4+ memory T cell populations in vivo. Together， these results demonstrate the utility of our method for multiplexed perturbation experiments that reveal the dynamics of cell states over time， with a high degree of confidence.,scRNA-seq of SSN-barcoded cells in vitro and in vivo,37652986,Nat Biomed Eng
Complex regulation of Eomes levels mediated through distinct functional features of the Meteor long non-coding RNA locus (scRNA-Seq),GSE223452,Mus musculus,Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are diverse transcription products emanating from thousands of loci in mammalian genomes， implicated in a wide array of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation， differentiation， cellular reprogramming， and many others. While a large majority of functional lncRNAs have been proposed to act in cis to their sites of transcription， an in-depth understanding of the functional features within such lncRNA loci， as well as their mechanisms of action， is currently lacking. Further insights are hindered by the heavy dependencies of observed phenotypes on the perturbation techniques employed. Here， we study Meteor， a lncRNA transcribed nearby the gene encoding for Eomes， a pleiotropic transcription factor with highly regulated spatiotemporal expression patterns throughout early development and in adult tissues. Using a wide array of perturbation techniques， we show that transcription elongation through the Meteor locus is required for Eomes activation in naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)， with Meteor repression linked to a reduction in cells potentiated to differentiate to the mesoderm lineage. We further demonstrate that a distinct functional feature of the locus â namely， the underlying DNA element â is required for suppressing Eomes expression following neuronal differentiation of mESCs. Our results demonstrate the complex regulation that can be conferred by a single lncRNA locus， and emphasize the importance of careful selection of perturbation techniques for the study of lncRNA loci.,scRNA-seq of WT and Meteor promoter KO mESCs,39009604,Nat Commun

Epigenetic plasticity cooperates with emergent cell-cell interactions to drive neoplastic tissue remodeling in the pancreas [ATAC-seq],GSE207698,Mus musculus,In pancreatic cancer， select cells within a homogeneous epithelium drive tumorigenesis in response to an environmental trigger， suggesting key uncharacterized roles for epigenetics and cellular context. To investigate epigenetic plasticity in early tumorigenesis， we performed single-cell transcriptional and chromatin accessibility sequencing of Kras-mutant pancreatic cancer models， encompassing initiation to malignant stages and wild-type tissue. Our analysis identifies a few progenitor states that correspond to known cells-of-origin， exhibit the greatest measured epigenetic plasticity， and are primed for diverse neoplastic fates. Plasticity is strongly associated with accessibility near receptor and ligand loci. We delineated robust communication modules and a feedback loop between IL33-expressing epithelial and immune cells with broad tissue impacts， which we confirmed by genetic perturbation in mice. Our results promise to nominate early interception strategies for this lethal cancer.,Characterization of single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) profiles of lineage-traced pancreatic epithelial cells (mKate2+) freshly-isolated by FACS-sorting from benign neoplasia (K3) or malignant (K5)  pancreatic tissues: To characterize benign neoplasia (K3)， KC;RIK (Ptf1a-Cre;RIK;LSLKrasG12D) mice were treated with caerulein at 5 weeks of age， and mKate2+ cells were subjected to scATAC-seq analyses 3 weeks thereafter.

Data from additional pre-malignant stages (K1， K2) were extracted from GSE137069， from KC-RIK mice treated with caerulein or PBS at 5 weeks of age， and analyzed 2 days thereafter. 2 biological replicates (independent mice) were used per experimental condition.,37167403,Science
Effect of free D-Lactate in CNS pathology,GSE188500,Mus musculus,Dendritic cells (DCs) control the generation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells. Thus， DCs are attractive therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. Using single-cell and bulk transcriptional and metabolic analyses in combination with cell-specific gene perturbation studies we identified a negative feedback regulatory pathway that operates in DCs to limit immunopathology. Specifically， we found that lactate， produced by activated DCs and other immune cells， boosts NDUFA4L2 expression through a mechanism mediated by HIF-1a. NDUFA4L2 promotes mitochondrial fitness in DCs， limiting the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that activate XBP1-driven transcriptional modules involved in the control of pathogenic autoimmune T cells. Moreover， we engineered a probiotic that produces lactate and suppresses T-cell autoimmunity in the central nervous system via the activation of HIF-1a/NDUFA4L2 signaling in DCs. In summary， we identified a novel immunometabolic pathway that regulates DC function， and developed a synthetic probiotic for its therapeutic activation via the gut-brain axis.,WT mice were treated with D-lactate by intraperitoneal injections starting 3 days before experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induction. DCs were sorted from Central Nervous system and spleen at endpoint.,37558878,Nature

Runx transcription factors regulate early T-developmental progression by inducing T-lineage identity and innate lymphoid cell program genes via gene network regulation,GSE218149,Mus musculus,Runx transcription factors are essential for generating functional T cells starting from the earliest stages in thymic T-development.  To evaluate how Runx factors instruct T cell development， we perturbed Runx activities using 1) CRISPR-Cas9， simultaneously deleting two predominant， redundant Runx factors， Runx1 and Runx3， and 2) Runx1-overepxression at a stage before pro-T cells commit to a T cell fate. Then single-cell transcriptome analysis was performed.    Runx1/Runx3 knockout (KO) vs. Runx1 overexpression (OE) resulted in contrasting deviations from the normal developmental trajectory. The separation of both perturbation conditions from the controls implied that Runx factors regulate gene networks in individual cells to control separate pathways instead of changing distributions of cells among different stages along the control pathway.  Notably， a common core set of genes responded to both KO and OE， in opposite directions.  Runx activation target genes were selectively enriched for T-identity program and innate lymphoid cell program genes， whereas inhibition targets were significantly associated with stem/progenitor program and myeloid lineage pathways.  Pseudotime inference analysis suggested that Runx perturbations also substantially regulate developmental speed， as Runx KO significantly slowed down developmental progression， whereas Runx1 OE resulted in pronounced acceleration.  This interpretation was largely supported by Runx activities regulating key transcription factors involved in establishing distinct gene network modules during T cell development. Indeed， further analysis showed that Runx target genes get combinatorial inputs from these Runx-regulated transcription factors as well as from Runx factors themselves.   Together， our data suggest that Runx transcription factors drive early T developmental progression by launching gene expression modules associated with T-identity and innate lymphoid cells through mediating other transcription factor cooperativities.,To recapitulate early T cell development in a perturbation-accessible way， the OP9-Dll1 in vitro culture system was exploited.   For Runx1 overexpression conditions， freshly obtained bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells from 8-10 week old B6.Bcl2 transgenic mice were cultured on OP9-Dll1 cells with 10ng/ml of IL-7 and Flt3-ligand.  On day 2， MSCV-Runx1-mCherry or MSCV-empty-mCherry vectors were delivered using spinfection.  Two days after delivering retrovirus (total 4 days of culture) or 4 days post-infection (total 6 days of culture)， each of the experimental replicates was stained with a distinct hashtag oligo and live Lineage marker-negative， mCherry+， CD45+ cells were FACS sorted for transcriptome analysis.     For Runx1/Runx3 double knockout， slightly more time was allowed for the disruption of the targeted genes to reduce protein levels before gene expression was measured. Bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells from B6.Cas9;Bcl2 transgenic mice were co-cultured with OP9-Dll1 cells in medium supplemented with 10ng/ml each of IL-7 and Flt3-ligand. On day 2， E42-gRunx1-humanNGFR (hNGFR) and E42-gRunx3-mTurquoise vectors were retrovirally introduced.  Three gRNA pairs were utilized for each Runx1 and Runx3 targeting.   For control conditions， E42-gControl-humanNGFR (hNGFR) and E42-gControl-mTurquoise vectors were utilized， where control gRNA targets luciferase sequences. At 3 days post-infection (total 5 days of culture) or 6 days post-infection (total 8 days of culture)， each of the experimental replicates was stained with a different hashtag oligo and live Lineage-， mTurquoise+， hNGFR+， CD45+  cells were FACS sorted.

Enhanced STAT5a activation opposes Tox and rewires exhausted CD8 T cells towards a hybrid durable effector-like state during chronic stimulation [ATAC-Seq],GSE240431,Mus musculus,Here， we discovered a reciprocal antagonism between Stat5a and Tox in TEX cells. Stat5a antagonized the Tox-mediated exhaustion program to achieve a durable and protective hybrid effector/NK-like differentiation state in settings that typically drive exhaustion. Stat5 also drove TEX progenitors to differentiate into the effector-like TEXint subset， a key developmental step for PD-1 blockade responsiveness.Therapeutic enhancement of Stat5 activity in TEX cells using an orthogonal IL-2/IL2Rb pair system fostered TEXint cell accumulation and synergized with PD-L1 blockade. Finally， targeted delivery of Stat5-signals in TEX progenitors achieved partial epigenetic rewiring of these cells towards the effector/memory lineage and revived polyfunctionality. Together， these data highlight therapeutic opportunities of targeting Stat5 to antagonize the Tox-dependent epigenetic programming of TEX and provoke a hybrid program that exploits effector biology and durability for optimal therapeutic potential,Three or more replicates from each sample were used for genomic DNA extraction and ATACseq assay was used to compare and analyse the open chromatin data to study the role of STAT5a in Tim3 postive CD8 subset cells,nan,
Pyruvate dehydrogenase fuels a critical citrate pool that is essential for Th17 cell effector functions (RNA-Seq I),GSE222880,Mus musculus,Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the central enzyme connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The importance of PDH function in Th17 cells is unknown. Here， we show that PDH is essential for the generation of a unique glucose-derived citrate pool needed for Th17 cell proliferation， survival and effector function. In vivo， mice harboring a T cell-specific deletion of PDH were less susceptible to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically， the absence of PDH in Th17 cells increased glutaminolysis， glycolysis， and lipid uptake in an mTOR-dependent manner. However， cellular citrate remained critically low in mutant Th17 cells， which interfered with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)， lipid synthesis and histone acetylation crucial for the transcription of Th17 signature genes. Increasing cellular citrate in PDH-deficient Th17 cells restored their metabolism and function， identifying a metabolic feedback loop within central carbon metabolism that may offer possibilities for therapeutically targeting Th17 cell-driven autoimmunity.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Th17 cells with and without PDH knockout with 3 replicates.,36848289,Cell Rep

Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling reveals a self-renewing muscle satellite cell state,GSE199499,Mus musculus,Successful skeletal muscle regeneration is primarily mediated by muscle stem cells or satellite cells which express Pax7. In homeostasis， these satellite cells exist in a âgenuine quiescentâ state， although some satellite cells may also be primed. After an acute injury， satellite cells， enabled by several other niche cells in the muscle tissue， undergo a series of molecular and cellular changes such as activation， proliferation， and differentiation. These processes culminate in the generation of nascent muscle fibers or the restoration of worn-out muscle fibers， leading to the restoration of muscle function. To prevent the depletion of the quiescent satellite cell pool， some satellite cells must resist the ambient differentiation signals and undergo the self-renewal process. While the differentiation process has been well characterized， little is known about the mechanism of satellite cell self-renewal. Furthermore， the molecular identity of self-renewing satellite cells remains unknown. To fill this gap， we utilize single nuclei ATACseq with high temporal resolution to characterize the temporal dynamics of chromatin accessibility in satellite cells and other muscle niche cells during muscle regeneration. This enables us to identify for the first time the self-renewing trajectory undertaken by satellite cells for their long-term repopulation. We also validated these findings using single-cell RNAseq and other protein-level assays. We also utilize gene perturbation to show that SMAD4， a co-SMAD regulating the TGF-beta pathway regulates the cfate choice of self-renewal versus differentiation.,1) Mouse muscle injury (uninjured， 6， 12， 24， 48， 72 hours post injury， 7 days post injury) (2 replicates per sample) and 2) Smad4 f/f:Pax7 CreER/CreER :R26 YFP/YFP mice (i.e.， Smad4 iKO) and Smad4 f/+:Pax7 CreER/CreER:R26 YFP/YFP mice (i.e. Smad4 Ctrl),37382627,J Cell Biol
Utilizing a dual endogenous reporter system to identify functional regulators of aberrant stem cell and differentiation activity in colorectal cancer,GSE236257,Homo sapiens,Aberrant stem cell-like activity and impaired differentiation are central to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). To identify functional mediators that regulate these key cellular programs in CRC， we developed an endogenous reporter system by genome-editing human CRC cell lines with knock-in fluorescent reporters at the SOX9 and KRT20 locus to report aberrant stem cell-like activity and differentiation respectively in pooled CRISPR screening formats. We then constructed a dual reporter system that simultaneously monitors aberrant stem cell-like and differentiation activity in the same CRC cell line， improving our signal to noise discrimination. Using a focused-library CRISPR screen targeting 78 epigenetic regulators with 542 sgRNAs， we identified factors that contribute to stem cell-like activity and differentiation in CRC. Perturbation single cell RNA sequencing (Perturb-seq) of validated hits nominated SMARCB1 of the SWI/SNF BAF complex as a negative regulator of differentiation across an array of neoplastic colon models. SMARCB1 is a dependency in CRC and required for human CRC cell line and patient-derived organoid growth in vivo. These studies highlight the utility of a biologically designed endogenous reporter system to uncover novel therapeutic targets for drug development.,To monitor aberrant stem cell-like (SOX9) and differentiation (KRT20) programs within the same cell in colorectal cancer， we established a dual endogenous reporter cell lines by knocking in fluorescent reporters after marker genes (HT29 SOX9-mKate2/KRT20-GFP) for functional genetic screens. We then compared differential guide abundance using sgRNA read counts in each sorted cell fraction using flow cytometry (mKate2high/GFPhigh， mKate2high/GFPlow， mKate2low/GFPhigh， mKate2low/GFPlow).,38472198,Nat Commun
hMENA isoforms regulate cancer intrinsic Type I IFN signaling and extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in NSCLC [ATAC-seq],GSE224246,Homo sapiens,Understanding how cancer signaling pathways promote an immunosuppressive program which sustains acquired or primary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a crucial step in improving immunotherapy efficacy. Among the pathways that can affect ICB response is the IFN pathway that may be detrimental rather than beneficial. Effects of hMENA11a down-regulation were tested by RNA-Seq， ATAC-Seq， flow cytometry and biochemical assays. ICB treated patient tumor tissues were profiled by Nanostring IO 360 Panel enriched with hMENA custom probes.,The immune sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) induces IFN activation and secretion and is activated by actin cytoskeleton disturbance. The actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein hMENA， along with its isoforms， is a key signaling hub in different solid tumors， and recently its role as a regulator of transcription of genes encoding immunomodulatory secretory proteins has been proposed. When hMENA is expressed in tumor cells with low levels of the epithelial specific hMENA11a isoform， identifies NSCLC patients with poor prognosis. Aim was to identify cancer intrinsic and extrinsic pathways regulated by hMENA11a down-regulation as determinants of ICB response in NSCLC. Herein we present a novel mechanism of ICB resistance driven by hMENA11a down-regulation,37612043,J Immunother Cancer
Bulk RNA seq of WT and TSC2KO mouse mesenchymal vascular progenitors,GSE225656,Mus musculus,To elucidate potential cell-based mechanisms by which deregulation of mTOR signaling in MVPC drives microvessel rarefaction and afore mentioned loss of tissue structure， we isolated eGFP positive MVPC lines by flow sorting  and analyzed their transcriptomic signatures. Unbiased transcriptomic comparison was used to define mechanisms underlying the decreased stemness and angiogenic ability in Tsc2KD mTOR activated versus WT MVPC. Additionally， we identified a Tsc2KD line that exhibited pS6 expression similar to WT levels suggesting cell intrinsic adaptive regulation of mTOR. Bulk RNA seq was performed in triplicate using primary WT， Tsc2KD mTOR regulated and Tsc2KD mTOR activated (mTOR+) lines. Following normalization， hierarchical clustering analyses were presented as a heatmap depicting significant differences in gene expression between WT and Tsc2KD lines.

Harnessing HetHydrogel: An Approach to Single-Cell Multi-Omics,GSE244725,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Developing a single-cell multi-omics technology with mtDNA mutation profiling at its core will enable precise determination of the relationship between mtDNA mutations and cellular phenotypes. To date， the development of permeability-engineered compartmentalization for the isolation and single-cell library preparation of individual cells， which includes Tn5 tagmentation and single-cell barcoding operations in the permeabilized microcapsule format， remains a formidable challenge. Herein， we present a approach for single-cell mitochondrial analysis， harnessing microfluidics to generate heterogeneous hydrogels as artificial membranes. These hydrogels serve to regulate the passage of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genomes subsequent to the cell lysis step. This approach enables high-throughput mitochondrial DNA genotyping and accessible chromatin profiling at the single-cell level， significantly enhancing the capabilities of permeability-engineered compartmentalization.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of cell retention and the selective permeability of the capsule reaction system， optimizing conditions for cell lysis， Tn5 tagmentation， and barcode labeling. Validation experiments were performed using Human 293T and Mouse 3T3 cells to assess identification and quantification performance. Our method offers a new strategy for the study of the functions of various mtDNA mutations in biological processes， while also offering a new system for the construction of single-cell multi-omics libraries.,To assess the impact of different lysis conditions on sequencing data， we performed Tn5 tagmentation-based library preparation on 293T cells encapsulated in hydrogel using fragmentation buffers 1-4.To investigate single-cell library preparation within hydrogel matrices， we conducted scATAC-seq experiments on intact 293T cells and intact 3T3 cells encapsulated in hydrogels.,nan,
ATAC-seq of isogenicHIV-1 infected Jurkat T cell lines,GSE229927,Homo sapiens,HIV-1 integration introduces ectopic transcription factor binding sites into host chromatin. We postulate that the integrated provirus serves as an ectopic enhancer that recruits additional transcriptional factors to the integration locus， increases chromatin accessibility， changes 3D chromatin interactions， and enhances both retroviral and host gene expression. We used 4 well-characterized HIV-1-infected cell line clones having unique integration sites and low to high levels of HIV-1 expression. Using single-cell DOGMA-seq， which captured the heterogeneity of HIV-1 expression and host chromatin accessibility， we found that HIV-1 transcription correlated with HIV-1 accessibility and host chromatin accessibility. HIV-1 integration increased local host chromatin accessibility within ~5â30 kb distance. CRISPRa and CRISPRi-mediated HIV-1 promoter activation and inhibition confirmed integration site-dependent HIV-1-driven changes of host chromatin accessibility. HIV-1 did not drive chromatin confirmation changes at the genomic level (by Hi-C) or the enhancer connectome (by H3K27Ac HiChIP). Using 4C-seq to interrogate HIV-1-chromatin interactions， we found that HIV-1 interacted with host chromatin ~100â300 kb from the integration site. By identifying chromatin regions having both increased transcription factor activity (by ATAC-seq) and HIV-1-chromtain interaction (by 4C-seq)， we identified enrichment of ETS， RUNT， STAT， and ZNF transcription factor binding that may mediate HIV-1-host chromatin interactions. Our study found that HIV-1 promoter activity increased host chromatin accessibility， increased HIV-1-host chromatin interactions in an integration site dependent manner， within the existing chromatin boundaries without impacting broader host chromatin structure.,Unstimulated Jurkat CD4+ T cells with or without an HIV-1 provirus were profiled.,37295842,Genome Res
Metabolic reprogramming from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis in a patient mutation knock-in mouse model ofÂ Barth Syndrome.[mouse],GSE221662,Mus musculus,Mitochondria are central for cellular metabolism and energy supply. Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is a severe disorder due to dysfunction of the mitochondrial cardiolipin acyl transferase tafazzin. Altered cardiolipin remodeling affects mitochondrial inner membrane organization and function of membrane proteins such as transporters and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Here， we describe a mouse model that carries a G197V exchange in tafazzin， corresponding to BTHS patient. TAZG197V mice recapitulate disease-specific pathology including cardiac dysfunction and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. We show that mutant mitochondria display defective fatty acid driven oxidative phosphorylation due to reduced levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferases. A metabolic switch in ATP production from OXPHOS to glycolysis is apparent in mouse heart and patient iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes. An increase in glycolytic ATP production inactivates AMPK causing altered metabolic signaling in TAZG197V. Treatment of mutant cells with AMPK activator reestablishes fatty acid driven OXPHOS and protects mice against cardiac failure.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for WT and TAZG197V mouse hearts.,37533404,EMBO Mol Med
Differential voluntary feed intake and whole transcriptome profiling in the hypothalamus of young sheep offered crude protein and phosphorus deficient diets,GSE221072,Ovis aries,A reduction in voluntary feed intake is observed in ruminants consuming nutrient deficient diets， such as those with a low CP or P content， and has been attributed to active metabolic regulation， rather than a physical constraint. The hypothalamus is the key integrator of feed intake regulation in mammals. The objectives of this experiment were to 1) establish a model of metabolic feed intake regulation in ruminants consuming diets of variable CP and P content， and 2) determine key biochemical pathways and influential points of regulation within the hypothalamus. Merino wethers [n = 40; 23.7 Â± 1.4 kg liveweight (mean Â± SD)] were fed one of five dietary treatments (n = 8/treatment) for 63 days in individual pens. The treatments included targeted combinations of high (H) and low (L) CP (110 and 55 g/kg DM) and high and low P (2.5 and 0.7 g/kg DM) with 9 MJ metabolisable energy (ME) per kg DM which were fed ad libitum (UMEI; unrestricted ME intake) resulting in four experimental diets (HCP-HP-UMEI， LCP-HP-UMEI， HCP-LP-UMEI and LCP-LP-UMEI). An additional nutritional treatment (HCP-HP-RMEI) restricted intake of the HCP-HP diet to an equivalent ME intake of wethers consuming the LCP-LP-UMEI treatment. Wethers offered the LCP-HP-UMEI， HCP-LP-UMEI and LCP-LP-UMEI treatments consumed 42， 32 and 49% less total DM (P â¤ 0.05)， respectively than the HCP-HP-UMEI treatment， and this was not attributable to any physical limitation of the rumen. Plasma concentrations of urea nitrogen and inorganic phosphate indicated that these nutrient deficiencies were successfully established. To assess potential mechanisms， RNA-seq was conducted on samples from the arcuate nucleus (ARC)， ventromedial hypothalamus and lateral hypothalamus of the wethers， yielding a total of 301， 8 and 148 differentially expressed genes across all pairwise comparisons， respectively. The expression of NPY， AGRP and CARTPT， known for their regulatory role in mammalian feed intake regulation， had a similar transcriptional response in the ARC of wethers consuming nutrient deficient treatments and those consuming a ME restricted treatment， despite these wethers expressing behaviours indicative of satiated and hungry states， respectively. In addition， genes involved with glycolysis (TPI1)， the citric acid cycle (CS， OGDH， GLUD1， GOT1) and oxidative phosphorylation (COX5A， ATP5MC1， ATP5F1B， ATP5MC3) were downregulated in the ARC of wethers fed a nutrient deficient (LCP-LP-UMEI) relative to the non-deficient (HCP-HP-UMEI) treatment. In summary， a model for voluntary feed intake restriction was established to determine genome-wide molecular changes in the hypothalamus of young ruminants.,Tissue samples collected from the arcuate nucleus (ARC)， lateral hypothalmus (LHA) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of 40 Merino sheep (7 months old) fed one of five dietary treatments (n = 8/treatment) for 63 days. Sample ARC_35 was not sequenced and is not included.,37738703,Animal
Targeting KAT6A/KAT6B dependencies in breast cancer with a novel selective， orally bioavailable KAT6 inhibitor， CTx-648/PF-9363 [ATAC-Seq],GSE233784,Homo sapiens,KAT6A， and its paralog KAT6B， are histone lysine acetyltransferases (HAT) that acetylate histone H3K23 and regulate diverse biological processes including transcription， cell-cycle progression， and stem cell development.  KAT6A exerts an oncogenic role in several tumor types including breast cancer where it is amplified in 10-15% of patients. However， pharmacologic targeting of KAT6A to achieve therapeutic benefit has been a challenge. Here we describe identification of a highly potent， selective and orally bioavailable KAT6A/KAT6B inhibitor CTx-648 (PF-9363)， derived from a novel benzisoxazole series， which demonstrates anti-tumor activity in correlation with H3K23Ac inhibition in KAT6A over-expressing breast cancer. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling studies show reduced RNA Pol II binding and downregulation of genes involved in estrogen signaling， cell cycle and stem cell pathways associated with CTx-648 anti-tumor activity in ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer. CTx-648 treatment leads to potent tumor growth inhibition in ER+ breast cancer in vivo models， including models refractory to endocrine therapy， highlighting the potential for targeting KAT6A in ER+ breast cancer.,Human breast cancer cell lines were treated with DMSO or 30 nM PF9363 for 2 or 5 days in triplicates， and subjected to ATAC-seq analysis,37557181,Cell Chem Biol
Transcriptional Regulation of Sunflower Heliotropism and Phototropism,GSE229654,Helianthus annuus,Sunflowers are famous for their ability to track the sun throughout the day， and then reorient at night to face east the following morning. This process， termed heliotropism， is generally believed to be a specialized form of phototropism; however， the underlying mechanism is unknown. To better understand heliotropism we used RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional profiles of sunflower stems during heliotropism， and blue light-induced phototropism.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data from stem tissue of sunflowers undergoing either phototropism or heliotropism.,37906610,PLoS Biol
Simultaneous profiling of chromatin architecture and transcription in single cells,GSE211395,Mus musculus,Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure plays a crucial role in development and diseases， which are associated with transcriptional changes. However， given the heterogeneity in single-cell chromatin architecture and transcription， the regulatory relationship between 3D chromatin structure and gene expression is difficult to explain based on the cell populations. Here we developed a single-cell multimodal omics method for simultaneously detecting chromatin architecture and mRNA expression by sequencing (scCARE-seq). Applying scCARE-seq to examine chromatin architecture and transcription from naÃ¯ve to primed single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)， we observed correlated changes between 3D chromatin structure and expression in the cell fate transition. In addition， we defined cell cycle phase of each cell through chromatin architecture extracted by CARE-seq， and found that periodic changes in chromatin architecture were in parallel with transcription during the cell cycle. These findings indicate that scCARE-seq allows comprehensive analysis of chromatin architecture and transcription in the same single cell.,chromatin architecture and gene expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,37580628,Nat Struct Mol Biol

A novel type of monocytic leukemia stem cell revealed by the clinical use of venetoclax-based therapy,GSE232559,Homo sapiens,Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease on both inter- and intra-patient levels. In many patients， relapse is driven by a relatively small pool of Leukemia Stem Cells (LSCs) that are able to resist therapeutic perturbation and drive proliferation of the malignant AML blast pool. Due to the low frequency of LSCs and high degree of heterogeneity between and within patients， inspecting these specimens at the single cell level is critical to identifying the true relapse driving cells and tailoring therapies towards these cells.,We performed CITE-seq on primary AML patient specimens derived from either peripheral blood or bone marrow to capture single cell transcriptomics and surface protein expression.,37358260,Cancer Discov
Study of the protective effect of D-Lactate-producing probiotics on CNS pathology,GSE188503,Mus musculus,Dendritic cells (DCs) control the generation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells. Thus， DCs are attractive therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. Using single-cell and bulk transcriptional and metabolic analyses in combination with cell-specific gene perturbation studies we identified a negative feedback regulatory pathway that operates in DCs to limit immunopathology. Specifically， we found that lactate， produced by activated DCs and other immune cells， boosts NDUFA4L2 expression through a mechanism mediated by HIF-1a. NDUFA4L2 promotes mitochondrial fitness in DCs， limiting the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that activate XBP1-driven transcriptional modules involved in the control of pathogenic autoimmune T cells. Moreover， we engineered a probiotic that produces lactate and suppresses T-cell autoimmunity in the central nervous system via the activation of HIF-1a/NDUFA4L2 signaling in DCs. In summary， we identified a novel immunometabolic pathway that regulates DC function， and developed a synthetic probiotic for its therapeutic activation via the gut-brain axis.,WT and Itgax Cre HIF1a flox mice were treated with D-Lactate-producing bacteria starting 3 days before EAE induction and DCs were sorted at endpoint,37558878,Nature
Foreign RNA spike-ins enable accurate allele-specific expression analysis at scale [I],GSE228002,Caenorhabditis elegans;Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Analysis of allele-specific expression is strongly affected by the technical noise present in RNA-seq experiments. Previously， we showed that technical replicates can be used for precise estimates of this noise， and we provided a tool for correction of technical noise in allele-specific expression analysis. This approach is very accurate but costly due to the need for two or more replicates of each library. Here， we develop a spike-in approach that is highly accurate at only a small fraction of the cost.We show that a distinct RNA added as a spike-in before library preparation reflects technical noise of the whole library and can be used in large batches of samples. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using combinations of RNA from species distinguishable by alignment， namely， mouse， human， and C.elegans. Our new approach， controlFreq， enables highly accurate and computationally efficient analysis of allele-specific expression in (and between) arbitrarily large studies at an overall cost increase of â¼ 5%.,Comparative allele-specific expression analysis of RNA-seq data with foreign RNA spike-ins (mixes of human， mouse and C.elegans).,37387154,Bioinformatics
Massively parallel functional dissection of schizophrenia associated non-coding genetic variants [scRNA-seq],GSE225814,Homo sapiens,Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly polygenic disease and genome wide association studies have identified thousands of genetic variants that are statistically associated with this psychiatric disorder. However， our ability to translate these associations into insights on the disease mechanisms has been challenging since the causal genetic variants， their molecular function and their target genes remain largely unknown. In order to address these questions， we established a functional genomics pipeline in combination with induced pluripotent stem cell technology to functionally characterize 35，000 non-coding genetic variants associated with schizophrenia along with their target genes. This analysis identified a set of 620 (1.7%) single nucleotide polymorphisms as functional on a molecular level in a highly cell type and condition specific fashion. These results provide a high-resolution map of functional variant-gene combinations and offer comprehensive biological insights into the developmental context and stimulation dependent molecular processes modulated by SCZ associated genetic variation.,We performed a CROP-Seq screen for gene regulatory elements in iPSC derived neurons using an engineered dCas9-KRAB cell line and a guide RNA library followed by scRNA-Seq,nan,
Analyses of HIF-1a-deficient DCs in the context of pre-clinical model of Multiple Sclerosis， Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomielitis (EAE),GSE188499,Mus musculus,Dendritic cells (DCs) control the generation of self-reactive pathogenic T cells.

Inhibition of topoisomerase 1 and BRD4-mediated pause release selectively kills tumours by inducing readthrough transcription [SLAM-seq],GSE211469,Homo sapiens,Transcription inhibition has become an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy because many cancers arise from dysregulated transcription programs. Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) coordinate each other to regulate transcriptional elongation. Using a collection of patient-derived xenograft mouse models of pancreatic cancer we show that the combined inhibition of TOP1 and BRD4 is synergistic in arresting tumor growth. We link this effect to the ability of TOP1 and BRD4 to control pause-release， a rate-limiting step in early elongation. By comparing nascent transcripts with the recruitment of elongation and termination factors along genes， we found that combined inhibition of TOP1 and BRD4， while globally impairing RNA production， also disturbs the recruitment of proteins involved in termination. Thus， RNA polymerases stay engaged with the DNA downstream of polyadenylation sites for hundreds of kilobases leading to readthrough-transcription. Because this pervasive transcription occurs also during replication， it perturbs replisome progression leading to increased DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. The synergistic effect of TOP1 and BRD4 inhibition is specific for the tumor cells as negligible transcriptional defects are observed in non-tumor cells. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the benefit of combining TOP1 and BRD4 inhibitors in the treatment of highly transcription- and replication-driven tumors.,RNA-seq with extracts from Bo103 cells.,37831776,Sci Adv

A Pancreas Organoids-based Screen Identifies a Specific KRAS Mutation Inhibitor that Attenuating Cholesterol Biosynthesis Pathway in Pancreatic Cancer,GSE207352,Mus musculus,we reported a high-content drug screening platform of a series of pancreas organoids which contain common mutations found in human pancreatic cancer， wide type (WT)， KC (KRASG12D)， KPC (KRASG12D; Tp53R172H)， KSC (KRASG12D; SMAD4-/-) and KPSC (KRASG12D; Tp53R172H and SMAD4-/-). Based on this platform， we screened about 6000 compounds and identified Perhexiline， which can inhibit the growth of pancreas organoids with KRAS mutation in vitro and in vivo. Single cell RNA-seq data shows that the cholesterol synthesis pathway is activated specifically caused by KRAS in mutated organoid lines. The key cholesterol synthesis regulator of SREBP2 and its downstream genes are activated in KRAS mutated organoids compared with WT. Interestingly， Perhexiline can reverse the metabolism changes in pancreas organoids with KRAS through downregulating SREBP2 at transcription level. Finally， we further validated targeting SREBP2 can attenuate tumor growth significantly with chemical inhibitor and genetic perturbation. These findings boost further understanding of KRAS in PDAC and provide a valuable resource for targeting KRAS therapeutics development.,Five kinds of pancreas organoids， wide type (WT)， KC (KRASG12D)， KPC (KRASG12D; Tp53R172H)， KSC (KRASG12D; SMAD4-/-) and KPSC (KRASG12D; Tp53R172H and SMAD4-/-) were treated with or without perhexiline.

In vitro grown organoids treated with IFNÎ³ mimicking in vivo intestinal crypts cells aging,GSE174297,Mus musculus,Aging-related intestinal dysfunctions include loss of barrier integrity， altered stress responses， nutrient malabsorption， and cancer formation. Influence of aging on intestinal stem cell (ISC) and their niches can explain underlying causes for perturbation in ISC function during aging. However， molecular mechanisms for such decrease in functionality of ISCs during aging remain largely undetermined. Using different transcriptome-wide approaches including single-cell RNA-seq from intestinal crypt cells and immune cells of lamina propria， we characterized age-specific transcriptional programs in the intestinal epithelium. We found that aged ISCs strongly upregulate antigen presenting pathway genes and over-express secretory lineage marker genes leading to a compromised homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. Mechanistically， increase of interferon gamma (IFNgamma) release by cytotoxic CD4 T cells and innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2) in lamina propria of aged intestine lead to induction of Stat1 in ISCs that trigger MHC class II expression and prime them towards a secretory fate. Altogether these findings， clarify the cross talk between immune cells and ISC in aged intestine and identified the IFNgamma-Stat1-MHCII axis as the key gene network driving intestinal inflammaging phenotype and loss of tissue homeostasis.

RNAseq of VP882 phage activation in V. cholerae,GSE247770,Vibrio cholerae,Many， if not all， bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to control gene expression and collective behaviours， and more recently QS has also been discovered in bacteriophages (phages). Phages can produce communication molecules of their own， or âlisten inâ on the hostâs communication processes， in order to switch between lytic and lysogenic modes of infection. In this project， we studied the interaction of Vibrio cholerae， the causative agent of cholera disease， with the lysogenic vibriophage VP882. The lytic cycle of VP882 is induced by the QS molecule DPO (3，5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol)， however， the global regulatory consequences of DPO-mediated VP882 activation have remained unclear.,To investigate the transcriptional changes upon VP882 activation， V. cholerae âtdh + JSP-1269 (VP882::kanR) were cultivated in M9 medium to OD600 of 0.2 and VP882 phage was activated by 25 ÂµM DPO and 0.035% arabinose to induce the lytic cycle. Cells were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Three biological replicates for each condition are provided. To identify transcriptional start sites (TSS) of the VP882 phage， RNA samples of each time point were pooled and treated with terminator exonuclease to enrich primary transcripts.,nan,
Cell-matrix interactions control biliary organoids polarity，architecture  and differentiation and can be exploited to improve modelling of biliary diseases [scRNA-seq],GSE204959,Homo sapiens,Diseases of the biliary epithelium (cholangiopathies) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Their pathogenesis and treatment remain unclear， in part because of the lack of disease models relevant to humans. 3D biliary organoids hold great promise， however the inaccessibility of their apical pole， and the presence of extracellular matrix (EBM) limit their experimental application. Here we show that when b integrin signaling is inhibited， either by removing the EMC or using blocking antibodies， biliary organoids revert their polarity and expose the apical membrane. Functional， immunohistochemical and TEM studies， along with bulk and single cell transcriptomic demonstrate that organoids in this novel 3D configuration， are less heterogeneous， show increased biliary differentiation， and decreased expression of stem cell markers. This model can be used to study bile transport， interactions with microbial agents， epithelial permeability， cross-talk with other liver and immune cell types and the effect of matrix changes on the biliary epithelium.,Liver organoids were generated from liver explants (n=4) and were cultured embedded in the ECM (EMB) or suspended in ECM/media mix (10% BME) or without ECM.,36972396,Hepatol Commun
Transient naive reprogramming corrects hiPS cells functionally and epigenetically [scRNA-Seq],GSE246103,Homo sapiens,Cells undergo a major epigenome reconfiguration when reprogrammed to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). However， the epigenomes of hiPS cells and human embryonic stem (hES) cells differ significantly， which affects hiPS cell function. These differences include epigenetic memory and aberrations that emerge during reprogramming， for which the mechanisms remain unknown. Here we characterized the persistence and emergence of these epigenetic differences by performing genome-wide DNA methylation profiling throughout primed and naive reprogramming of human somatic cells to hiPS cells. We found that reprogramming-induced epigenetic aberrations emerge midway through primed reprogramming， whereas DNA demethylation begins early in naive reprogramming. Using this knowledge， we developed a transient-naive-treatment (TNT) reprogramming strategy that emulates the embryonic epigenetic reset. We show that the epigenetic memory in hiPS cells is concentrated in cell of origin-dependent repressive chromatin marked by H3K9me3， lamin-B1 and aberrant CpH methylation. TNT reprogramming reconfigures these domains to a hES cell-like state and does not disrupt genomic imprinting. Using an isogenic system， we demonstrate that TNT reprogramming can correct the transposable element overexpression and differential gene expression seen in conventional hiPS cells， and that TNT-reprogrammed hiPS and hES cells show similar differentiation efficiencies. Moreover， TNT reprogramming enhances the differentiation of hiPS cells derived from multiple cell types. Thus， TNT reprogramming corrects epigenetic memory and aberrations， producing hiPS cells that are molecularly and functionally more similar to hES cells than conventional hiPS cells. We foresee TNT reprogramming becoming a new standard for biomedical and therapeutic applications and providing a novel system for studying epigenetic memory.,10X Genomics 3prime v3,37587336,Nature
Transgene directed induction of a human embryo model from pluripotent stem cells,GSE218314,Homo sapiens,The human embryo undergoes morphogenetic transformations following implantation into the uterus and yet our knowledge of this crucial stage is limited by the inability to observe the embryoÂ in vivo. Here， we establish a stem cell-derived human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Overexpression of the transcription factors GATA6 and SOX17 or GATA3 and AP2g in hESCs allowed us to generate hypoblast-like and trophoblast-like cells， respectively. We established conditions to combine these extraembryonic-like cells with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These aggregates contain an inner pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by both hypoblast- and trophoblast-like tissues. We show that this human embryo stem cell model robustly generates several cell types， including amnion-， extraembryonic mesenchyme- and primordial germ cell-like cells. Using perturbation experiments， we demonstrated that these populations arise in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that these extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation， highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion， this modular， tractable model of the human embryo that includes both embryonic- and extraembryonic-like cells has the potential to probe key questions of human post-implantation development.,single cell 10x multiome (RNA+ATAC) sequencing on transgene-directed human embryo models.,37369347,Nature

Somatic mouse models of gastric cancer reveal genotype-specific features of metastatic disease,GSE199261,Mus musculus,Metastatic gastric carcinoma is a highly lethal cancer that responds poorly to conventional and molecularly targeted therapies. Despite its clinical relevance， the mechanisms underlying the behavior and therapeutic response of this disease are poorly understood owing， in part， to a paucity of tractable models that faithfully recapitulate different subtypes of the human disease. To close this gap， we developed methods to somatically introduce different oncogenic lesions directly into the stomach epithelium and show that genotypic configurations observed in patients produce metastatic gastric cancers that recapitulate the histological， molecular， and clinical features of all non-viral molecular subtypes of the human disease. Applying this platform to both wild-type and immune-deficient mice revealed previously unappreciated links between the genotype， organotropism and immune surveillance of metastatic cells that produced distinct patterns of metastasis that were mirrored in patients. Our results establish and credential a highly portable platform for producing autochthonous cancer models with flexible genotypes and host backgrounds， which can unravel mechanisms of gastric tumorigenesis or test new therapeutic concepts aimed at improving outcomes in gastric cancer patients.,For RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptional profiles of MYC-p53， MYC-Apc and MYC-p53-Msh2 EPO-GEMM gastric tumors， as well as normal stomach of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice， total RNA was extracted from bulk tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Purified polyA mRNA was subsequently fragmented， and first and second strand cDNA synthesis performed using standard Illumina mRNA TruSeq library preparation protocols. Double stranded cDNA was subsequently processed for TruSeq dual-index Illumina library generation.,38177458,Nat Cancer
New Chromatin Run-On Reaction Enables Global Mapping of Active RNA Polymerase Locations in an Enrichment-free Manner,GSE160073,Homo sapiens,The status of cellular RNA polymerasesâ locations mirrors global transcriptional activity. A number of methods have been developed to map the distribution of RNA polymerase II (RNPII) genomewide， most of which took advantages of im-munoprecipitations of RNPII complexes or nucleotide analog-labeled nascent RNAs followed by high-throughput sequenc-ing. Given the tedious procedures involved in enrichment and sequencing library construction experiments， development of a simple method that conquers these issues is highly beneficial to the field. Here we report a mutation-based and enrich-ment-free Global chromatin Run-On sequencing (mGRO-seq) technique to map strand-specific RNPII locations ge-nomewide at near base resolution. An ATP analog， named N6-allyladenosine triphosphate (a6ATP)， was designed and incor-porated into nascent RNAs at RNPII-located positions during a chromatin run-on assay. The chromatin RNAs were purified and subjected to a mild iodination reaction， which quantitatively transformed a6A into 1，N6-cyclized adenosine (cyc-A). During reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA)， base misincorporation at opposite site of cyc-A oc-curred and mutation reads were generated in the cDNA high-throughput sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis identified the genomewide RNPII location distributions from the characteristic A-mutated sites. mGRO-seq yields both the profile of RNPII sites and the chromatin RNA abundance from one experiment. To sum up， our work demonstrated a new simple and cost-effective method for mapping RNA polymerase locations genomewide， which holds great promise for single-cell char-acterization of RNPII distributions.,Identification of RNA polymerase active sites in HeLa cell line using mGRO-seq method.,35302367,ACS Chem Biol

hMENA isoforms regulate cancer intrinsic Type I IFN signaling and extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in NSCLC [RNA-seq],GSE224216,Homo sapiens,Understanding how cancer signaling pathways promote an immunosuppressive program which sustains acquired or primary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a crucial step in improving immunotherapy efficacy. Among the pathways that can affect ICB response is the IFN pathway that may be detrimental rather than beneficial. Effects of hMENA11a down-regulation were tested by RNA-Seq， ATAC-Seq， flow cytometry and biochemical assays. ICB treated patient tumor tissues were profiled by Nanostring IO 360 Panel enriched with hMENA custom probes.,The immune sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) induces IFN activation and secretion and is activated by actin cytoskeleton disturbance. The actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein hMENA， along with its isoforms， is a key signaling hub in different solid tumors， and recently its role as a regulator of transcription of genes encoding immunomodulatory secretory proteins has been proposed. When hMENA is expressed in tumor cells with low levels of the epithelial specific hMENA11a isoform， identifies NSCLC patients with poor prognosis. Aim was to identify cancer intrinsic and extrinsic pathways regulated by hMENA11a down-regulation as determinants of ICB response in NSCLC. Herein we present a novel mechanism of ICB resistance driven by hMENA11a down-regulation,37612043,J Immunother Cancer

High-throughput Single-cell Profiling of B cell Responses Following Inactivated Influenza Vaccination in Young and Older Adults (single-cell BCR),GSE175523,Homo sapiens,Seasonal influenza contributes to a substantial disease burden annually， resulting in approximately 10 million hospital visits and 50 thousand deaths in a typical year in the US. 90% of the annual mortality from influenza occurs in people over the age of 65. While influenza vaccination is the best protection against the virus， it is less effective for the elderly. This may be due to differences in the quantity or type of B cells induced by vaccination in older individuals. To investigate this possibility， we leveraged recent development in single-cell technology that allows for simultaneous measurement of both gene expression profile and the B cell receptor (BCR) at single-cell resolution. Pre- and post-vaccination peripheral blood B cells were sorted from three young and three older adults who responded to the inactivated influenza vaccine and were profiled using single-cell RNAseq with paired BCR sequencing. At pre-vaccination， we observed a higher somatic hypermutation frequency and a higher abundance of activated B cells in older adults than in young adults. Following vaccination， young adults mounted a more clonal response than older adults. The response involved a mix of plasmablasts， activated B cells， and resting memory B cells in both age groups. The response in young adults was dominated by expansion in plasmablasts， while the response in older adults also involved activated B cells. We observed a consistent change in gene expression in plasmablasts after vaccination between age groups but not in the activated B cells. These quantitative and qualitative differences in the B cell response may provide insights into the age-related change of influenza vaccination response.,To understand the age-group difference in B cells underlying a successful vaccination response， we selected three young (20- to 30-years-old) and three older (60- to 100-years-old) subjects who responded to seasonal influenza vaccine with at least 4 fold increase of HAI titer for at least one vaccine strain from a cohort recruited at Yale University over the five vaccination seasons between 2010 and 2014.,37367734,Aging (Albany NY)
Droplet-based forward genetic screening of astrocyte-microglia communication mechanisms,GSE218732,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,SPEACC-seq is a novel high-throughput method which enables forward genetic screens to identify cell-cell interaction mechanisms that uncovered an astrocyte-microglia regulatory circuit mediated by amphiregulin and IL33-ST2. signaling. Cell-cell interactions in the central nervous system (CNS) play central roles in neurologic diseases. However， little is known about the specific molecular pathways involved， and methods for their systematic identification are limited. For example， several factors mediate microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathology， but less is known about regulatory interactions that limit tissue pathology. Here we report the development of SPEACC-seq (Stimulation， Perturbation， and Encapsulation of interACting Cells followed by Sequencing)， a forward genetic screening platform which combines genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations， cell co-culture in picoliter droplets， and microfluidic-based fluorescence activated droplet sorting to identify mechanisms of cell-cell communication. Using SPEACC-seq in combination with an in vivo perturb-seq screen， we identified microglia-produced amphiregulin as a suppressor of disease promoting astrocyte responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)， a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The production of microglial amphiregulin was induced via ST2 signaling by IL-33 released from astrocytes during EAE. Indeed， the genetic inactivation of ST2 or amphiregulin in microglia， or IL-33 or amphiregulin signaling in astrocytes resulted in the worsening of EAE， suggesting that IL-33-induced microglial amphiregulin limits disease-promoting astrocyte responses associated with CNS pathology. This regulatory loop was also detected in human astrocytes and microglia both in vitro and in MS patient CNS samples. In summary， we developed SPEACC-seq， a high-throughput， droplet-based forward genetic screening platform for the identification of cell-cell interaction mechanisms， which identified a novel microglia-astrocyte negative feedback loop that limits CNS pathology.,Studying the effects of AREG， IL-33， and ST2 in astroyctes and microglia in vivo and in vitro.,nan,
GiRAFR improves gRNA detection and annotation in single cell CRISPR screens,GSE216040,Homo sapiens,Novel single cell RNA-seq analysis combined with CRISPR screens enables the high- throughput characterization of transcriptional changes caused by genetic perturbations. Dedicated software to annotate CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) libraries and associate them with single cell transcriptomes are however lacking. Here， we generated a CRISPR droplet sequencing dataset. We demonstrate that the current default tool fails to detect mutant gRNAs. We therefore developed GiRAFR， a pysam-based software tool to characterize intact and mutant gRNAs. We show that mutant gRNAs are dysfunctional， and failure to detect and annotate them leads to an inflated estimate of the number of untransformed cells as well as an underestimated multiplet frequency. These findings are mirrored in publicly available datasets， where we find that up to 34 % of cells are transduced with a mutant gRNA. Applying GiRAFR hence stands to improve the annotation and quality of single cell CRISPR screens.,We transformed A549 cells expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cas9 with a lentiviral pool for expression of 120 gRNAs at low multiplicity of infection. After stringent selection using puromycin and 2 days of Cas9 induction， cells were allowed to grow for another 5 days.,37741886,Commun Biol

Decoding of translation-regulating entities reveals heterogeneous translation deficiency patterns in cellular senescence,GSE225095,Homo sapiens,Cellular senescence constitutes a generally irreversible proliferation barrier， accompanied by macromolecular damage and metabolic rewiring. Several senescence types have been identified based on the initiating stimulus， such as replicative (RS)， stress-induced (SIS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Reduced protein synthesis is considered a senescence hallmark， but whether this trait pertains to various senescence subtypes and if distinct molecular mechanisms are involved remain largely unknown. Here， we analyze large published or experimentally produced RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets to determine whether major translation-regulating entities such as ribosome stalling， the presence of uORFs/dORFs and IRES elements may differentially contribute to translation deficiency in senescence subsets. We show that translation-regulating mechanisms may not be directly relevant to RS， however uORFs are significantly enriched in SIS. Interestingly， ribosome stalling， uORF/dORF patterns and IRES elements comprise predominant mechanisms upon OIS， strongly correlating with Notch pathway activation. Our study provides for the first time evidence that major translation dysregulation mechanisms/patterns occur during cellular senescence， but at different rates depending on the stimulus type. The degree at which those mechanisms accumulate directly correlates with translation deficiency levels. Our thorough analysis contributes to elucidating crucial and so far unknown differences in the translation machinery and ribosome biogenesis between senescence subsets.,Translation efficiency changes upon different senescent stimuli versus normal proliferating conditions in IMR 90 cell line,37547972,Aging Cell

Inhibition of topoisomerase 1 and BRD4-mediated pause release selectively kills tumours by inducing readthrough transcription [CAD-seq],GSE211465,Homo sapiens,Transcription inhibition has become an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy because many cancers arise from dysregulated transcription programs. Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) coordinate each other to regulate transcriptional elongation. Using a collection of patient-derived xenograft mouse models of pancreatic cancer we show that the combined inhibition of TOP1 and BRD4 is synergistic in arresting tumor growth. We link this effect to the ability of TOP1 and BRD4 to control pause-release， a rate-limiting step in early elongation. By comparing nascent transcripts with the recruitment of elongation and termination factors along genes， we found that combined inhibition of TOP1 and BRD4， while globally impairing RNA production， also disturbs the recruitment of proteins involved in termination. Thus， RNA polymerases stay engaged with the DNA downstream of polyadenylation sites for hundreds of kilobases leading to readthrough-transcription. Because this pervasive transcription occurs also during replication， it perturbs replisome progression leading to increased DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. The synergistic effect of TOP1 and BRD4 inhibition is specific for the tumor cells as negligible transcriptional defects are observed in non-tumor cells. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the benefit of combining TOP1 and BRD4 inhibitors in the treatment of highly transcription- and replication-driven tumors.,Covalent adduct detection coupled to sequencing (CAD-seq) in bo103 cells for Topoisomerase1 (TOP1) in duplicates.,37831776,Sci Adv
A cell state specific metabolic vulnerability to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis in glioblastoma,GSE224727,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Glioma cells hijack developmental transcriptional programs to control cell state. During neural development， lineage trajectories rely on specialized metabolic pathways. However， the link between tumor cell state and metabolic programs is poorly understood in glioma. Here we uncover a glioma cell state-specific metabolic liability that can be leveraged therapeutically. To model the diversity of glioma cell states， we generated genetically-engineered murine gliomas， induced by deletion of p53 alone (p53) or with constitutively active Notch signaling (N1IC)， a pathway critical in controlling CNS cell fate. N1IC tumors harbored quiescent astrocyte-like transformed cell states while p53 tumors were comprised of proliferating progenitor-like cell states. N1IC cells exhibit distinct metabolic alterations， with mitochondrial uncoupling and increased ROS production rendering them more sensitive to inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 and induction of ferroptosis. Importantly， treating patient-derived organotypic slices with a GPX4 inhibitor induced selective depletion of quiescent AC-like glioma cell populations with similar metabolic profiles.,Mouse brain tumors and treated patient-derived tissue slices were dissociated for scRNA-seq analysis,36865302,bioRxiv
Modeling the nascent RNA transcriptome with chrTT-seq to extract chromatin dissociation dynamics on newly transcribed RNA.,GSE218726,Homo sapiens,To capture chromatin dissociation dynamics of nascent RNA transcripts we labeled MCF-7 cells with 4-thio-uridine (4-SU) for 8 minutes， then chased with an excess of uridine for 5， 10， 15 and 20 min. At each pulse-chase time point we performed TT-seq from the chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic fraction.The ratios of spike-in normalized chromatin-associated to chromatin-released nascent RNA read coverage over genomic features (transcripts' last exons) were fitted on an exponential decay function to extract an estimated chromatin association half-live time for each transcript.,Briefly， chromatin fractionation was performed at 0.5 M urea. RNA was extracted with acidic phenol from the chromatin-associated and chromatin-released fraction， and chemically fragmented (0.1 M NaOH on ice) before 4-SU based purification of newly transcribed RNA. A mix of three 4SU-labeled and three unlabeled ERCC spike-ins were added to RNA prior to fragmentation.

BATF represses BIM to sustain tolerant T cells in the periphery (ATAC-Seq),GSE244276,Mus musculus,T cells that encounter self-antigens after exiting the thymus avert autoimmunity through peripheral tolerance. Pathways for this include an unresponsive state known as anergy， clonal deletion， and T regulatory (Treg) cell induction. The transcription factor cues and kinetics that guide distinct peripheral tolerance outcomes remain unclear. Here， we found that anergic T cells are epigenetically primed for regulation by the non-classical AP-1 family member BATF. Tolerized BATF-deficient CD4+ T cells were resistant to anergy induction and instead underwent clonal deletion due to pro-apoptotic BIM (Bcl2l11) upregulation. During prolonged antigen exposure， BIM de-repression resulted in fewer PD-1+ conventional T cells as well as loss of peripherally-induced FOXP3+ Treg cells. Simultaneous Batf and Bcl2l11 knockdown meanwhile restored anergic T cell survival and Treg cell maintenance. The data identify the AP-1 nuclear factor BATF as a dominant driver of sustained T cell anergy and illustrate a mechanism for divergent peripheral tolerance fates.,A combination of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq was used to interrogate freshly isolated spleen and lymph node polyclonal CD4 T cell subsets (Anergic， CD44high FOXP3â CD73high FR4high NRP1+; Teff， CD44high FOXP3â CD73low FR4low; Treg， FOXP3+ CD25+; NaÃ¯ve， CD44low). Chromatin accessibility in sorted CD4+ T cell subpopulations was determined using the ATAC-seq. Briefly， 5 x 10^4 captured cells from each of the indicated groups (n = 2 or 3) were pelleted， washed with PBS， resuspended in cold sterile-filtered lysis buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4， 10mM NaCl， 3mM MgCl2， 0.1% Igepal CA-630)， and immediately centrifuged for 10 minutes (500 x g， 4oC). Pellets were then resuspended in the transposition reaction mix (Nextera TD buffer， Nextera TDE1 transposase， nuclease-free H2O) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37oC. After transposition， DNA was purified with the MinElute PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Library amplification (Nextera dual-indexed)， quality control (Agilent sizing and PicoGreen quantification)， and sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq SP flow cell 2x50-bp paired-end run) were carried out at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. Trimmed ATAC-seq reads (Trimmomatic 0.38.1) were aligned to the mm10 mouse genome assembly using Bowtie2 2.3.3.1 with the â--very-sensitiveâ preset， then sorted and converted in SAMtools 1.13. Peak-calling with integrated PCR duplicate removal and Tn5 transposase cut site interval adjustment was performed on individual samples with Genrich 0.5 (github.com/jsh58/Genrich) in ATAC-seq mode. Reads mapping to mitochondrial DNA and ENCODE blacklist regions were excluded from analysis. From the individual peak-called samples， a total of 38，509 consensus peak sites were determined by DiffBind 2.10.0 (bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DiffBind.html). Peaks were assigned to the gene with the nearest transcription start site using the annotatePeaks program in HOMER v4.11.1  with reference to the mm10 genome assembly and RefSeq annotation coordinates. For the RNA-seq analysis， total RNA was extracted from physically sorted CD4+ T cell populations using a QIAGEN RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Purified RNA quality control (Agilent sizing and RiboGreen quantification)， library creation (Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-seq Kit v2 Pico Input Mammalian)， and sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq SP flow cell 2x50-bp paired-end run) were carried out at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center.

The Epigenetic Regulator Landscape of HOX/MEIS Expression in AML [scRNA-seq],GSE217779,Homo sapiens,Aberrant and constitutive activation of the clustered homeobox (HOX) genes and the three-amino-acid loop extension (TALE) domain-containing HOX co-factor MEIS1 (henceforth termed HOX/MEIS) is a recurrent feature in several types of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. HOX/MEIS misexpression is linked to aberrant self-renewal and therapy resistance in leukemia， but the therapeutic targeting of this important pathway has remained elusive. Using AF10-rearranged leukemia as a prototypical example of HOX/MEIS dysregulation， we sought to comprehensively characterize  chromatin regulators that sustain aberrant expression of these genes. We deployed a GFP-MEIS1 knock-in reporter cell line to conduct small-molecule inhibitor screens and a high-density domain-focused CRISPR-Cas9 screen targeting epigenetic regulators. We identified members of at least six distinct chromatin-modifying complexes as HOX/MEIS regulators， including previously characterized HOX/MEIS regulators such as DOT1L， AF10， ENL， and HBO1 as well as less well-characterized and completely novel HOX/MEIS regulators including AFF2， JADE3， casein kinase 2 and the chromatin reader SGF29. These HOX/MEIS regulators were important for the growth of AML cell lines representing diverse leukemia subtypes characterized by HOX/MEIS dysregulation including leukemias with AF10 rearrangements， MLL rearrangements， and NPM1 mutation. Determination of gene expression changes after perturbing each of these MEIS1 regulators in parallel using CROP-seq demonstrated that the deletion of DOT1L， ENL， AFF2， or SGF29 led to the downregulation of several genes associated with stem cell self-renewal and upregulation of differentiation-associated genes.,We selected sgRNAs targeting MLLT10， MLLT6， MLLT1， SGF29， MLLT3， CSNK2A1， KAT7， BRD4， DOT1L， CSNK2B， AFF4， KMT2A， AFF2 and a non-targeting control and cloned them into the CROPseq-guide-puro vector (Addgene #86708).

Integrative functional genomic analyses identify genetic variants influencing skin pigmentation in Africans,GSE240717,Homo sapiens,Skin color is highly variable in Africans， yet little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. Here we applied massively parallel reporter assays to screen 1，157 candidate variants influencing skin pigmentation in Africans and identified 165 single-nucleotide polymorphisms showing differential regulatory activities between alleles. We combine Hi-C， genome editing and melanin assays to identify regulatory elements for MFSD12， HMG20B， OCA2， MITF， LEF1， TRPS1， BLOC1S6 and CYB561A3 that impact melanin levels in vitro and modulate human skin color. We found that independent mutations in an OCA2 enhancer contribute to the evolution of human skin color diversity and detect signals of local adaptation at enhancers of MITF， LEF1 and TRPS1， which may contribute to the light skin color of Khoesan-speaking populations from Southern Africa. Additionally， we identified CYB561A3 as a novel pigmentation regulator that impacts genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and melanogenesis. These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying human skin color diversity and adaptive evolution.,Refer to individual Series,38200130,Nat Genet
Dissecting long non-coding RNAs derived from microRNA genes in hematopoiesis (scRNA sequencing),GSE181338,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct,"Albeit majority of eukaryotic genome can be pervasively transcribed to a diverse population of lncRNAs and various subtypes of lncRNA have been discovered. However， the genome-wide study of miRNA-derived lncRNAs is still lacking. Here， we report that over 800 miRNA gene-originated lncRNAs (molncRNAs) generated from miRNA loci. One of them， molnc-301b from miR-301b and miR-130b， functions as an ""RNA decoy"" to facilitate dissociation of the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCA5 from chromatin and thereby sequester transcription and mRNA translation. Specifically， molnc-301b attenuates erythropoiesis via mitigating the transcription of erythropoietic and translation-associated genes， such as GATA1 and FOS. In addition， we have established a useful and powerful CRISPR screen platform to characterize the biological functions of molncRNAs at large-scale and single-cell level， and identified 26 functional molncRNAs in hematopoietic cells. Collectively， we focused on miRNA-derived lncRNAs， deciphered their landscape during normal hematopoiesis， and comprehensively evaluated their potential roles.",We designed 3 pooled gRNA libraries: library 1 (molncRNA(-) and internal control) contained more than 2 pairs of gRNAs for each of 12 internal controls (ICs) and the 361 miRNA loci， which were targeted by D1 and D2 gRNAs recognizing the 1-3 kb or 0.5-1 kb downstream region of miRNA precursor to specifically perturb molncRNAs' expression. Library 2 (molncRNA(-/-) and internal control) contained gRNAs for the same target genes as library 1， but recognized the 1-2 kb upstream or 1-3 kb downstream region of the miRNA precursors (U1 and D1 gRNAs) to knock out both molncRNAs and the cognate miRNAs). Library 3 (non-targeting control library) consisted of 2，456 pairs of non-targeting control (NTC) gRNAs. We have applied three replicates for library1 and library2. K562 cells were infected with a mix of lentiviruses expressing Cas9-mCherry at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) ~50 and gRNA-EGFP at a MOI ~4. Infected EGFP+/mCherry+ cells were sorted for 10x Genomics 3' scRNA-seq poly(A)-primed platform， and their corresponding gRNAs were further amplified using a specific amplification protocol(Hill et al.， 2018).,37849233,Adv Sci (Weinh)
BATF represses BIM to sustain tolerant T cells in the periphery (RNA-Seq),GSE244278,Mus musculus,T cells that encounter self-antigens after exiting the thymus avert autoimmunity through peripheral tolerance. Pathways for this include an unresponsive state known as anergy， clonal deletion， and T regulatory (Treg) cell induction. The transcription factor cues and kinetics that guide distinct peripheral tolerance outcomes remain unclear. Here， we found that anergic T cells are epigenetically primed for regulation by the non-classical AP-1 family member BATF. Tolerized BATF-deficient CD4+ T cells were resistant to anergy induction and instead underwent clonal deletion due to pro-apoptotic BIM (Bcl2l11) upregulation. During prolonged antigen exposure， BIM de-repression resulted in fewer PD-1+ conventional T cells as well as loss of peripherally-induced FOXP3+ Treg cells. Simultaneous Batf and Bcl2l11 knockdown meanwhile restored anergic T cell survival and Treg cell maintenance. The data identify the AP-1 nuclear factor BATF as a dominant driver of sustained T cell anergy and illustrate a mechanism for divergent peripheral tolerance fates.,A combination of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq was used to interrogate freshly isolated spleen and lymph node polyclonal CD4 T cell subsets (Anergic， CD44high FOXP3â CD73high FR4high NRP1+; Teff， CD44high FOXP3â CD73low FR4low; Treg， FOXP3+ CD25+; NaÃ¯ve， CD44low). Chromatin accessibility in sorted CD4+ T cell subpopulations was determined using the ATAC-seq. Briefly， 5 x 10^4 captured cells from each of the indicated groups (n = 2 or 3) were pelleted， washed with PBS， resuspended in cold sterile-filtered lysis buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4， 10mM NaCl， 3mM MgCl2， 0.1% Igepal CA-630)， and immediately centrifuged for 10 minutes (500 x g， 4oC). Pellets were then resuspended in the transposition reaction mix (Nextera TD buffer， Nextera TDE1 transposase， nuclease-free H2O) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37oC. After transposition， DNA was purified with the MinElute PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Library amplification (Nextera dual-indexed)， quality control (Agilent sizing and PicoGreen quantification)， and sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq SP flow cell 2x50-bp paired-end run) were carried out at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. Trimmed ATAC-seq reads (Trimmomatic 0.38.1) were aligned to the mm10 mouse genome assembly using Bowtie2 2.3.3.1 with the â--very-sensitiveâ preset， then sorted and converted in SAMtools 1.13. Peak-calling with integrated PCR duplicate removal and Tn5 transposase cut site interval adjustment was performed on individual samples with Genrich 0.5 (github.com/jsh58/Genrich) in ATAC-seq mode. Reads mapping to mitochondrial DNA and ENCODE blacklist regions were excluded from analysis. From the individual peak-called samples， a total of 38，509 consensus peak sites were determined by DiffBind 2.10.0 (bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DiffBind.html). Peaks were assigned to the gene with the nearest transcription start site using the annotatePeaks program in HOMER v4.11.1  with reference to the mm10 genome assembly and RefSeq annotation coordinates. For the RNA-seq analysis， total RNA was extracted from physically sorted CD4+ T cell populations using a QIAGEN RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Purified RNA quality control (Agilent sizing and RiboGreen quantification)， library creation (Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-seq Kit v2 Pico Input Mammalian)， and sequencing (Illumina NovaSeq SP flow cell 2x50-bp paired-end run) were carried out at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. RNA-seq reads were processed using an established pipeline (https://github.com/msi-ris/CHURP/wiki/PURR-Manual-Page). This pipeline incorporates the following software components: Trimmomatic， HISAT2， SAMtools， featureCounts， and edgeR. For visualization at select gene loci， ATAC-seq and RNA-seq mapped reads were summed from sample replicates using the bigwigCompare tool for display using Integrated Genomics Viewer.,37862030,J Exp Med
Tumoral and stromal hMENA isoforms influence tertiary lymphoid structure localization and predict response to immunocheckpoint blockade in lung cancer patients,GSE217451,Homo sapiens,The advent of immunotherapy in the clinical practice of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have highlighted the impact of the tumor immune microenvironment in the control of the tumor progression， as well as in the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS)， determinants of antitumor immunity， are associated with a favorable clinical outcome in NSCLC patients and with the effectiveness of ICB in several tumors. The actin regulatory protein hMENA undergoes tissue-specific splicing， with tumors expressing hMENA11ahigh/ stromal fibronectin (FN1)low related to early N0 NSCLC patients with a favorable prognosis. hMENA/hMENAâv6 is overexpressed in pro-tumoral CAFs related to the subtype of immunosuppressive ECM-my-CAFHerein， by analyzing the pattern of hMENA isoform expression in tumor cells and CAFs， we highlighted the role of hMENA as a crucial factor in the communication among tumor cells CAFs， T and B cells. Mechanistically， we demonstrated that in NSCLC cell lines hMENA11a increases the expression of the TLS regulator LTÎ²R， reduces the FN1 expression and favors CXCL13 production by tissue resident T cells. Conversely in CAFs， hMENA/hMENAÎv6 inhibits the NF-kB pathway downstream to LTÎ²R and the secretion of CXCL13， crucial in TLS formation. Of clinical relevance， our experimental data support our finding in primary tumors that TLS localized within the tumor area (TLS-IT) are predictive of a longer disease-free survival in N0 NSCLC patients and are accompanied by the maturation of B cells in the tumor tissue. TLS-IT associate with paucity of hMENA positive CAFs， low stromal FN1 and high hMENA11a tumor cell expression. To translate these results in a clinical setting of ICB treated patients， we identified a signature based on the pattern of hMENA isoforms， FN1 and LTÎ²R expression that may discriminate NSCLC patients responding or not-responding to ICB.,Gene expression profiling through RNA-seq for each biological replicate of H1650 cell line transfected with siControl， sihMENA(t)， siMENA11a.,38340557,EBioMedicine
LAST-seq:single-cell RNA sequencing by direct amplification of single-stranded RNA without prior reverse transcription and second-strand synthesis,GSE211836,Homo sapiens,Existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods rely on reverse transcription (RT) and second-strand synthesis (SSS) to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA prior to amplification， with the limited RT/SSS efficiency compromising RNA detectability. Here， we develop a new scRNA-seq method， Linearly Amplified Single-stranded-RNA-derived Transcriptome sequencing (LAST-seq)， which directly amplifies the original single-stranded RNA molecules without prior RT/SSS. LAST-seq offers a high single-molecule capture efficiency and a low level of technical noise for single-cell transcriptome analyses. Using LAST-seq， we characterize transcriptional bursting kinetics in human cells， revealing a role of topologically associating domains in transcription regulation.,HEK293T  and eHAP1 cells were sorted by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed using scRNAseq.,37559123,Genome Biol
Removal of oxaliplatin- and cisplatin-DNA lesions requires different global genome repair mechanisms that affect their clinical efficacy.,GSE227871,Homo sapiens,The therapeutical efficacy of cisplatin and oxaliplatin depends on the balance between the DNA damage induction and the DNA damage response of tumor cells. Based on clinical evidence， oxaliplatin is administered to cisplatin-unresponsive cancers， but the underlying molecular causes for this tumor specificity are not clear. Hence， stratification of patients based on DNA repair profiling is not sufficiently utilized for treatment selection.Using a combination of genetic， transcriptomic and imaging approaches， we identified factors that promote global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) of DNA-platinum adducts induced by oxaliplatin， but not by cisplatin. We show that oxaliplatin-DNA lesions are a poor substrate for GG-NER initiating factor XPC and that DDB2 and HMGA2 are required for efficient binding of XPC to oxaliplatin lesions and subsequent GG-NER initiation. Loss of DDB2 and HMGA2 therefore leads to hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin but not to cisplatin. As a result， low DDB2 levels in different colon cancer cells are associated with GG-NER deficiency and oxaliplatin hypersensitivity. Finally， we show that colon cancer patients with low DDB2 levels have a better prognosis after oxaliplatin treatment than patients with high DDB2 expression. We therefore propose that DDB2 is a promising predictive marker of oxaliplatin treatment efficiency in colon cancer.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for XPCoxa-inactive cells (DLD-1 and Lovo) versus XPCoxa-active (HCT116 and SW480).

Environmental regulation of male fertility is mediated through Arabidopsis bHLH89， 91 and 10,GSE248735,Arabidopsis thaliana,Formation of functional pollen and successful fertilisation relies upon the spatial and temporal regulation of anther and pollen development. This process responds to environmental cues to maintain optimal fertility despite climatic changes. Arabidopsis transcription factors bHLH10，-89，-91 were previously thought to be functionally redundant in their control of male reproductive development， however here we show that they play distinct roles in the integration of light signals to maintain pollen development under different environmental conditions. Combinations of the double and triple bHLH10，-89，-91 mutants were analysed under normal (200Î¼mol/m2/s) and low (50Î¼mol/m2/s) light conditions to determine the impact on fertility. Transcriptomic analysis of a new conditionally sterile bhlh89，91 double mutant shows differential regulation of genes related to sexual reproduction， hormone signal transduction and lipid storage and metabolism under low-light. Here we have shown that bHLH89 and bHLH91 play a role in regulating fertility in response to light， suggesting they function in mitigating environmental variation to ensure fertility is maintained under environmental stress.,To elucidate the genetic basis of conditional sterility in the Arabidopsis thaliana bhlh89，91 double mutant here we present an RNA-Seq， comparing floral transcriptomic changes under normal (200Î¼mol/m2/s) and low (50Î¼mol/m2/s) intensity light conditions to wild-type Col-0.,38066689,J Exp Bot
Hypoxic regulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha via antisense transcription,GSE221387,Homo sapiens,Impaired oxygen homeostasis is a frequently encountered pathophysiological factor in multiple complex diseases， including cardiovascular disease and cancer. While the canonical hypoxia response pathway is well characterised， less is known about the role of non-coding RNAs in this process. Here， we investigated the nascent and steady-state non-coding transcriptional responses in endothelial cells and their potential roles in regulating the hypoxic response. Notably， we identify a novel antisense long non-coding RNA that convergently overlaps the majority of the HIF1A locus， which is expressed across several cell types and elevated in atherosclerotic lesions. The antisense (HIF1A-AS) is produced as a stable， unspliced and polyadenylated nuclear retained transcript. HIF1A-AS is highly induced in hypoxia by both HIF1A and HIF2A and exhibits anticorrelation with the coding HIF1a transcript. We further characterized this functional relationship by CRISPR-mediated bimodal perturbation of the HIF1A-AS promoter. We provide evidence that HIF1A-AS represses the expression of HIF1a in cis by repressing transcriptional elongation and deposition of H3K4me3， and that this mechanism is dependent on the act of antisense transcription.,ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis of Eahy cells deleted for the HIF1a-AS promoter/TSS.,37748649,J Biol Chem
CTCF Loss Potentiates P53 Mediated Gene Transcription in Breast Tissue,GSE217698,Homo sapiens,A single copy loss of CTCF is found in about 50% of breast cancer patients. Based on clinical TCGA data we hypothesized that the loss of CTCF may potentiate TP53 target gene expression in patients. Using MCF10A cells as a model， we deleted a single copy of CTCF using CRISPR/Cas9. We found， using qPCR and RNA-seq， that cells carrying low CTCF displayed an enhanced TP53 response after exposure to chemotherapeutics. Using ATAC-seq， we aimed to explore whether the elevated induction of TP53 target gene transcription was associated with changes in open or closed chromatin structure. Specifically， we were interested in comparing chromatin accessibility at TP53 target genes within MCF10A CTCF +/- cells compared to control cells following the induction of DNA damage (6uM cisplatin for 8h). We discovered that accessibility of the transcription start site is associated with heightened gene expression in CTCF+/- compared to the control. Interestingly， for a subset of TP53 response genes， there is increased accessibility on both transcriptional start sites and termination sites following the induction of DNA damage. The importance of chromatin accessibility at these two regions is still under investigation. Additionally， accessible gene regions at both sites also appear to have greater enrichment within TADS in the CTCF+/- cell compared to the control. We propose that the increased accessibility of TP53 target genes following damage represents a mechanism enhancing the efficacy of the TP53-regulated DNA damage response.,Using MCF10A cells as a model， we deleted a single copy of CTCF using CRISPR/Cas9， creating two knockdowns: #17 and # 22. Triplicates were utilized for treatments of the control， #17， and #22 where we utilized 6uM Cisplatin to investigate DNA damage at 0h and 8h after treatment.,nan,

High-throughput Single-cell Profiling of B cell Responses Following Inactivated Influenza Vaccination in Young and Older Adults (single-cell Gene Expression),GSE175522,Homo sapiens,Seasonal influenza contributes to a substantial disease burden annually， resulting in approximately 10 million hospital visits and 50 thousand deaths in a typical year in the US. 90% of the annual mortality from influenza occurs in people over the age of 65. While influenza vaccination is the best protection against the virus， it is less effective for the elderly. This may be due to differences in the quantity or type of B cells induced by vaccination in older individuals. To investigate this possibility， we leveraged recent development in single-cell technology that allows for simultaneous measurement of both gene expression profile and the B cell receptor (BCR) at single-cell resolution. Pre- and post-vaccination peripheral blood B cells were sorted from three young and three older adults who responded to the inactivated influenza vaccine and were profiled using single-cell RNAseq with paired BCR sequencing. At pre-vaccination， we observed a higher somatic hypermutation frequency and a higher abundance of activated B cells in older adults than in young adults. Following vaccination， young adults mounted a more clonal response than older adults. The response involved a mix of plasmablasts， activated B cells， and resting memory B cells in both age groups. The response in young adults was dominated by expansion in plasmablasts， while the response in older adults also involved activated B cells. We observed a consistent change in gene expression in plasmablasts after vaccination between age groups but not in the activated B cells. These quantitative and qualitative differences in the B cell response may provide insights into the age-related change of influenza vaccination response.,To understand the age-group difference in B cells underlying a successful vaccination response， we selected three young (20- to 30-years-old) and three older (60- to 100-years-old) subjects who responded to seasonal influenza vaccine with at least 4 fold increase of HAI titer for at least one vaccine strain from a cohort recruited at Yale University over the five vaccination seasons between 2010 and 2014.,37367734,Aging (Albany NY)

Susceptible Gossypium barbadense inbred lines Pima S-7 (PI 560140) and Pima 3-79 susceptible to Fusarium wilt [Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum (FOV)] race 4 (FOV4)， and Pima S-6 (PI 608346) which is resistant to FOV4 infection， were used for the preparation of cDNA libraries and further RNA-seq analyses. An isolate of FOV4 (FOV CA-14) from a naturally infested field in Fresno County in the San Joaquin Valley， California was used in this study.,Susceptible Gossypium barbadense inbred lines Pima S-7 (PS7) and Pima 3-79 (P379) susceptible to FOV4 and Pima-S6 (PS6)， resistant to FOV4， were used for the preparation of cDNA libraries/RNAseq analyses. An isolate of FOV4 (FOV CA-14) from a naturally infested field in Fresno County in the San Joaquin Valley， California was used in this study. We used no inoculation for control plants， three replicates for FOV4-inoculated and non-inoculated control， respectively. Cultures from single spores were stored on filter paper at -20oC. To produce inoculum， the isolate was grown in 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes containing 20 ml potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 3 mM streptomycin per liter at room temperature for 1 week. Then a few patches of 2-3-mm-squre of fresh grown culture were cut and put into 500 ml flasks containing potato dextrose liquid medium with 3 mM streptomycin at 28 C with rotation for 3-4 days.  The conidial suspension was then filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth to remove hyphae， quantified with the aid of a hemacytometer， and diluted with water to obtain 1 x 10^6 conidia per ml. Cultivars or genotypes were germinated in seedling trays for one week and then seedlings were uprooted. Roots were rinsed with tap water and immediately dipped for 3 min into an aqueous suspension of FOV4 inoculum containing 1 x 10^6 conidia per ml. The non-inoculated control plants were processed the same way except they were dipped into water without FOV4. Seedlings were then transplanted into steam-sterilized U.C. Mix #2 (Baker， 1957) soil in new pots with five plants in each pot and placed in a warm greenhouse maintained between 24-28 degrees Celcius. At 11 days after inoculation (dai)， the plant and soil ball were removed from the pots， and the soil removed gently from roots by washing under continuous water flow. The washed roots were placed immediately in 50ml screw-top plastic vials， liquid nitrogen was added， and the vials placed in a -80o C freezer with the tops off to allow vaporization of the liquid N.,38259617,Front Genet
txci-ATAC-seq: a massive-scale single-cell technique to profile chromatin accessibility,GSE231708,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,"We develop a large-scale single-cell ATAC-seq method (txci-ATAC-seq) by combining Tn5-based pre-indexing with 10X Genomics barcoding. Leveraging this molecular hashing strategy， we demonstrate that txci-ATAC-seq enables the indexing of up to 200，000 nuclei across multiple samples in a single emulsion reaction， representing a ~22-fold increase in throughput compared to the standard workflow at the same collision rate. To improve the multiplexing capability of this new technique， we further develop a ""phased"" protocol variant (Phased-txci-ATAC-seq) that effectively decouples sample processing from library preparation and has the potential to profile up to 96 samples simultaneously. In this study， we profile 449，953 nuclei across diverse tissues， including the human cortex， mouse brain， human lung， mouse lung， mouse liver， and lung tissue from a club cell secretory protein knockout (CC16-/-) model. Our study of CC16-/- nuclei uncovers previously underappreciated technical artifacts derived from remnant 129 mouse strain genetic material， which cause profound cell-type-specific changes in regulatory elements near many genes， thereby confounding the interpretation of this commonly referenced mouse model.",We extracted nuclei from multiple sources， including GM12878 and CH12.LX cell lines， human lung tissue， native lung and liver samples from two 24-week-old male C57BL/6J mice， and lung tissue from age-matched (~8 weeks) wild-type (n=3) and CC16 deficient (n=3) mice on a C57BL/6J background. Two different barnyard settings were designed to estimate the total collisions arising from pre- and/or post-pooling events. To test the total collision rate， the human and mouse cells were mixed in the same well at a 1:1 ratio to perform barcoded transposition (âtrue barnyardâ). The collision rate driven by events downstream of pooling was tested by performing barcoded transposition on wells containing pure species (âpseudo-barnyardâ) and pooling the human and mouse nuclei afterward.,38519979,Genome Biol
Cell-matrix interactions control biliary organoids polarity，architecture  and differentiation and can be exploited to improve modelling of biliary diseases [bulk RNA-seq],GSE204958,Homo sapiens,Diseases of the biliary epithelium (cholangiopathies) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Their pathogenesis and treatment remain unclear， in part because of the lack of disease models relevant to humans. 3D biliary organoids hold great promise， however the inaccessibility of their apical pole， and the presence of extracellular matrix (EBM) limit their experimental application. Here we show that when b integrin signaling is inhibited， either by removing the EMC or using blocking antibodies， biliary organoids revert their polarity and expose the apical membrane. Functional， immunohistochemical and TEM studies， along with bulk and single cell transcriptomic demonstrate that organoids in this novel 3D configuration， are less heterogeneous， show increased biliary differentiation， and decreased expression of stem cell markers. This model can be used to study bile transport， interactions with microbial agents， epithelial permeability， cross-talk with other liver and immune cell types and the effect of matrix changes on the biliary epithelium.,Liver organoids were generated from liver explants (n=4) and were cultured embedded in the ECM (EMB) or suspended in ECM/media mix (10% BME) or without ECM.,36972396,Hepatol Commun
RNA-seq analysis reveals modulation of inflammatory pathways by an enriched-triterpene natural extract in mouse and human macrophage cell lines,GSE250471,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Chronic Inflammation has a key role in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Previously， we demonstrated that OBE100， a natural extract from the leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis， has anti-inflammatory properties. Three pentacyclic triterpenoids， ursolic acid， oleanolic acid， and ursolic acid lactone are the major compounds present in OBE100. These molecules have shown multiple biological activities. In this study we analyzed how the compounds of OBE100 modify macrophage gene expression using RNA sequencing. Triterpenoids regulate the inflammatory program in activated macrophages inhibiting the expression of many cytokines， chemokines， and inflammatory mediators. However， the OBE100 extract has a more powerful immunomodulatory effect than the triterpene mixture increasing the number of genes regulated， both in mouse and human models. Our study shows that OBE100 is a promising extract for the treatment of diabetes that can break the link between inflammation and insulin resistance.,To establish the effect and molecular mechanisms of the OBE100 extract， we bought J774A.1 (TIB-67â¢) mouse monocyte; macrophage cells and U-937 (CRL-1593.2) human monocytic (pre-macrophage line)， we differentiated them to macrophages using 100 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)， and  we treated the samples with Crude extract OBE100， M1 (mixture of UA， OA and UAL)， UA， OA， and UALWe then performed RNA seq profiling using data obtained from RNA-seq.

Teosinte Pollen Drive guides maize domestication and evolution by RNA interference [RNA-seq]],GSE234923,Zea mays subsp. mays x Zea mays subsp. mexicana,Meiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis， while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males.  Cryptic drive is thought to be pervasive and can be unleashed following hybridization with a naÃ¯ve genome， resulting in sterility and hybrid incompatibility. Using single molecule and single pollen genome sequencing， we describe an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana)， that depends on RNA interference (RNAi) in the male germline. Multiple hairpin-derived small RNA from mexicana target a novel domestication gene，  Teosinte Drive Responder，  that is required for pollen fertility and has undergone selection for immunity to RNAi.  Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas.  A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals allelic bias at genes required for RNAi on at least 4 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids.  Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication， and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of hairpin-encoded and other endogenous small RNA  in the germlines of plants and animals.,Total RNA sequencing (rRNA depleted) of tpd1;tpd2， Tpd1+/-;Tpd2+/-， and Tpd1+/-;tpd2 bulk pollen,39112710,Nature

Pan-cancer single-nucleus total RNA sequencing using HH-seq,GSE237166,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Tumor heterogeneity and its drivers impair tumor progression and cancer therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing has been used to investigate the heterogeneity of tumor ecosystems.Â However， most methods of scRNA-seq amplify the termini of polyadenylated transcripts， making it challenging to perform total RNA analysis and somatic mutation analysis during tumor processing. Additionally， frozen tumor samples constitute a vast and valuable material bank for cancer research. Therefore， we developed a high-throughput and high-sensitivity method called HH-seq， which combines random primers and a pre-index strategy in the droplet microfluidic platform. This innovative method allows for the detection of total RNA in single nuclei from clinically frozen samples. We also established a robust pipeline to facilitate the analysis of full-length RNA-seq data. We applied HH-seq to more than 730，000 single nuclei from 32 patients with various tumor types. The pan-cancer study enables us to comprehensively profile data on the tumor transcriptome， including expression levels， mutations， splicing patterns and clone dynamic， etc. We identified new malignant cell subclusters and explored their specific function across cancers. Furthermore， we investigated the malignant status of epithelial cells among different cancer types with respect to mutation and splicing patterns. The ability to detect full-length RNA at the single-nucleus level provides a powerful tool for studying complex biological systems and has broad implications for understanding tumor pathology.,Single nuclei RNA-sequencing of cell lines and mouse tissues using HH-seq， benchmark analysis was performed.7 mouse brain samples were analyzed in four conditions of snHH-seq: different reverse transcription primer (No_index， RT primer without cell barcode 2; Index， RT primer with cell barcode 2)， different sample storage (frozen， nuclei isolated from frozen sample; fresh， nuclei isolated from fresh sample).The MIX samples (human-mouse mix experiment) show the effect of cell concentration on contamination rate.,38010945,Adv Sci (Weinh)
PAX5 promotes heterocharomatin formation,GSE165035,Homo sapiens,Heterochromatin has a high density of DNA and low rates of gene transcription.H3k9me3 is a conserved histone modification， and is best known for its role in constitutive heterochromatin formation.H1155， which is a neuroendocrine large cell lung cancer cell line， has a dense nucleus and a high level of occupancy of H3K9me3. PAX5 is a neurogenesis and B lymphocyte development transcription factor， and endogenous expressed in neuroendocrine carcinoma， including H1155 cell line. To assess whether PAX5 promotes heterochromatin formation in H1155， we knock out PAX5 in H1155 cell (KO-PAX5) by CRISPR/Cas9 and use H3K9me3 to performed ChIP-seq.,ChIP-seq analysis of H1155-WT (control) and KO-PAX5 (experimental group) with H3K9me3 antibody， two replicates. In order to calibrate the data， we mix 1% of Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells with the tested cells and perform sonication， sipike in antibosy were added at the same time with H3K9me3.,nan,
Active regulatory elements recruit cohesin to establish cell-specific chromatin domains [ChIP-seq],GSE244925,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,The genome adopts varied and specific 3D conformations in different cell types.  The loop extruding factor， cohesin， is thought to play a key role in the formation of this 3D structure， however it is unknown how cell-type specificity is achieved. One proposed mechanism is that cis-regulatory elements， which are active in unique combinations in different cell types， recruit cohesin and therefore direct the formation of specific 3D conformation.  We have identified genome-wide natural variation in enhancer sites in healthy human donors， by performing cohesin ChIP-seq in these cells we show that cohesin occupancy is directly correlated with enhancer activity.  Identification of the genetic variants associated with the gain or loss of enhancer-like elements and associating this with the recruitment of cohesin provides evidence of a direct link between widespread genetic variation in the non-coding genome and cell-specific changes in 3D genome organization. Therefore， enhancer elements have evolved not only the ability to upregulate transcription at promoters， but also the ability to stimulate the mechanisms that insure robust interactions between them.   Next， using enhancer KO models in the well characterised alpha globin locus， we show how cohesin recruitment and 3D genome organization correlates with changes in the local regulatory landscape. We then selected the strongest of the alpha globin enhancers and inserted it into a neutral region of the genome， to test if a single active enhancer was capable of recruiting cohesin and initiating the formation of a 3D chromatin domain when isolated from its native context.  Our results show that an enhancer is able to direct the recruitment of cohesin when in an active state and that this is correlated with changes in the local chromatin environment， giving rise to open chromatin sites and de novo chromatin interactions in an otherwise âneutralâ region of the genome.  These results support the hypothesis that tissue-specific recruitment of cohesin is facilitated by enhancers and that this plays a role in establishing cell-specific changes in 3D genome conformation.,ChIP-seq was performed on aliquots of 3-10x10^6CD71+ cells. For calibrated ChIP-seq， a 1% or 4% spike-in of WT HEK293 cells were added prior to sonication. Cells were double cross-linked using disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG， Sigma) and 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) for a total fixation time of 1 hour. Fixed chromatin samples were fragmented using the Covaris sonicator (ME220) for 10 minutes (75 power， 1000 cycles per burst， 25% duty factor) at 4Â°C. 50Î¼L per sample was removed as an input control. Sonicated samples were pre-cleared to remove background signal through incubation with a 1:1 mix of Protein A/G Dynabeads (InVitrogen). Antibody was added at a concentration of 1 Î¼g/Î¼L per sample and immunoprecipitated at 4Â°C overnight.  Immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with a 1:1 mix of Protein A/G Dynabeads for 5 hours at 4Â°C. Beads were then washed 4x in RIPA buffer on a magnetic stand， followed by 1x wash with TE (Sigma Aldridge) + 50mM NaCl (ThermoFisher). Chromatin was eluted from the beads using elution buffer and incubated for 30 minutes at 65Â°C with shaking. Input samples were diluted 1:1 with elution buffer. Samples and input controls were incubated at 65Â°C overnight for de-crosslinking， before RNase (Roche) and proteinase K (BioLabs) treatment. DNA fragments were purified using the Zymo ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research) and eluted in water. DNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) as per manufacturers protocol. To assess sonication efficiency the D1000 Tapestation (Agilent) assay was performed on input sample.  An approximately equal mass of input and IP DNA was used for indexing (0.5 ng â 1 Î¼g). NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) was used to prepare indexed sequencing libraries following the manufacturer supplied protocol.  PCR amplification was performed for 7-11 cycles (depending on input DNA concentration) using NEBNext Mulitplex Oligos (New England Biolabs). Indexed sample concentration was quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Complete Kit (Universal)(Roche).  Samples were pooled as a 4 nM library and sequenced with a high-Output v2 75 cycle kits on the Illumina NextSeq platform.,nan,
Inhibition of topoisomerase 1 and BRD4-mediated pause release selectively kills tumours by inducing readthrough transcription [Repli-seq],GSE211470,Homo sapiens,Transcription inhibition has become an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy because many cancers arise from dysregulated transcription programs. Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) coordinate each other to regulate transcriptional elongation. Using a collection of patient-derived xenograft mouse models of pancreatic cancer we show that the combined inhibition of TOP1 and BRD4 is synergistic in arresting tumor growth. We link this effect to the ability of TOP1 and BRD4 to control pause-release， a rate-limiting step in early elongation. By comparing nascent transcripts with the recruitment of elongation and termination factors along genes， we found that combined inhibition of TOP1 and BRD4， while globally impairing RNA production， also disturbs the recruitment of proteins involved in termination. Thus， RNA polymerases stay engaged with the DNA downstream of polyadenylation sites for hundreds of kilobases leading to readthrough-transcription. Because this pervasive transcription occurs also during replication， it perturbs replisome progression leading to increased DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. The synergistic effect of TOP1 and BRD4 inhibition is specific for the tumor cells as negligible transcriptional defects are observed in non-tumor cells. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the benefit of combining TOP1 and BRD4 inhibitors in the treatment of highly transcription- and replication-driven tumors.,Repli-seq in bo103 cells.,37831776,Sci Adv
Impact of CD4+ T cell help on CD8+ CAR T cell gene expression during ex-vivo manufacturing,GSE245427,Homo sapiens,Cell culture conditions impact the clinical efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell products， but the optimal approach remains unknown. Separate CD4+ and CD8+ cultures offer a potential advantage but complicate manufacturing and may affect cell expansion and function. We evaluated the co-culture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells at a defined ratio at culture initiation. We observed that the presence of CD4+ cells markedly improves expansion of CD8+ CAR T cells， and CD8+ cells cultured in isolation exhibit a hypofunctional phenotype and transcriptional signature compared with those co-cultured with CD4+ cells. Mixed-culture CAR T cells also confer superior anti-tumor activity in vivo compared with separately expanded， co-infused cells. CD4+ cell effects on CD8+ cells are mediated through both cytokines and direct cell contact， including CD40L-CD40 and CD70-CD27 interactions.,We analyzed transcriptional profiles of CD8+ CAR T cells from 6 subjects (a mix of healthy donors and patients with B-cell lymphoma) expanded in mixed cultures with CD4+ cells compared with those in separate CD8-only cell cultures. Total RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted CD8+ T cells expressing a 3rd generation CD20-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) containing CD28 and 41BB costimulatory domains， at either day 8 (without restimulation) or day 14 (after restimulation with CD20+ lymphoblastoid cells at day 7).,nan,

ZNF714 â a novel oncogene in lung cancer cells,GSE238088,Homo sapiens,The emerging data indicate that many KRAB-ZNF factors belonging to a large gene family may be involved in carcinogenesis. Our previous study identified ZNF714， a KRAB-ZNF gene of unknown function， as commonly overexpressed in many tumors， pointing to its hypothetical oncogenic role. We knocked down ZNF714 gene expression in two lung cancer cell lines: H2073 (lung adenocarcinoma) and SKMES (squamous cell carcinoma)， and subjected them to methylation microarray analysis. We identified 45k DMRs in H2073 and 75k DMRs in SKMES. In both cell lines， the majority of changes (both hypo- and hypermethylation) occurred within gene bodies and promoter regions (TSS1500 and TSS200). The only visible altered methylation pattern indicated more frequent hypomethylation within the promoter region in both shZNF714 cell lines. We correlated those results with our RNA-seq analysis and identified target genes simultaneously overexpressed and unmethylated in cells with knocked-down ZNF714 expression. We identified 54 genes in H2073 and 36 genes in SKMES that met our criteria. Interestingly， several of those genes have documented tumor-suppressive functions， further supporting our in vitro results demonstrating an oncogenic role of ZNF714.,We analyzed 6 samples from two different lung cancer cell lines in biological triplicates (total 18 samples). For each cell line (H2073 and SKMES) we analyzed unmodified cells (WT)， cells with knocked-down expression of ZNF714 (shZNF714) and cells carrying control shRNA sequence (shLUC).,37958512,Int J Mol Sci
Retinoic  acid modulation guides human-induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation towards left or right ventricle-like cardiomyocytes,GSE245954,Homo sapiens,Background: Cardiomyocytes (CMs) induced from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by traditional methods are a mix of atrial and ventricular CMs and many other non-cardiomyocytes. Retinoic acid (RA) plays an important role in regulation of the spatiotemporal development of the embryonic heart and high concentrations of RA have been shown to steer differentiation towards atrial CMs， whereas lower concentrations of RA promote a more ventricular-like CM profile. Aim: Create engineered heart tissue (EHT) with left and right ventricular phenotype from hiPSCs by intervening with specific concentrations of retinoic acid (RA) during hiPSC differentiation towards CM. Methods: hiPSC were derived by reprogramming skin fibroblasts. Different concentrations of RA (Control group without RA， LRA group with 0.05 ÂµM and HRA group with 0.1 ÂµM) were administered during third to sixth days of the differentiation process. Engineered heart tissues (EHTs) were generated by assembling CMs derived from hiPSC (hiPSC-CM) at high cell density in a low collagen hydrogel. The maturation and growth of EHTs were induced in a customized biomimetic tissue culture system， that provides continuous electrical stimulation， medium agitation and stretch. The function of CMs and EHTs was analyzed under different conditions. Finally， RNA extraction and tissue fixation were performed on CMs and EHTs for RT-qPRC and immunofluorescence staining analysis. RNA sequencing was conducted on EHTs to examine how RA affects both the function and structure of EHT. Results: In the HRA group， hiPSC-CMs exhibited the first onset of beating and showed the highest expression of maturity genes MYH7 and cTnT. The expression of TBX5， NKX2.5 and CORIN， which are the marker genes for left ventricular CMs， was also the highest in the HRA group. The transcription factor MEF2C associated with RA and ventricular development genes， NPPA and MYH7， were highly expressed in the HRA group， while GATA4 was less expressed in the HRA group. In terms of EHT， the HRA group displayed the highest contraction force， the lowest beating frequency， and the highest sensitivity to hypoxia and isoprenaline， which means it was more functionally similar to the left ventricle. The expression of TBX5 and NKX2.5 was found to be the highest expression in the HRA group of EHT， while expression of TBX20 and ISL1 was found to be the highest expression in control group. When the electrical stimulation frequency of EHT in the HRA group was raised， it correspondingly increased its contractile force. The heightened contractility of EHT within the HRA group can be attributed to the promotion of augmented extracellular matrix strength by RA. Conclusion: By interfering with the differentiation process of hiPSC with a specific concentration of RA at a specific time， we were able to successfully induce CMs and EHT with a phenotype similar to that of the left ventricle or right ventricle. Our research paved the way for future studies on in vitro left ventricular or right ventricular function， personalized drug screening， and precision medicine.,To investigate molecular changes underlying the improved organisation of the EHTs derived from hiPSC-CMs previously exposed to RA. Different concentrations of RA (Control group without RA， LRA group with 0.05 ÂµM and HRA group with 0.1 ÂµM) were administered during third to sixth days of the hiPSCs differentiation process.

Disrupting cellular memory to overcome drug resistance,GSE237228,Homo sapiens,"Plasticity enables cells to change their gene expression state in the absence of a genetic change. At the single-cell level， these gene expression states can persist for different lengths of time which is a quantitative measurement referred to as gene expression memory. Because plasticity is not encoded by genetic changes， these cell states can be reversible， and therefore， are amenable to modulation by disrupting gene expression memory. However， we currently do not have robust methods to find the regulators of memory or to track state switching in plastic cell populations. Here， we developed a lineage tracing-based technique to quantify gene expression memory and to identify single cells as they undergo cell state transitions. Applied to human melanoma cells， we quantified long-lived fluctuations in gene expression that underlie resistance to targeted therapy. Further， we identified the PI3K and TGF-Î² pathways as modulators of these state dynamics. Applying the gene expression signatures derived from this technique， we find that these expression states are generalizable to in vivo models and present in scRNA-seq from patient tumors. Leveraging the PI3K and TGF-Î² pathways as dials on memory between plastic states， we propose a ""pretreatment"" model in which we first use a PI3K inhibitor to modulate the expression states of the cell population and then apply targeted therapy. This plasticity informed dosing scheme ultimately yields fewer resistant colonies than targeted therapy alone. Taken together， we describe a technique to find modulators of gene expression memory and then apply this knowledge to alter plastic cell states and their connected cell fates.",Melanoma cells were growth in tissue culture and some were barcoded， sorted using FACS， and/or have undergone different treatments depending on the experiment (more details below and in the manuscript).

Single-nucleus multiomic mapping of m6A methylome and transcriptome in native populations of cells with sn-m6A-CT [scRNA-seq， scCUT&Tag],GSE217255,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification plays important roles in the governance of gene expression and is temporally regulated in different cell states. In contrast to global m6A profiling in bulk sequencing， technologies for analyzing m6A heterogeneity across single-cells are not extensively established. Here， we report single-nucleus m6A CUT-Tag (sn-m6A-CT) for simultaneous profiling of m6A methylome and transcriptome within a single nucleus. m6A-CT is capable of enriching m6A-marked RNA molecules in situ， without isolating RNAs from cells， in a highly efficient manner. We adapted m6A-CT to the droplet-based single-cell omics platform and demonstrated high throughput performance in analyzing nuclei isolated from thousands of cells from various cell types. We show that sn-m6A-CT profiling is sufficient to determine cell identity and allows the generation of cell-type-specific m6A methylome landscapes from heterogeneous populations. Further， we exemplified the robust deconvolution capabilities in m6A heterogeneities with stem cells in multiple distinct pluripotency states. These indicate that sn-m6A-CT provides additional dimensions to multimodal datasets and new insights into epitranscriptomic landscape in defining cell fate identity and states.,Bulk CUT&Tag or single-nucleus CUT&Tag followed by Illumina sequencing,37657444,Mol Cell
Interactions of erythromycin and an antibiotic-mixture to the gut microbiome of juvenile rainbow trout,GSE253746,Oncorhynchus mykiss,Erythromycin (ERY) is a commonly used antibiotic that can be found in wastewater effluents globally. Due to the mechanisms by which they kill and prevent bacterial growth， antibiotics can have significant unwanted impacts on the fish gut microbiome. The overall objective of this project was to assess the effects of erythromycin and an antibiotic mixture on fish gut microbiomes. The project was split into two experiments to assess gut microbiome in response to exposure with ERY alone or in mixture with other common antibiotics. The objectives of experiment 1 were to understand uptake and depuration of ERY in juvenile rainbow trout (RBT) over a 7 d uptake followed by a 7 d depuration period using three concentrations of ERY. Furthermore， throughout the study changes in gut microbiome response were assessed. In experiment 2， a follow-up study was conducted using an identical experimental design to assess the impacts of an antibiotic-mixture (ERY， ampicillin， metronidazole， and ciprofloxacin at 100 Âµg/g each). Here， three matrices were analyzed， with gut collected for 16s metabarcoding， plasma for untargeted metabolomics， and brain for mRNA-seq analysis. ERY was depurated from the fish relatively quickly and gut microbiome dysbiosis was observed at 7 d after exposure， with a slight recovery after the 7 d depuration period. A greater number of plasma metabolites was dysregulated at 14 d compared to 7 d revealing temporality compared to gut microbiome dysbiosis. Furthermore， several transformation products of antibiotics and biomarker metabolites were observed in plasma due to antibiotic exposure. Brain transcriptome revealed only slight alterations due to antibiotic exposure. The results of these studies will help inform aquaculture practitioners and risk assessors when assessing the potential impacts of antibiotics in fish feed and the environment， with implications for host health.,Five RBT were exposed in each of six replicate 20-L tanks for each treatment in a dilutor system to regulate temperature (12Â°C) and light (14 h: 10 h light: dark). To maintain optimal water quality and consistency of the water microbiome， fish were housed under flow-through conditions with three complete renewals of cold， filtered facility water every 24 h. During experiments， water quality was assessed every 3 days. RBT were exposed via diet to two treatments of antibiotics， including 1，000 Âµg ERY/g and a mixture of antibiotics (ant-mix) containing nominal concentrations of 100 Âµg/g each of ampicillin， metronidazole， ciprofloxacin， and ERY， and one solvent control (MeOH). The 7-d exposure was followed by a 7-d depuration， during which food containing antibiotics was replaced with solvent control food. Brain mRNAseq was ran to assess effects of antibiotics on the transcriptome of the brain. Briefly， flash-frozen brain tissue was extracted for high-quality RNA using RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit with QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen， Germany). Two samples of whole brain collected from each tank after 7 d， were extracted and pooled at equimolar amounts with measurement using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher， USA). Extracted RNA was assessed for RNA integrity number (RIN) using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies， Germany) with all values being â¥ 6.5 with a mean Â± standard deviation of 7.84 Â± 0.875. Samples were then shipped on dry ice to Genome Quebec Innovation Centre for paired-end sequencing (2x100)， using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Quality control of resulting sequence output was conducted using FastQC， and reads were assessed for quality， then trimmed to a minimum Phred score of 20 and a minimum length of 35 bases using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al.， 2014). The abundance of transcripts was estimated using Salmon (version 1.10.2) with the reference RBT transcriptome USDA_OmykA_1.1 (GenBank Acc. no.

CD38+ Alveolar Macrophages mediate early control of M.tuberculosis proliferation in the lung [CITE-seq],GSE245950,Mus musculus,Tuberculosis， caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb)， remains an enduring global health challenge， especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However， the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underexplored. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb， the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study， by integrating the use of weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) modules with our multi-modal scRNA-seq protocol， we were able to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints， allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations throughout the infection timeline.Our analyses during specific post-Mtb challenge intervals revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably， CD38- AMs showed a muted response to early Mtb infection. As infection progressed， we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs， with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Interestingly， scATAC-seq analysis of naÃ¯ve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection， indicative of epigenetic priming， and predisposed them to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages， substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth.Collectively， our findings emphasize the pivotal， dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies， with implications for the broader field of infectious diseases.,Mice were intranasally inoculated with 1500 CFUs of the Erdman strains (smycâ²::mCherry， hspxâ²::GFP/smycâ²::mCherry， or hsp60â²::GFP).

Mitigation of chromosome loss in clinical CRISPR-Cas9-engineered T cells [CROPSeq_Data],GSE241882,Homo sapiens,CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has enabled advanced T cell therapies， but occasional loss of the targeted chromosome remains a safety concern. To investigate whether Cas9-induced chromosome loss is a universal phenomenon and evaluate its clinical significance， we conducted a systematic analysis in primary human T cells. Arrayed and pooled CRISPR screens revealed that chromosome loss was generalizable across the genome and resulted in partial and entire loss of the chromosome， including in pre-clinical chimeric antigen receptor T cells. T cells with chromosome loss persisted for weeks in culture， implying the potential to interfere with clinical use. A modified cell manufacturing process， employed in our first-in-human clinical trial of Cas9-engineered T cells， dramatically reduced chromosome loss while largely preserving genome editing efficacy. Expression of p53 correlated with protection from chromosome loss observed in this protocol， suggesting both a mechanism and strategy for T cell engineering that mitigates this genotoxicity in the clinic.,Primary human T cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector (CROP-seq) containing a unique Cas9 guide RNA and co-expressing GFP at an MOI <0.3. After FACS to isolate GFP+ T cells， Cas9 protein was electroporated. Genome edited T cells were barcoded using MULTI-seq before pooling and performing 10x Genomics 3' scRNA-seq. Along with the MULTI-seq barcodes and gene expression data， the sequence of the guide RNA was also sequenced.,37794590,Cell

Molecular profiling of lymphatic endothelial cells activation in vitro,GSE247178,Homo sapiens,The lymphatic vascular system plays a key role in cancer progression. Indeed， the activation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) through the lymphangiogenic process allows the formation of new lymphatic vessels (LVs) that represent the major route for dissemination of solid tumors. This process is governed by a plethora of cancer-derived and microevironmental mediators that strictly activate and control specific molecular pathways in LECs. In this work we used an in vitro model of LEC activation to trigger lymphangiogenesis using a mix of recombinant pro-lymphangiogenic factors (VFS) and a co-culture system with human melanoma cells. Both systems efficiently activated LECs， and under these experimental conditions RNA sequencing was exploited to unveil the transcriptional profile of activated LECs.  Our data demonstrate that both recombinant and tumor cell-mediated activation trigger significant molecular pathways associated with endothelial activation， morphogenesis and cytokine-mediated signaling. In addition， this system provides information on new genes to be further investigated in the lymphangiogenesis process and open the possibility for further exploitation in other tumor contexts where lymphatic dissemination plays a relevant role.,RNA-Seq of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) activated by a mix of recombinant pro-lymphangiogenic factors and an RNA-Seq of LEC a co-cultured with human melanoma cells.

Clonal barcoding of endogenous adult hematopoietic stem cells reveals a spectrum of lineage contributions,GSE246271,Mus musculus,The hierarchical model of hematopoiesis posits that self-renewing， multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all blood cell lineages. While this model accounts for hematopoiesis in transplant settings， its applicability to steady-state hematopoiesis remains to be clarified. Here we used inducible clonal DNA barcoding of endogenous adult HSCs to trace their contribution to major hematopoietic cell lineages in unmanipulated animals. Whereas the majority of barcodes were unique to a single lineage， we also observed frequent barcode sharing between multiple lineages， specifically between lymphocytes and myeloid cells. These results suggest a spectrum of multipotent and unipotent HSCs that collectively drive continuous hematopoiesis in the adult， and highlight a close relationship of myeloid and lymphoid development.,For transposon integration site cloning， bone marrow cells and thymocytes were isolated from the Pdzk1ip1CreERR26FlipJump mice at months 6 and 10 post tamoxifen induction.

Multiomic spatial landscape of innate immune cells at human central nervous system borders,GSE245311,Homo sapiens,The innate immune system of the human central nervous system (CNS) is highly diverse already during homeostasis. Several immune cell populations such as macrophages that are frequent in the brain parenchyma (microglia) and less numerous at the brain interfaces as CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) constitute the local immune compartment. Due to their scantiness and particular location， little is known about the presence of temporally and spatially restricted CAM subclasses during development， health and perturbation. Here， we combined several high-dimensional technologies， such as single-cell RNA-sequencing， time-of-flight mass cytometry and single-cell spatial transcriptomics with fate mapping and advanced immunohistochemistry to comprehensively characterize the immune system at human CNS interfaces. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of resident and engrafted myeloid cells in the brains of individuals with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation， revealing remarkable dynamics. These approaches enabled us to identify a previously unappreciated spectrum of transcriptional classes of human CAMs and to decipher their turnover with circulating cells. CAM signatures profoundly changed during ontogeny and pathology. Our results highlight myeloid diversity at the interfaces of the human CNS with the periphery and provide new insights into the human brainâs immune system.,Single-cell RNA sequencing using 10x and Cel-Seq2 was conducted on cell suspensions and after nuclei extraction from fresh frozen sections or formalin-fixed formalin embedded tissues.

Lineage regulators TFAP2C and NR5A2 function as bipotency activators in totipotent embryos,GSE216256,Mus musculus,During the first lineage segregation， a mammalian totipotent embryo differentiates into inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). However， how transcription factors (TFs) regulate this earliest cell fate decision in vivo remains elusive， with their regulomes primarily inferred from cultured cells. Here， we investigated the TF regulomes during the first mouse lineage specification across 6 stages， spanning the pre-initiation， initiation， commitment， and maintenance phases. Unexpectedly， we found TFAP2C， a trophoblast regulator， bound and activated both early TE and ICM genes at the totipotent (2-8-cell) stages (âbipotency activationâ). Tfap2c deficiency caused downregulation of early ICM genes， including Nanog， Nr5a2， Tdgf1， and early TE genes， including Tfeb and Itgb5 in 8-cell embryos. Transcription defects in both ICM and TE lineages were also found in blastocysts， accompanied by increased apoptosis and reduced cell numbers in ICMs. Upon trophoblast commitment， TFAP2C left early-ICM genes but acquired binding to late-TE genes in blastocysts where it co-bound with CDX2， and later to extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE) genes where it cooperatively co-occupied with the former ICM regulator SOX2. Finally， âbipotency activationâ in totipotent embryos also applied to a pluripotency regulator NR5A2 which similarly bound and activated both ICM and TE lineage genes at the 8-cell stage. These data reveal a unique transcription circuity of totipotency underpinned by highly adaptable lineage regulators.,By employing CUT&RUN， RNA-seq， and ATAC-seq， we systematically examined the genome wide TFAP2C， CDX2 and SOX2 chromatin binding and transcriptional functions in mouse early embryos.,38243114,Nat Struct Mol Biol
mRNA-based precision targeting of neoantigens and tumor-associated antigens in malignant brain tumors,GSE252247,Mus musculus,mRNA-based immunotherapeutics have garnered widespread interest for their potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. In this study， we have established a personalized and customizable mRNA-therapeutic approach that effectively targets a plurality of tumor antigens and demonstrated potent anti-tumor response in preclinical brain tumor models. Our platform uniquely addresses the challenge of tumor heterogeneity and low antigen burden， two key deficiencies in targeting classically immunotherapy-resistant CNS malignancies.,We created GBM tumor antigen-specific RNA and loaded it into dendritic cells for anti-tumor vaccine. We performed in vivo anti-tumor efficacy study with antigen loaded dendritic cells in combination with adoptive T cell therapy with relevant controls in the KR158 murine GBM model. Post therapy， we isolated the CD45+ve immune cells and CD45 -ve tumor cells from the brain tumor microenvironment and performed scRNA-seq analysis. The samples from each treatment arm were multiplexed together to minimize batch effect. Each treatment arm had 4 replicates for CD45 +ve immune cell subset divided across 3 multiplexed pools and 1 combined replicate for CD45 -ve tumor cells multiplexed into 1 pool.,nan,
VGLL1 regulates extraembryonic lineage specification in human [CUT&TAG],GSE193618,Homo sapiens,Placenta abnormality is one of the key reasons for early pregnancy loss but the regulatory mechanisms underlying placenta formation are largely unknown. Here， we applied a human naÃ¯ve pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derived TE model to explore the driven regulatory machinery. We demonstrate that VGLL1 (vestigialÂ likeÂ familyÂ memberÂ 1) is crucial for TE self-renewal and TE-specific gene expression， thus suppressing VGLL1 leads to severely impaired cell proliferation and skewed TE induction. VGLL1 exerts its function through interacting with TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) and colocalize at target gene promoters and enhancers. Further investigation uncovers the enrichment of H3K27ac active histone marks at genomic regions occupied by VGLL1-TEAD4 complex， indicates a close association between them. Overall， our data reveals the critical function model of VGLL1-TEAD4 in human TE derivation， highlighting a potential interspecies difference between human and mouse TE induction.,Human naÃ¯ve PSC were plated at a density of 100000 cells per well onextracellular matrix (ECM; Geltrexâ¢)-coated 6-well plates and cultured with TE medium.

Cells cultured in TSC medium became morphologically stable after 2-3 passages.,38233381,Nat Commun
Temporal genomic analysis of melanoma rejection identifies regulators of tumor immune evasion [scc],GSE247058,Mus musculus,Decreased intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) correlates with increased patient survival and immunotherapy response. However， the mechanism underlying this association remains inconclusive since additional factors dictate tumor aggressiveness. Here， we study the mechanisms responsible for the immune escape of tumors bearing low ITH. We compare homogeneous， genetically similar single-cell clones that are rejected vs. non-rejected after transplantation. We followed the growth of these clone-derived tumors over time using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping. Non-rejected clones show high infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)， increased Mif expression， lower T-cell infiltration， and increased T-cell exhaustion. Mif KO led to smaller tumors and reversed these immune phenotypes， validating its role in the growth of low ITH tumors. Mif secretion by these tumor cells causes TAM infiltration， thus contributing to an immunosuppressive environment that supports aggressive growth. We validated this result in melanoma patient data， confirming that high levels of MIF distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive ITHs.,Live cells were sorted from tumor samples， hashed， and profiled with single-cell RNA-seq on the 10x Genomics platform.,39873477,Cancer Discov
ZNF714 â a novel oncogene in lung cancer cells [RNA-seq],GSE238067,Homo sapiens,Despite the ongoing progress in diagnosis and treatments， cancer remains a threat to more than one-third of the human population. It is a complex disorder characterized by multi-omic aberrations affecting cell proliferation， death， migration， plasticity， interaction with the immune system， and other features. The emerging data indicate that many KRAB-ZNF factors belonging to a large gene family may be involved in carcinogenesis. Our previous study identified ZNF714， a KRAB-ZNF gene of unknown function， as commonly overexpressed in many tumors， pointing to its hypothetical oncogenic role. Here， we harnessed the TCGA-centered online databases， performed functional studies and transcriptomic and methylomic profiling to test this hypothesis， and explore ZNF714 function in cancer. Our pan-cancer analyses confirmed that ZNF714 is frequently upregulated in multiple tumors， possibly as a result of regional amplification， promoter hypomethylation， and NFYB signaling. We also showed that ZNF714 expression correlates with tumor immunosuppressive features. The in vitro studies indicated that ZNF714 expression positively associates with proliferation， migration， and invasion. In line with these observations， the transcriptomic analysis of ZNF714 knocked-down cells demonstrated deregulation of cell adhesion， migration， proliferation， apoptosis， and differentiation. Importantly， we provided evidence that ZNF714 negatively regulates the expression of a number of known TSGs via promoter methylation. However， as ZNF714 did not show nuclear localization in our research model， the regulatory mechanisms exerted by ZNF714 require further investigation. In conclusion， our results reveal， for the first time， that ZNF714 may have oncogenic functions.,We analyzed 6 samples from two different lung cancer cell lines in biological triplicates (total 18 samples). For each cell line (H2073 and SKMES) we analyzed unmodified cells (WT)， cells with knocked-down expression of ZNF714 (shZNF714) and cells carrying control shRNA sequence (shLUC).Pair-end RNA sequencing was performed for all samples on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina).

Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from children with active idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) and healthy controls (HC) [HC_vs_INS],GSE233275,Homo sapiens,An autoimmune B cell origin for childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is predicted based on the efficacy of rituximab (RTX) at maintaining long-term remission from proteinuria. Knowledge regarding the nature of the culprit B cell response is very limited. In particular， no transcriptomics work has been performed to evaluate the B cell response in INS. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from four affected children with active INS and four age/sex-matched health controls (HC)， we demonstrate that a B cell transcriptional program poised for effector functions represents the major immune perturbation in the blood of children with active INS. We show that this nephrotic B cell signature is conferred by the engagement of memory B cells through an extrafollicular developmental route defined by expression of the interfollicular-homing gene GPR183 and the expansion of atypical B cells and marginal zone-like B cells. Moreover， we show that genes involved in APRIL signaling， which promotes extrafollicular antibody-secreting cell development， were substantially upregulated in B cells， monocytes， and dendritic cells from INS children. Collectively， our study provides evidence for an extrafollicular origin for humoral immunity in active INS.,PBMC were isolated from the blood of four children at either first onset or relapse of INS and four healthy age-matched controls. Live lymphocytes and monocytes were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq).,37996443,Nat Commun
ZFP281 coordinates DNMT3 and TET1 in pluripotent state transitions [ChIP-seq],GSE226040,Mus musculus,The progression and transition between the naÃ¯ve， formative， and primed pluripotent states are accompanied by a sharp activation of the de novo DNA methyltransferases and the reorganization of transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes. Here we identified Zinc Finger Protein 281 (ZFP281) as an essential factor in the formative-to-primed pluripotent state transition. Using a knockout mouse model and a knockin degron cell system， we revealed that transcription of Dnmt3a/3b depends on the activity of ZFP281 in embryonic stem cells， epiblast-like cells， and epiblast stem cells. Mechanically， chromatin-bound ZFP281 and DNA hydroxylase TET1 are decreased in the formative state but recovered in the primed state to compete with DNMT3A/3B for establishing the DNA methylation and gene expression programs of primed pluripotency. In addition， chromatin occupancy of ZFP281 and TET1 depend on the R-loop structures formed at the ZFP281 target gene promoters devoid of DNA methylation. Our study demonstrates a comprehensive role of ZFP281 in modulating DNA methylation and demethylation for the establishment and maintenance of primed pluripotency.,ChIP-seq of ZFP281 and TET1 in pluripotent stem cells,38237590,Dev Cell

Chromatin priming elements direct tissue-specific gene activity prior to hematopoietic specification,GSE244338,Mus musculus,Tissue-specific gene regulation during development involves the interplay between transcription factors and epigenetic regulators binding to enhancer and promoter elements. The pattern of active enhancers defines the cellular differentiation state. However， developmental gene activation involves a previous step called chromatin priming which is not fully understood. We recently developed a genome-wide functional assay that allowed us to functionally identify enhancer elements integrated in chromatin regulating each of five stages spanning the in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells to blood. We also measured global chromatin accessibility， histone modifications and transcription factor binding. The integration of these data identified and characterised cis-regulatory elements which become activated prior to the onset of gene expression， some of which are primed in a signalling-dependent fashion. Deletion of such a priming element leads to a delay in the upregulation of its associated gene in development. Our work uncovers the details of a complex network of regulatory interactions with the dynamics of early chromatin opening being at the heart of dynamic tissue-specific gene expression control.,Targeted DNA sequencing of fragment libraries cloned into an enhancer reporter cassette in the HPRT locus of HM-1 ES cells and their differentiated progeny.

Unified analysis of DNA methylation， hydroxymethylation and chromatin accessibility through targeted DNA labeling [TOP-Seq],GSE231928,Mus musculus,Epigenetic regulation depends on complex interactions between different epigenetic factors， such as DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. As the gene activation potential cannot be predicted by looking at chromatin accessibility or DNA modification alone， methods capable of relating multiple factors are highly desirable. Existing methods for combined chromatin accessibility and DNA modification analysis rely on bisulfite sequencing， which has a number of well known drawbacks. We developed a novel cost-efficient method for simultaneous profiling of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation within open chromatin loci. Our approach is based on chemo-enzymatic covalent tagging of unmodified (uCG) and hydroxymethylated (5hmC) CG sites along with GC sites in native chromatin， which are then mapped by tag-selective sequencing. Validation of the technology on model DNA systems and mammalian cells demonstrated a great applicability of this method for epigenomic studies. We employed the technology for tracking chromatin dynamics combined with changes of two different cytosine states， unmodified and hydroxymethylated， during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) which revealed extensive chromatin dynamics and DNA modification changes across gene bodies of development-associated genes at early transition from ESC. Strong DNA demethylation in the ESC-to-neuron differentiation pathway proceeds independently from cell transcriptional programs and highlights the value of separate 5hmC and 5mC analysis in understanding cell fate decisions.,We performed differentiation of mouse ESC (mESC) into a population of radial-glial neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) and later into terminally differentiated glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (NC). 1*105 nuclei extracted from three developmental stages cells were used for double uCG- and GC-， 5hmC- and GC-azide and triple CG-， GC-alkyne， and 5hmC-azide labeling reactions.,38154461,Cell Chem Biol
A SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS UNRAVELS THE HETEROGENEITY OF PRIMARY CULTURED HUMAN CORNEAL ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,GSE227942,Homo sapiens,The corneas is a transparent and avascular tissue located in front of the eye. Its inner surface is lined by a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells (CECs)， which maintain the cornea transparent. CECs remain arrested at a non-proliferative state and damage to these cells can compromise their function leading to corneal opacity. The primary culture of donor-derived CECs is a promising cell therapy. It confers the potential to treat multiple patients from a single donor， alleviating the global donor shortage. Nevertheless， this approach has limitations preventing its adoption， particularly culture protocols allow limited expansion of CECs and there is a lack of clear parameters to identify therapy-grade CECs. To address this limitation， a better understanding of the molecular changes arising from the primary culture of CECs is required. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on primary cultured CECs， we identify their variable transcriptomic fingerprint at the single cell level， provide a pseudo temporal reconstruction of the changes arising from primary culture， and suggest markers to assess the quality of primary CEC cultures. This research depicts a deep transcriptomic understanding of the cellular heterogeneity arising from the primary expansion of CECs and sets the basis for further improvement of culture protocols and therapies.,Research-grade donor human corneas and ethical statementThis study was performed in compliance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All research-grade human donor corneas used for primary culture were obtained from the Lions Eye Institute for Transplant & Research (Tampa， USA)， with informed consent from the next of kin. The research involving human-derived corneas was performed in accordance to Maastricht University and Dutch national regulations. All corneas had an endothelial cell density of at least 2800 cells/mm2， deemed unsuitable for transplantation， and were preserved in Optisol-GS at 4Â°C for up to 14 days prior to their use (Table 1). No corneas were procured from prisoners.Isolation and culture of primary human corneal endothelial cellsSix paired corneas， from two male and one female donor aged 27 to 34 years， were used for isolation and primary culture of endothelial cells. Donors had no history of ocular disease， chronic systemic disease， or pathological infection such as HIV， Hepatitis B and C， HTLV-I/II， syphilis， or SARS-CoV-2.Prior to isolation， the endothelialâDescemetâs corneal layer was manually stripped as follows: the corneas were vacuum fixed in a punch base (e.janach) endothelial cell side up and trephined with a 10 mm Ã corneal punch at a fixed depth of 100 Î¼m (e.janach). To delimit the endothelial trephined line， corneas were stained with a trypan blue solution (0.4%) for 30 s， and washed with balanced salt solution sterile irrigating solution (BSS; Alcon). The corneal endothelium was then gently lifted using a DMEK cleavage hook (e.janach) and fully stripped using angled McPherson tying forceps.âHuman corneal endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as previously reported.5 Briefly， the stripped endotheliumâDescemetâs layer was incubated with 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche) solution in human endothelial serum free media (SFM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2â5 h at 37Â°C followed by a 5 min incubation in TrypLE express (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate small clumps of corneal endothelial cells. Cells from each cornea were seeded equally across 2 wells of a 24-well plate coated with fibronectin collagen (FNC) coating mix (Athena Enzyme Systems) in M5 stabilization media (human endothelial SFM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)， 100 U/mL penicillinâstreptomycin， and 0.25 Î¼g/mL amphotericin B) supplemented with 10 Î¼M Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies). Subsequently， corneal endothelial cells were cultured in M4 proliferation medium (1:1 Hamâs F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and M199 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% FBS， 20 Î¼g/mL ascorbic acid (Sigma)， 1 Ã ITS (Thermo Fisher Scientific)， 10 ng/mL human recombinant bFGF (Sigma)， and 10 Î¼M Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies)); media was refreshed every other day. Upon reaching 90% confluency， after approximately 8â10 days of culture， cells were cultured in M5 stabilization media for 7 days. After this， corneal endothelial cells were treated with TripLE express and passaged into wells pre-coated with FNC-coating mix at a seeding density of 10，500 cells/cm2 in M5 stabilization medium. All cell culture was performed in incubators with humidified atmosphere of 37Â°C and 5% CO2.Preparation of single cell suspension and methanol fixationCells from five different culture time points were methanol fixed for sequencing. Namely， cells at days 2 and 5 of culture after isolation in M4 proliferation media at passage 0， and cells at confluency after 7 days of culture in M5 stabilization media， at passages 0， 1， and 2.âTo generate a single cell suspension， primary cultured corneal endothelial cells were treated with TripLE express for approximately 30 min at 37Â°C. Then cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 Ã g and resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold Dulbeccoâs phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). Next， the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 Ã g and resuspended in ice-cold DPBS at a ratio of 200 Î¼L DPBS/1 Ã 106 cells， followed by the dropwise addition of ice-cold methanol at a ratio of 800 Î¼L DPBS/ 1 Ã 106 cells. The fixed cell suspensions were stored at -80Â°C until sequencing.Single-cell RNA sequencingscRNAseq of primary cultured CECs was performed at Single Cell Discoveries (Utrecht， the Netherlands) following standard 10Ã Genomics 3â V3.1 chemistry protocol. Cells were rehydrated and loaded on the 10Ã Chromium controller as follows. Approximately 10，000 cells were loaded per each sample specified in Table 2. The resulting sequencing libraries were prepared following a standard 10Ã Genomics protocol and sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform; read length: 150 bp， paired-end.,37291161,Sci Rep
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals glial cells integrate homeostatic and circadian processes to drive sleep-wake cycle,GSE221239,Drosophila melanogaster,The sleep-wake cycle is determined by a circadian and a sleep homeostatic process. However， the molecular impact of these two processes and their interaction on different cell populations in the brain remain unknown. To fill this gap， we have profiled the single-cell transcriptome of adult fruit fly brains across the sleep-wake cycle and different circadian times. We show cell type-specific transcriptomic changes between sleep/wakefulness states， different levels of sleep drive， and varying circadian times， with glial cells displaying the largest variations. Furthermore， the cell types whose transcriptomic dynamics correlate with the sleep homeostat or circadian clock are largely non-overlapping， with the exception of glial cells. Diminishing the circadian clock only in glial cells impairs the homeostatic sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. These findings reveal a comprehensive picture of different effects of sleep homeostatic and circadian processes on different cell types and define glial cells as the interaction sites of these two processes to determine sleep-wake dynamics.,Single-cell RNA-seq (10X Genomics) on adult Drosophila brain at different sleep， wake， sleep deprivation and Zeitgeber (ZT) times,38263460,Nat Neurosci
Mixed hepatocellular â cholangiocarcinoma derives from liver progenitor cells and depends on senescence and IL6 trans-signaling， single-cell RNA sequencing,GSE202089,Mus musculus,Mixed hepatocellular â cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) is a highly malignant primary liver cancer of increasing incidence for which the cell of origin and molecular pathogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. Here， by linking YFP to the progenitor cell specific promoter of Foxl1 in Mdr2-KO mice， we generated a lineage tracing mouse model for liver cancer to monitor the development of mixed HCC-CCA tumors following a prolonged period of liver inflammation. In this model of chronic hepatitis， we demonstrate that liver progenitor cells are the source of mixed HCC-CCA tumors but not of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover， we show that IL6， originating from senescent hepatic cells， is involved in progenitor cell proliferation and development of mixed HCC-CCA tumors via IL6 trans-signaling. These findings could form the basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of mixed HCC-CCA liver cancer.,Cells from non-tumor tissue， HCC tumor and HCC-CCA mixed tumor were prepared for single-cell RNA-Seq， one sample from each source.,35988690,J Hepatol
Histone Reader BRWD1 Targets and Restricts Recombination to the Igk Locus,GSE63302,Mus musculus,B lymphopoiesis requires that immunoglobulin genes be accessible to RAG1-RAG2 recombinase. However， the RAG proteins bind widely to open chromatin， which suggests that additional mechanisms must restrict RAG-mediated DNA cleavage. Here we show that developmental downregulation of interleukin 7 (IL-7)-receptor signaling in small pre-B cells induced expression of the bromodomain-family member BRWD1， which was recruited to a specific epigenetic landscape at Igk dictated by preâBCR-dependent Erk activation. BRWD1 enhanced RAG recruitment， increased gene accessibility and positioned nucleosomes 5â² to each JÎº recombination signal sequence. BRWD1 thus targets recombination to Igk and places recombination within the context of signaling cascades that control B cell development. Our findings represent a paradigm in which，at any particular antigen-receptor locus， specialized mechanisms enforce lineage- and stage-specific recombination.,ChIP-seq for 1 transcription factor and 2 histone modifications in flow purified mouse small pre-B cells.

Characterisation of ER-beta functions in prostate cancer (ATAC-Seq),GSE252577,Homo sapiens,To investigate the effect of a novel ER-beta selective ligand alone and with Enzalutamide on chromatin accessabilty in prostate cell lines,Cells were treated cells in the presence of OSU-ERb-12 alone (100 nM) or E2 alone (100nM)， Enza (1 microMolar) or the combinations for 6h. Briefly， 50x103 cells were resuspended in 50ul of ATAC-resuspension buffer (ATAC-RSB - 10mM Tris-HCl， 10mM NaCl， 3mM MgCl2) containing (0.1% NP-40， 0.1% tween-20， and 0.01% digitonin) and pipetted up and down 3 times. Further， 1ml of ATAC-wash-resuspension buffer (ATAC-RSB + 0.1% tween 20) was used to pellet down the nuclei.

Single-cell multi-omics decodes regulatory programs during development of mouse secondary palate II,GSE250247,Mus musculus,Perturbations in gene regulation during palatogenesis can lead to cleft palate， which is among the most common congenital birth defects. However， currently there is no comprehensive multiomics map of the developing secondary palate. Here， we perform single-cell multiome sequencing and profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression simultaneously within the same cells (n = 36，154) isolated from mouse secondary palate across embryonic days (E) 12.5， E13.5， E14.0， and E14.5. We construct five trajectories representing continuous differentiation of cranial neural crest-derived multipotent cells into distinct lineages. By linking open chromatin signals to gene expression changes， we characterize the underlying lineage-determining transcription factors. In silico perturbation analysis identifies transcription factors SHOX2 and MEOX2 as important regulators of the development of the anterior and posterior palate， respectively. In conclusion， our study chart epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics in palatogenesis， serving as a valuable resource for further cleft palate research.,The anterior (n=2) and posterior (n=2) 1/3 palatal shelves of E14.0 C57BL/6J mice were microdissected， isolated， and then subjected to ChIP-seq with either SHOX2 antibody (JK-6E) (sc-81955， Santa Cruz)， MEOX2 Antibody (A-8) (Sc-376748， Santa Cruz)， or normal rabbit IgG (2729， Cell Signaling Technology) as a negative control. The ChIP assays were performed according to the manufactureâs instruction using SimpleChIPÂ® Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Magnetic Beads) (9003， CST). Two independent ChIPs were conducted for library generation for each group.,38280850,Nat Commun
Negative reciprocal regulation between SIRT1 and Per2 in circadian clock during aging (ChIP-Seq),GSE54449,Mus musculus,SIRT1 is involved in both aging and circadian clock regulation， yet the link between the two processes in relation to SIRT1 function is unclear. Analyzing SIRT1-deficient cells and mice， we demonstrated that SIRT1 and Per2 constitute a reciprocal negative regulation loop that plays important roles in modulating circadian rhythmicity， metabolism and aging. SIRT1-deficient mice exhibit profound premature aging and enhanced H4K16 acetylation in the promoter of Per2 leading to its overexpression; in turn， Per2 suppresses SIRT1 transcription through binding to SIRT1 promoter at the CLOCK/BMAL1 site. We further demonstrated that absence of SIRT1 or ectopic overexpression of Per2 in the liver resulted in an accelerated pace of circadian rhythm and dysregulated amplitude， mimicking the natural process of circadian shortening in aged mice. Thus the interplay between SIRT1 and Per2 provides a link between the life-long sequence of aging and circadian clock maintenance.,To test whether changes in gene expression induced by Sirt1 KO are associated with changes in H4K16ac level at promoters， we profiled gene expression by using microarray and genomic binding of H4K16ac by using ChIP-Seq for Sirt1 KO mice and wild type control month (3-month).,27346580,Sci Rep

Autism genes converge on microtubule biology and RNA-binding proteins during excitatory neurogenesis,GSE250378,Homo sapiens,Recent studies have identified a large number of high confidence (hc) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genes. Systems biological and functional analyses have consistently implicated excitatory neurogenesis. However， the extent to which hcASD genes are involved in this process has not been explored systematically nor have the underlying biological pathways. Here， we leveraged CROP-Seq to repress 87 hcASD genes in an in vitro model of cortical neurogenesis. We identified 17 hcASD genes whose repression significantly alters developmental trajectory and results in a common cell state characterized by disruptions in proliferation and differentiation， cell cycle occupancy， mitotic spindle and microtubule biology， and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). We also identified over 3，000 differentially expressed genes， 286 of which have expression profiles correlated with changes in developmental trajectory. Collectively， these genes again highlight microtubule biology and RBPs. Overall， we uncover transcriptional disruptions downstream of hcASD gene perturbations and correlate these disruptions with distinct differentiation phenotypes， while reinforcing neurogenesis， microtubule biology， and RBPs as convergent points of disruption in ASD.,iPSC derived neural progenitor cells and neurons expressing the CRISPRi machinery were sequenced using 10X Chromium v3 using a CROP-seq protocol at three timepoints during differentiation (D0， D2， D4).

Targeted Perturb-seq of regulators of the transcriptional network downstream of RAF-MAPK signaling [perturb_seq],GSE250558,Homo sapiens,In this study we use a (targeted) perturb seq experiment in which we knock out 22 transcription factors downstream of MAPK signalling in order to reconstruct the transcriptional network downstream of RAF/MAPK signaling.,HEK-RAF-ER were transduced with a pooled CRISPR/Cas9 library targeting 22 transcription factors and the RAF-ER transgene with 4 guides each. Additionally， 10 non-targeting controls and 10 safe-cutters were included as negative controls. After a period of editing， the RAF/MAPK pathway was induced by 4OHT (tamoxifen)， and single cell transcriptome gene expression and CRISPR libraries were generated using the 10x Chromium Single Cell 3' V3 with Feature Barcoding technology. Additionally， we performed targeted PCR amplification of 140 genes that yielded better coverage of these genes. These dial-out libraries were sequenced seperately.,nan,
Highly cooperative chimeric super-SOX induces naÃ¯ve pluripotency across species [RNA-Seq],GSE247049,Homo sapiens,Our understanding of pluripotency remains limited: iPSC generation has only been established for a few model species， pluripotent stem cell lines exhibit inconsistent developmental potential， and germline transmission demonstrated only for mice and rats.  By swapping structural elements between Sox2 and Sox17， we built a chimeric super-SOX factor， Sox2-17， that enhanced iPSC generation in five tested species: mouse， human， cynomolgus monkey， cow， and pig. A swap of alanine to valine at the interface between Sox2 and Oct4 delivered a remarkable gain-of-function by stabilizing Sox2/Oct4 dimerization on DNA， enabling generation of high-grade OSKM iPSCs capable of supporting the development of healthy all-iPSC mice.  Sox2/Oct4 dimerization emerged as the core driver of naÃ¯ve pluripotency with its levels diminished upon priming. Transient overexpression of Sox2-17 and Klf4 (S*K cocktail) restored the dimerization and boosted the developmental potential of pluripotent stem cells across species， providing a universal method for naÃ¯ve reset in mammals.,To investigate the effects of SOX2AV and SOX2-17 on the fidelity of reprogramming， we generated and characterized 30 hiPSC lines using episomal reprogramming of new-born foreskin (young， Y) and 56-year-old male dermal (old， O， AG04148) fibroblasts. For episomal reprogramming 5x10^5 fibroblasts were nucleofected with 3 Î¼g of plasmid DNA mix: pCXLE-SOX2-P2A-KLF4 (Addgene ID 193292)， pCXLE-SOX2AV-p2a-KLF4 (Addgene ID193291) pCXLE-SOX2-17-P2A-KLF4 (Addgene ID 193290)， pCXLE-L-MYC-F2A-LIN28 (ML， Addgene ID 27080)， pCXLE-hOCT4-shTP53 (Addgene ID 27077)， pCXWB-EBNA1 (Addgene ID 37624) using Lonza NHDF Nucleofector kit (U-23 program)， and plated in ROCKi-containing fibroblast media on a CF1 feeder layer. All the selected clonal iPSC lines were integration-free with normal karyotypes. The hiPSC samples were collected at passage 10-12， at day 3 after plating on Matrigel (Cornig) in StemFlex media (Gibco).,38141611,Cell Stem Cell

A Unified Framework for Systematic Identification of Post-Transcriptional Regulatory Modules [perturb_seq],GSE225807,Homo sapiens,RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are multifunctional regulators of gene expression with complex and context-dependent mechanisms of action， yet the regulatory grammar that underlies RBP-mediated functions remains underexplored. Here， we performed a multi-omic data integration to systematically decipher the context-specific functions of RBPs. First， we report a compendium of in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) datasets of 50 human RBPs， which we used to generate a large-scale map of RBP protein neighborhoods. In parallel， we took advantage of CRISPR-interference with single-cell RNA-seq read-out (Perturb-seq) to capture rich transcriptomic phenotypes downstream of each RBP knockdown. By combining these physical and functional interaction readouts， along with the ENCODE transcriptome-wide atlas of RBP binding sites from eCLIP assays， we generated an integrated map of functional RBP interactions. This map not only captures well-studied post-transcriptional processes， but also reveals numerous previously unknown RBP-mediated regulatory functions. For a number of these cases， we have validated their predicted context-specific RBP functions using biochemical and genetic approaches. By deciphering these complex modes of functional interactions between RBPs， we have taken the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory processes and their underlying molecular grammar.,We obtained transcriptome-wide gene expression measurements for 68 RBPs (representing a variety of regulatory processes) knockdowns using single-cell RNA sequencing and used the resulting high-dimensional data to systematically delineate genetic interactions between RBPs.  Perturb-seq experiment was performed as previously described (Datlinger et al. 2017).,nan,

3D gene regulation network in glioma ferroptosis,GSE236253,Homo sapiens,Erastin is a small molecular compound which inhibits the system Xc- and prevents the import of cystine， reducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity， and finally inducing cell death via ferroptosis. To establish a model of Erastin induced ferroptosis in glioma cells， U87 cells were treated of Erastin (10 Î¼M， 72 h). Combination analysis of HiChIP， ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data suggests that change of chromatin loops mediated by 3D chromatin structure regulate gene expressions in glioma ferroptosis. Genes that regulated by 3D chromatin structure include genes that were reported function in ferroptosis like MDM2 and TXRND1. We propose a new regulatory mechanism governing glioma cell ferroptosis by 3D chromatin structure.,2 biological replicates were analyzed for Erastin-treated glioma U87 cells (10 Î¼M， 72 h) and control U87 cells by RNA-seq， 2 biological replicates of H3K27ac ChIP-seq for U87， 2 biological replicates of H3K27ac ChIP-seq for Erastin (10 Î¼M， 72 h)-treated U87 cells， 2 biological replicates of H3K4me1 ChIP-seq for U87， 2 biological replicates of H3K4me1 ChIP-seq for Erastin (10 Î¼M， 72 h)-treated U87 cells，  2 biological replicates of H3K27ac HiChIP for U87， 2 biological replicates of H3K27ac HiChIP for Erastin (10 Î¼M， 72 h)-treated U87 cells.,37834393,Int J Mol Sci
Maize transcriptional responses to specialist and generalist spider mite herbivores,GSE100121,Zea mays,Spider mites， including the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae， TSSM) and the Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis， BGM)， are becoming increasingly important agricultural pests. The TSSM is an extreme generalist documented to feed on more than 1100 plant hosts. In contrast， the BGM is a grass specialist， with hosts including important cereal crops like maize， wheat， and sorghum. Historically， studies of plant-herbivore interactions have focused largely on insects. As such， far less is known about plant responses to spider mite herbivores， especially in grasses， and whether responses differ between generalist and specialist mites. To identify plant defense pathways responding to spider mites， we collected time course RNA-seq data from maize (Zea mays) infested with TSSMs and BGMs. Additionally， and as a comparison to the physical damage caused by spider mite feeding， a wounding treatment was also included. In total， four biological samples were generated per treatment.,The experiment was performed with four biological replicates across each of the following (28 samples in total): no infestation (C， control)， 2hr after wounding (W2)， 24hr after wounding (W24)， 2hr after TSSM infestation (T2)， 24hr after TSSM infestation (T24)， 2hr after BGM infestation (B2)， and 24hr after BGM infestation (B24).,30186298,Front Plant Sci

Mouse regulatory DNA landscapes reveal global principles of cis-regulatory evolution,GSE51336,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,To study the evolutionary dynamics of regulatory DNA， we mapped >1.3 million deoxyribonuclease Iâhypersensitive sites (DHSs) in 45 mouse cell and tissue types， and systematically compared these with human DHS maps from orthologous compartments. We found that the mouse and human genomes have undergone extensive cis-regulatory rewiring that combines branch-specific evolutionary innovation and loss with widespread repurposing of conserved DHSs to alternative cell fates， and that this process is mediated by turnover of transcription factor (TF) recognition elements. Despite pervasive evolutionary remodeling of the location and content of individual cis-regulatory regions， within orthologous mouse and human cell types the global fraction of regulatory DNA bases encoding recognition sites for each TF has been strictly conserved. Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary forces shaping mammalian regulatory DNA landscapes.,To study the evolutionary dynamics of regulatory DNA， we mapped >1.3 million deoxyribonuclease Iâhypersensitive sites (DHSs) in 45 mouse cell and tissue types， and systematically compared these with human DHS maps from orthologous compartments.,25411453,Science

Time- and lineage-resolved transcriptional profiling uncovers gene expression programs and clonal relationships that underlie human T lineage specification,GSE248549,Homo sapiens,T cells develop from multi-potent hematopoietic progenitors in the thymus and provide adaptive protection against pathogens and cancer. However， the emergence of human T cell-competent blood progenitors， and their subsequent specification to the T lineage， has been challenging to capture in real time. Here， we leveraged a pluripotent stem cell differentiation system to understand the transcriptional dynamics and cell fate restriction events that underlie this critical developmental process. Time-resolved single cell RNA sequencing revealed that cell-cycle exit， downregulation of the multipotent hematopoietic program， and upregulation of >90 lineage-associated transcription factors all occur within a highly co-ordinated and narrow developmental window. Computational gene-regulatory network inference elucidated the transcriptional logic of T lineage specification， uncovering an important role for YBX1. We mapped the differentiation cell fate hierarchy using transcribed lineage barcoding and mathematical trajectory inference and discovered that mast and myeloid potential bifurcate from each other early in haematopoiesis， upstream of T lineage restriction. Collectively， our analyses provide a quantitative， time-resolved model of human T cell specification with relevance for regenerative medicine and developmental immunology.,For time course and lineage tracing experiments， the following âCord-blood-optimizedâ serum-free media was used for T cell differentiation; Iscoveâs modified Dulbeccoâs medium (IMDM) with GlutaMAX basal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific， 31980030) supplemented with 20% BIT 9500 serum substitute (STEMCELL Technologies， 09500)， 60 Î¼M ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich， A8960)， 24 Î¼M 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich， M3148)， 0.05% low-density lipoprotein (STEMCELL Technologies， 02698)， stem cell factor (SCF) (23.9 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 255-SC)， Flt3L (8.7 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 308-FK)， IL-3 (5.3 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 203-IL)， CXCL12 (9.7 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 350-NS)， IL-7 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 207-IL)， and TNFÎ± (4.9 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 210-TA). In parallel work that took place during the course of this study， we developed an improved âPSC-optimizedâ progenitor T cell differentiation media which supports more efficient survival. We therefore used this media for CRISPR perturbation experiments， and their associated controls， to maximise viable cell recovery. The improved media comprises IMDM with GlutaMAX basal media (Thermo Fisher Scientific， 31980030) with 4% B27 minus Vitamin A (Gibco， 12587010)， 60 ÂµM Ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich， A8960)， 24ÂµM 2-Mercaptoethanol， SCF (12.37 ng/ml)， Flt3L (8.61 ng/ml)， IL-3 (0.97 ng/ml; R&D Systems， 203-IL)， CXCL12 (97.39 ng/ml)， IL-7 (65.25 ng/ml)， and TNFÎ± (0.07 ng/ml).  Harvested cells from the EHT culture phase were pelleted， re-suspended in T cell differentiation media at a split ratio of 1:3 (unless otherwise specified)， and transferred in 100uL volume per well on to 96 well plates freshly coated with DLL4 and VCAM1 as described above . Cells were incubated at 37Â°C， 5% CO2. The media was topped up with an additional 100uL of media per well (bringing the total volume of media to 200uL) after 3 or 4 days of progenitor T cell differentiation. Cultures proceeded for up to a maximum of 7 days.  Timecourse dataset We performed a reverse differentiation time course such that new differentiations were initiated every 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Thus， samples representing each developmental time point could be collected at the same time for parallel capture. For each differentiation time point， we thawed an aliquot of the same cryopreserved stock of iPS11-derived hemogenic endothelial cells produced as described above. For each timepoint， at least 5 independent wells were seeded for downstream pooling. EHT cultures and progenitor T cell differentiations were performed as described above. On the final day of the timecourse， all timepoint samples were harvested and an additional aliquot of the input population was thawed. For samples from the progenitor T cell differentiation stage， cells were harvested by pipetting， whereas for the EHT timepoints， non-adherent cells were harvested by pipetting before adherent cells were harvested using 30uL per well of 0.25%Trypsin EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific， 25200072). For the sample coresponding to the passage day， adherent and floating cells were sequenced separately. Each sample was pelleted by centrifugation at 300x g for 5 minutes. Replicate wells were pooled together and washed with PBS. Samples were Fc blocked (BD， 564220) and labelled with zombie-UV viability dye (BioLegend， 423108) on ice in the dark for 20 minutes. Next， each sample was labelled with 0.1 ug of a cell hashing antibody (TotalSeq-B anti-human Hashtag antibodies 1 through 8， BioLegend). Cells were labelled for 30 minutes on ice in the dark. Next， samples were washed 3 times with HF buffer and counted prior to pooling. Samples were combined in to two pools， one for the EHT time points and another for the progenitor T cell differentiation time points. To enrich for Zombie-UV-negative viable cells， the EHT time point pool was subject to Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) using a MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter).  Lineage barcoding dataset In vitro differentiations from cryopreserved CD34+ cells were initiated as described above， with the modification that 7500 cells were seeded on to one well of 96 well plate for transduction and sampling while additional âproxyâ wells were seeded at the same density for flow cytometry analysis and estimating the cell count in the experimental well. Three days after seeding， cells were transduced with 3.75uL per well of the concentrated barcoding virus. Twenty-four hours later， wells the cells were fed with an additional 100uL per well of EHT media. Five days after seeding (48 hours after transduction)， the well was mixed by gentle pipetting and half of the total volume was sampled for scRNA sequencing (Chromium Single Cell 3â Reagents kit v3.1). One week following the initiation of the differentiation culture (4 days after transduction)， the remaining cells were collected and passaged 1:2 on to plates coated with DLL4 and VCAM1 in EHT media as described above. Three days later， remaining cells were harvested， counted and a sub-sample of 16，500 cells were taken for scRNA sequencing.,nan,
Strong Correlation of Gene Counts and Differentially Expressed Genes between a 3â² RNA-Seq and RNA Hybridisation Platform from Canine Archival Tissue [3' RNA-Seq],GSE261790,Canis lupus familiaris,3' RNA-Seq and direct RNA hybridisation are conceptually different approaches for high throughput transcriptome analysis. The former generates next-generation sequencing libraries by targeting and amplifying 3'-end sequences of 60 to 80 nucleotides in length， whereas the latter quantifies transcripts of 800 pre-selected genes. Since both methods are applicable to short mRNA fragments， they are thought to allow for transcriptome analyses from formalin-fixed， paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissue containing partially degraded RNA. In this study， results of both approaches were compared on sample- and gene-wise count levels， gene expression strength and direction， as well as the overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Using two different oncological perspectives， i.e. a stage-dependent and entity-contrasting comparison on 35 FFPE canine tumours， both methods proved suitable for their use on archival tissues. A moderately to very strong overall count correlation was found (range of Pearson and Spearman means: 0.66 â 0.87). Of note， the gene-wise count correlations depended on gene expression strength. Finally， in the entity-contrasting comparison， expression direction correlated very strongly (range: 0.88 â 0.91) but DEGs only moderately overlapped (Jaccard index: 0.53). Aside from these figures， different practically relevant aspects of the two technologies offer distinct advantages， depending on the objectives and design of a study. - Attention: this GEO submission includes the 3' RNA-Seq data from 25 of the 35 samples used in this study!

Shared inflammatory glial cell signature after brain injury， revealed by spatial， temporal and cell-type-specific profiling of the murine cerebral cortex [scRNA-Seq],GSE226207,Mus musculus,Traumatic brain injury leads to a highly orchestrated immune- and glial cell response partially responsible for long-lasting disability and the development of secondary neurodegenerative diseases.

Local regulation of gene expression by lncRNA promoters， transcription， and splicing,GSE85798,Mus musculus,Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed to produce thousands of spliced long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)， whose functions remain poorly understood. Because recent evidence has implicated several specific lncRNA loci in the local regulation of gene expression， we sought to determine whether such local regulation is a property of many lncRNA loci. We used genetic manipulations to dissect 12 genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and found that 5 of these loci influence the expression of a neighboring gene in cis. Surprisingly， however， none of these effects required the specific lncRNA transcripts themselves and instead involved general processes associated with their production， including enhancer-like activity of gene promoters， the process of transcription， and the splicing of the transcript. Interestingly， such effects are not limited to lncRNA loci: we found similar effects on local gene expression at 4 of 6 protein-coding loci. These results demonstrate that âcrosstalkâ among neighboring genes is a prevalent phenomenon that can involve multiple mechanisms and cis regulatory signals， including a novel role for RNA splice sites. These mechanisms may coordinate the expression of neighboring genes and explain the function and evolution of some genomic loci that produce lncRNAs.,We developed a genetic approach based on classical cis-trans tests to distinguish between (i) primary effects on the expression of nearby genes resulting from direct local functions of the lncRNA locus and (ii) secondary effects on nearby genes resulting from indirect downstream consequences of the lncRNA acting elsewhere in the cell. We generated clonal cell lines carrying heterozygous genetic modifications at lncRNA loci and compared the expression of nearby genes within 1 megabase on the cis and trans alleles (i.e.， on the modified and unmodified homologous chromosomes) in the same cells. Changes in neighboring gene expression that involve only the cis allele likely result from local functions， while changes that involve both the cis and trans alleles likely result as downstream effects of non-local functions. We performed genetic modifications in 129/Castaneus F1 hybrid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that contain ~1 polymorphic site every 140 basepairs (bp)， enabling us to distinguish the two alleles using RNA sequencing， and we checked for consistency between knockouts on each genetic background to control for potential haplotype-specific effects. We initially characterized allele-specific gene expression using RNA sequencing combined with hybrid selection， and we further characterized a subset of clones in selected loci using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq)， chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq)， and ATAC-Seq.,27783602,Nature
Cell type directed design of synthetic enhancers,GSE240003,Drosophila melanogaster;Homo sapiens,Transcriptional enhancers act as docking stations for combinations of transcription factors and thereby regulate spatiotemporal activation of their target genes. A single enhancer， of a few hundred base pairs in length， can autonomously and independently of its location and orientation drive cell-type specific expression of a gene or transgene. It has been a long-standing goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Recently， deep learning models have yielded unprecedented insight into the enhancer code， and well-trained models are reaching a level of understanding that may be close to complete. As a consequence， we hypothesized that deep learning models can be used to guide the directed design of synthetic， cell type specific enhancers， and that this process would allow for a detailed tracing of all enhancer features at nucleotide-level resolution. Here we implemented and compared three different design strategies， each built on a deep learning model: (1) directed sequence evolution; (2) directed iterative motif implanting; and (3) generative design. We evaluated the function of fully synthetic enhancers to specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We then exploited this concept further by creating âdual-codeâ enhancers that target two cell types， and minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully functional. By examining the trajectories followed during state space searches towards functional enhancers， we could accurately define the enhancer code as the optimal strength， combination， and relative distance of TF activator motifs， and the absence of TF repressor motifs. Finally， we applied the same three strategies to successfully design human enhancers， finding highly similar design principles as in Drosophila. In conclusion， enhancer design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to manipulate cell states.,Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for Zeb2 in MM001.

A Unified Framework for Systematic Identification of Post-Transcriptional Regulatory Modules [Ribosomal profiling],GSE225808,Homo sapiens,RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are multifunctional regulators of gene expression with complex and context-dependent mechanisms of action， yet the regulatory grammar that underlies RBP-mediated functions remains underexplored. Here， we performed a multi-omic data integration to systematically decipher the context-specific functions of RBPs. First， we report a compendium of in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) datasets of 50 human RBPs， which we used to generate a large-scale map of RBP protein neighborhoods. In parallel， we took advantage of CRISPR-interference with single-cell RNA-seq read-out (Perturb-seq) to capture rich transcriptomic phenotypes downstream of each RBP knockdown. By combining these physical and functional interaction readouts， along with the ENCODE transcriptome-wide atlas of RBP binding sites from eCLIP assays， we generated an integrated map of functional RBP interactions. This map not only captures well-studied post-transcriptional processes， but also reveals numerous previously unknown RBP-mediated regulatory functions. For a number of these cases， we have validated their predicted context-specific RBP functions using biochemical and genetic approaches. By deciphering these complex modes of functional interactions between RBPs， we have taken the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory processes and their underlying molecular grammar.,Ribosomal profiling of K562 TAF15 KD cells,nan,
Subgenome-specific usage of transposable element-derived promoters and enhancers in bread wheat development,GSE198284,Triticum aestivum;Triticum urartu,Transcription start site (TSS) is the hub integrating regulatory input from promoters and enhancers.

The transcriptome profiling of multi-cell types by the droplet based full-length single-cell transcript sequencing,GSE233170,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,We developed a scalable Tn5-based Full-Length In situ Transcriptome sequencing method (scFLIT-seq). This method combines the advantages of in situ reverse transcription of methanol-fixed cells， single-cell separation and barcode ligation via the 10X scATAC-seq protocol and microfluidic platform， and Tn5-mediated fragmentation and tagging of cDNA. Various cells treated with different concentrations of methanol were used to validate the efficacy of this method.

MOV10 facilitates messenger RNA decay in an N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent manner to maintain the mouse embryonic stem cells state,GSE181821,Mus musculus,N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most predominant internal mRNA modification in eukaryotes， recognised by its reader proteins (so-called m6A-readers) for regulating subsequent mRNA fates â splicing， export， localization， decay， stability and translation â to control several biological processes. Although a few m6A-readers have been identified， yet the list is incomplete. Here， we identify a new m6A-reader protein， MOV10， in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). MOV10 recognises m6A-containing mRNAs with a conserved GGm6ACU motif. Mechanistic studies uncover that MOV10 bound m6A-containing mRNAs facilitate mRNA decay within the cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies) in an m6A-dependent manner.  Moreover， MOV10 decays the Gsk-3Ã mRNA through m6A that stabilises the Ã-CATENIN expression of a Wnt/Ã-catenin signalling pathway to regulate downstream target expression of NANOG for maintaining the mESC state. Thus， our findings reveal how a newly identified m6A-reader， MOV10 mediates mRNA decay via m6A that impact ESC biology.,RNAseq， m6A-seq， RIPseq，  Riboseq between Wild-type and KO mouse ESCs,nan,
Dissecting the spatiotemporal diversity of adult neural stem cells,GSE246714,Danio rerio,Adult stem cells are important for tissue turnover and regeneration. However， in most adult systems it remains elusive how stem cells assume different functional states and support spatially patterned tissue architecture. Here， we dissected the diversity of neural stem cells in the adult zebrafish brain， an organ that is characterized by pronounced zonation and high regenerative capacity. We combined single-cell transcriptomics of dissected brain regions with massively parallel lineage tracing and in vivo RNA metabolic labeling to analyze regulation of neural stem cells in space and time. We detected a large diversity of neural stem cells， with some subtypes being restricted to a single brain region， while others were found globally across the brain. Global stem cell states are linked to neurogenic differentiation， with different states being involved in proliferative and non-proliferative differentiation. Our work reveals principles of adult stem cell organization and establishes a resource for functional manipulation of neural stem cell subtypes.,Single cell RNA-seq of adult zebrafish brain performed using 10x Genomics Gene Expression protocols to explore transcriptomic diversity of adult cell types. The samples were prepared either from whole brain， FACS-sorted cells (GFP positive cells from gfap:GFP line) or a dissected single brain region， as indicated in the sample title. CRISPR-based lineage tracing was performed for a subset of samples to dissect developmental lineage relationships between cells. ScSLAM-seq was performed in combination with Notch pathway inhibition to assess response of stem cells to perturbation.,38365956,Mol Syst Biol
Autocrine Sfrp1 inhibits lung fibroblast invasion during transition to injury induced myofibroblasts,GSE207561,Homo sapiens,Fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion is a major driver of tissue remodeling in organ fibrosis. Several distinct lineages of fibroblasts support homeostatic tissue niche functions， yet， specific activation states and phenotypic trajectories of fibroblasts during injury repair have remained unclear. Here， we combined spatial transcriptomics， longitudinal single-cell RNA-seq and genetic lineage tracing to study fibroblast fates during mouse lung regeneration. We discovered a transitional fibroblast state characterized by high Sfrp1 expression， derived from both Tcf21-Cre lineage positive and negative cells. Sfrp1+ cells appeared early after injury in peribronchiolar， adventitial and alveolar locations and preceded the emergence of myofibroblasts. We identified lineage specific paracrine signals and inferred converging transcriptional trajectories towards Sfrp1+ transitional fibroblasts and Cthrc1+ myofibroblasts. TgfÎ²1 downregulated Sfrp1 in non-invasive transitional cells and induced their switch to an invasive Cthrc1+ myofibroblast identity. Finally， using loss of function experiments we show that autocrine Sfrp1 directly inhibits fibroblast invasion by regulating the RhoA pathway. In summary， our study reveals the convergence of spatially and transcriptionally distinct fibroblast lineages into transcriptionally uniform myofibroblasts and identifies Sfrp1 as an autocrine inhibitor of fibroblast invasion during early stages of fibrogenesis.,We performed gene expression microarray analysis in primary human pulmonary fibroblasts treated with Sfrp1-siRNA and controls,38212077,Eur Respir J

ZFP281 coordinates DNMT3 and TET1 in pluripotent state transitions [RNA-seq],GSE226041,Mus musculus,The progression and transition between the naÃ¯ve， formative， and primed pluripotent states are accompanied by a sharp activation of the de novo DNA methyltransferases and the reorganization of transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes. Here we identified Zinc Finger Protein 281 (ZFP281) as an essential factor in the formative-to-primed pluripotent state transition. Using a knockout mouse model and a knockin degron cell system， we revealed that transcription of Dnmt3a/3b depends on the activity of ZFP281 in embryonic stem cells， epiblast-like cells， and epiblast stem cells. Mechanically， chromatin-bound ZFP281 and DNA hydroxylase TET1 are decreased in the formative state but recovered in the primed state to compete with DNMT3A/3B for establishing the DNA methylation and gene expression programs of primed pluripotency. In addition， chromatin occupancy of ZFP281 and TET1 depend on the R-loop structures formed at the ZFP281 target gene promoters devoid of DNA methylation. Our study demonstrates a comprehensive role of ZFP281 in modulating DNA methylation and demethylation for the establishment and maintenance of primed pluripotency.,RNA-seq of WT and Zfp281degron pluripotent stem cells,38237590,Dev Cell

IKKÎ² Inhibition Attenuates Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition of Human Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelium,GSE228934,Homo sapiens,Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)， which is well known for its role in embryonic development， malignant transformation， and tumor progression， has also been implicated in a variety of retinal diseases， including proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)， age-related macular degeneration (AMD)， and diabetic retinopathy. EMT of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)， although important in the pathogenesis of these retinal conditions， is not well understood at the molecular level. We and others have shown that a variety of molecules， including the co-treatment of human stem cell-derived RPE monolayer cultures with transforming growth factor beta (TGFâÎ²) and the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFâÎ±)， can induce RPEâEMT; however， small molecule inhibitors of RPEâEMT have been less well studied. Here， we demonstrate that BAY651942， a small molecule inhibitor of nuclear factor kapa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKÎ²) that selectively targets NF-ÎºB signaling， can modulate TGFâÎ²/TNFâÎ±-induced RPEâEMT. Next， we performed RNA-seq studies on BAY651942 treated hRPE monolayers to dissect altered biological pathways and signaling events. Further， we validated the effect of IKKÎ² inhibition on RPEâEMT-associated factors using a second IKKÎ² inhibitor， BMS345541， with RPE monolayers derived from an independent stem cell line. Our data highlights the fact that pharmacological inhibition of RPEâEMT restores RPE identity and may provide a promising approach for treating retinal diseases that involve RPE dedifferentiation and EMT.,We compared the transcriptomic profiles of human stem cell-derived RPE monolayer cultures co-treated with TGFâÎ²/TNFâÎ± and a small molecule (BAY651942) inhibitor of nuclear factor kapa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKÎ²),nan,
RUNX1-ETO and RUNX1-EVI-1 differentially program the chromatin landscape in t(3;21) and t(8;21) AML but share global C/EBP-alpha dysfunction (DNase-Seq),GSE87284,Homo sapiens,RUNX1 is a frequent target of translocations in acute myeloid leukemia whereby its DNA binding domain fuses to different epigenetic regulators. To assess how different RUNX1 fusion proteins interact with the epigenome we compared the global binding patterns and the chromatin landscape of t(8;21) and t(3;21) AML which express RUNX1-ETO and RUNX1-EVI-1， respectively. We found that differential prognosis for these types of AML is reflected in fundamental differences in gene expression， chromatin landscape， binding patterns of the fusion proteins and other transcription factors as identified by genome-wide digital footprinting in patients. As previously shown for RUNX1-ETO， knockdown of RUNX1-EVI-1 expression initiates differentiation of t(3;21) cells which is associated with up-regulation of genes vital for myeloid differentiation， including C/EBPÎ±. Furthermore， by expressing either dominant-negative C/EBP or an inducible C/EBPÎ± construct in t(3;21) cells we show that C/EBPÎ± is necessary and sufficient for the differentiation response of these cells to RUNX1-EVI-1 knockdown.,DNAse1-seq expreiments have been used to study the chromatin landscape of t(8;21) and t(3;21) AML,28538183,Cell Rep

Multifaceted SOX2-chromatin interaction underpins pluripotency progression in early embryos,GSE203194,Mus musculus,Pioneer transcription factors (TFs)， such as OCT4 and SOX2， play crucial roles in pluripotency regulation. However， the master TF-governed pluripotency regulatory circuitry was largely inferred from cultured cells. In this work， we investigated SOX2 binding from embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5) to E7.5 in the mouse. In E3.5 inner cell mass (ICM)， SOX2 regulates the ICM-trophectoderm program but is dispensable for opening global enhancers. Instead， SOX2 occupies preaccessible enhancers in part opened by early-stage expressing TFs TFAP2C and NR5A2. SOX2 then redistributes when cells adopt naive and formative pluripotency by opening enhancers or poising them for further rapid activation. Hence， multifaceted pioneer TFâenhancer interaction underpins pluripotency progression in embryos， including a state in E3.5 ICM that bridges totipotency and pluripotency.,By employing CUT&RUN，ATAC-seq， ChIP-seq and RNA-seq， we systematically examined the genome wide SOX2 cromatin binding an function in mouse erly embryos and  mESC cell lines and differentiated cells.,38096290,Science
Loss of Apela peptide in mice causes low penetrance embryonic lethality and defects in early mesodermal derivatives,GSE101748,Mus musculus,Apela (also referred to as Elabela， Ende and Toddler) is a small signaling peptide that activates the G protein-coupled receptor Aplnr. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a null， reporter-expressing allele， in order to study the role of Apela in the developing mouse embryo. We found that loss of Apela results in low penetrance cardiovascular defects that manifest after the onset of circulation. Targeted Apela null alleles exhibited different transcriptional activity depending on the presence or absence of a Neomycin selection cassette. These are referred to as Apela KO NEO-IN and Apela KO NEO-OUT strains， respectively. Despite subtle phenotypic characteristics that were unique to the NEO-OUT mutants， both Apela null strains shared the same variable expressivity of cardiovascular defects and the same penetrance of embryonic lethality. To investigate the earliest regulatory events leading to physical abnormalities in Apela mutants， we performed RNA-Seq on whole stage-matched and morphologically normal E7.5 embryos (3 wild-type， 6 Apela KO NEO-IN， and 6 Apela KO NEO-OUT individuals). We chose this stage because Apela is initially expressed in the embryo at late gastrulation， shortly after the emergence of extraembryonic mesoderm progenitors. Since modification of the Apela locus may influence the expression of neighboring genes， we examined the expression of upstream and downstream sequences and found no significant difference in their expression. Downregulated genes of interest included several mitochondrial genes， Ceacam2， Ulk4， and Mov10l1. Upregulated genes included the vascular endothelial growth factor Vegfc. Principal component analysis identified outliers (KO1 and KO9)， both of which expressed lower levels of mesoderm markers. KO9 was further characterized by aberrant upregulation of erythroid and myeloid markers. This finding was confirmed in our study by qRT-PCR analysis of additional Apela null individuals.,15 individual embryos were analyzed at E7.5. Embryos were stage-matched according to morphological landmarks. Control samples were wild-type (n=3)， and Apela KO samples were null embryos from the NEO-IN (n=6， âKO1-6â) and NEO-OUT (n=6， âKO7-12) mutant strains. Whole embryos (including embryonic and extraembryonic tissues) were used for the analysis. Apela KO samples were isolated from homozygous KO intercrosses and therefore did not require genotyping.,28854362,Cell Rep
Cellular atlas of the human ovary using morphologically guided spatial transciptomics and single-cell sequencing [scRNA-seq],GSE260685,Homo sapiens,The reproductive and endocrine functions of the human ovary involve spatially defined interactions among highly specialized cell populations. Despite the importance of the ovary in female fertility and overall endocrine health， the functional attributes of ovarian cells and the complex structures in which they reside are largely uncharacterized， limiting our understanding of the key mechanisms of follicle development such as steroid hormone production and somatic-germ cells interactions. In this study we profiled the expression of >18，000 protein genes in 257 spatially defined human ovary samples to examine major types of functional units in the ovary， including areas enriched for oocytes， theca cells， and granulosa cells. To complement the spatial data， we generated single-cell RNA sequencing data for 21，198 past-QC cells from three additional donors and identified four major cell types and four immune cell subtypes. Custom selection of sampling areas and antibody-guided targeting of known cell types led to transcriptional profiles that are spatially highly specific， revealing distinct gene activities for early-stage oocytes and for theca and granulosa cells， respectively， all collected from their native tissue sites. These data significantly expanded the knowledge of molecular programs driving follicle development， contributing to a panel of 76 oocyte-specific genes including novel markers PADI6， UCHL1， ZFAND2A， and REC114， and similarly a 96- and 45-gene panel for granulosa and theca cells， respectively. Serial samples in follicle rings and across consecutive layers of the cortex and medulla uncovered spatial gradients in antral follicles and in the cortex surface， as well as previously unappreciated diversity of local gene expression patterns， reflecting regional variations of hormone signaling (NR4A1， CEBPD， STAR， and ADAMTS4) and extracellular matrix remodeling (VIM， COL1/8/12/14/16/18， and TIMP1/2). The combined spatial and single-cell human ovary atlas reported here serves as a resource for developing next-generation reagents for cell enrichment， high-resolution imaging， lineage analysis， and perturbation.,Two healthy donors sequenced using nanoString GeoMx and three healthy donors sequenced using 10x Chromium,nan,
sc-RNA sequencing data of primary liver cells from wildtype， YAPKO，TAZKO and DKO mice,GSE234260,Mus musculus,Background & AimsThe Hippo pathway and its transcriptional effectors yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are promising targets for cancer therapy. However， it is not understood if inhibition of one factor is compensated by the activation of the other and if YAP/TAZ-directed perturbation affects cell-cell communication of non-malignant liver-resident cells.MethodsMice with hepatocyte (HC)-/biliary epithelial cell (BEC)-specific deletions of YAP and/or TAZ were generated (YAPKO， TAZKO and double knock-out (DKO)). Liver tissues were investigated by histology， immunohistochemistry， and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Serum samples were analyzed using a cytokine array.ResultsLiver tissues from YAPKO and DKO mice were characterized by the loss of BECs， liver fibrosis， and necrosis. This phenotype was weakened in DKO tissues compared to specimen from YAPKO animals. YAP expression was induced in different non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) after YAP-depletion in HCs and BECs. Activation of YAP in Kupffer cells (KCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in subclusters with specific molecular features was independent of cholestasis. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) were detected in the serum of YAPKO animals. YAP-interacting TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) family members bound promoter regions of different secreted factors and may contribute to a severe inflammatory response in mice with YAP-inactivation in HCs and BECs.ConclusionsYAP inactivation causes severe liver damage in vivo and concomitant TAZ deletion does not enhance but moderately reduce this phenotype. Furthermore， we describe a new mechanism how YAP inactivation in HCs/BECs contributes to YAP-driven heterologous cell communication originating from NPCs.,sc-RNA sequencing data were generared from primary liver cells of  wildtype (n=1)， YAPKO(n=1)，TAZKO(n=1) and DKO (n=1) mice,38436764,Cell Mol Life Sci
Epistasis between TIFAB and miR-146a， neighboring genes in del(5q) MDS,GSE87453,Mus musculus,Interstitial deletion of a single copy of chromosome 5q is the most frequent cytogenetic alteration in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)， which results in reduced dosage of numerous genes. Furthermore， the extent of the 5q deletion determines disease severity， suggesting cooperation between deleted genes in the proximal and distal regions of del(5q). Although the contribution of individual genes to the pathogenesis of del(5q) MDS has been investigated， less is known about the epistatic interactions and/or cooperation between neighboring deleted genes. Deletion of TRAF-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain B (TIFAB) and miR-146a， two haploinsufficient genes in del(5q) MDS， has been previously reported to activate the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cascade in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) by increasing TRAF6 protein stability and mRNA translation， respectively. To investigate the epistasis of TIFAB and miR-146a， we generated a mouse model in which Tifab and miR-146a were simultaneously deleted (Tifab-/-;miR-146a-/-， dKO). Herein， we report that combined hematopoietic-specific deletion of Tifab and miR-146a results in more rapid and severe cytopenia， and progression to a fatal bone marrow (BM) failure-like disease as compared to Tifab- or miR-146adeficiency alone. HSPC from Tifab-/-， miR-146a-/-， and dKO mice exhibit enrichment of gene 69 regulatory networks associated with innate immune signaling. Moreover， a subset of the differentially expressed genes is controlled synergistically following deletion of Tifab and miR-146a. Notably， nearly half of these defined synergy response genes identified in the mouse models were aberrantly expressed in del(5q) MDS HSPC when TIFAB (5q31) and miR-146a (5q33.3) were both deleted. Thus， synergistic control of gene expression following deletion of epistatic haploinsufficient genes in del(5q) MDS may be an underlying mechanism of the diseased state.,To determine whether combined deletion of Tifab and miR-146a exaggerates the hematopoietic-specific defects observed in either Tifab- or miR-146a-deficient mice in vivo， bone marrow (BM) cells from WT， Tifab-/-， miR-146a-/-， and dKO mice were transplanted into lethally-irradiated syngeneic recipient mice. All recipient mice efficiently engrafted donor BM cells. To gain insight into the molecular nature and collaborative interplay between TIFAB and miR-146a deficiencies responsible for the exaggerated hematopoietic defect associated with MDS， we examined the gene regulatory networks in HSPC from mice transplanted with WT， Tifab-/-， miR- 146a-/-， and dKO BM. The lineage-Sca-1-c-kit+ (LK) BM fractions were analyzed using whole-genome RNA sequencing. Total RNA was amplified using the Ovation RNA-Seq System v2 (NuGEN) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. The libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Technologies). 1 ng of cDNA was suspended in Tagment DNA Buffer， and tagmentation (fragmentation and tagging with the adaptors) was performed with the Nextera enzyme (Amplicon Tagment Mix)， incubating at 55C for 10 min. NT Buffer was then added to neutralize the samples. Libraries were prepared by PCR with the Nextera PCR Master Mix， and 2 Nextera Indexes (N7XX， and N5XX) according to the following program: one cycle of 72C for 3min， one cycle of 98C for 30s， 12 cycles of 95C for 10s， 55C for 30s， and 72C for 1min， and one cycle of 72C for 5min. The purified cDNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 following the manufacturer's protocol,27733775,Leukemia

Accurate long-read transcript discovery and quantification at single-cell resolution with Isosceles [scRNA-seq],GSE248115,Homo sapiens,Accurate detection and quantification of mRNA isoforms from nanopore long-read sequencing remains challenged by technical noise， particularly in single cells. To address this， we introduce Isosceles， a computational toolkit that outperforms other methods in isoform detection sensitivity and quantification accuracy across single-cell， pseudo-bulk and bulk resolution levels， as demonstrated using synthetic and biologically-derived datasets. Isosceles improves the fidelity of single-cell transcriptome quantification at the isoform-level， and enables flexible downstream analysis.  As a case study， we apply Isosceles， uncovering coordinated splicing within and between neuronal differentiation lineages.  Isosceles is suitable to be applied in diverse biological systems， facilitating studies of cellular heterogeneity across biomedical research applications.,scRNA-seq sequencing of a mix of three ovarian cancer cell lines using PromethION and Illumina platforms used for benchmarking the Isosceles package.,39183289,Nat Commun

Differential Gene Expression of Field Pea Genotypes After Peyronellaea pinodes infection,GSE222997,Pisum sativum,Ascochyta blight (AB) is a devastating and aggressive disease of field peas caused by multiple pathogens and the occurrence of the combinations of these pathogens forms a disease complex of which Peyronellaea pinodes， is the most aggressive. AB symptoms include necrotic lesions on all above ground parts of the plant， which can reduce crop yield by up to 70% and result in major economic losses globally. Crop resistance to the disease is reported to be quantitative and， although several genes have been reported to be AB response genes in Spanish pea genotypes， the lines or genotypes of the Australian field pea breeding program have not been investigated.Plants have specialized defence mechanisms that enable them respond to pathogen invasion， and this involves a cascade of genes which are differentially regulated upon infection. In this study， the time-course gene expression profiles of four Australian field pea genotypes including commercial varieties， known to have varying levels of AB resistance were investigated in response to P. pinodes infection.  Infected and control plants at 0， 6， 24， 48， 72 and 96HPI were sampled for RNA seq.  Mapping of transcriptome sequencing data against the field pea genome resulted in about the identification of c. 6，700 differentially expressed genes. Of the 21 AB resistance genes reported in previously published studies， only seven were present on the list of DEGs generated in this study. No significant pattern was identified in gene expression for the seven genes to differentiate resistant from susceptible genotypes. However， four key genes i.e.， disease response protein， malate dehydrogenase， isoflavone 2 hydrogenase and Isoflavone reductase were shown to be associated with suppression of AB disease phenotype after 96HPI. Furthermore， GO functional annotation revealed several genes associated with defence including genes associated with the Salicylic acid pathway， reactive oxygen species， programmed cell death and hypersensitive response.Although the overall result showed a lack of strong resistance in the Australian pea genotypes as well as the fact that disease suppression does not directly equal resistance， we however were able to identify potential candidates that could be pyramided from exotic material into the breeding program to assess for improved resistance.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for field pea genotypes (11HP302-12HO-1， PBA WHARTON， PBA TWILIGHT， and OZP1604) at 0hpi， 6hpi， 48hpi， 72hpi and 96hpi (hours post infection),nan,
Next Generation Sequencing and Quantitative Analysis of mRNAs in Wild-Type Caenorhabditis elegans Animals Consuming Kombucha Tea-assocaited Microbes,GSE236037,Caenorhabditis elegans,Kombucha Tea (KT)， a fermented tea with roots in traditional Chinese medicine， has surged in worldwide popularity due to its purported health benefits. KT contains a symbiotic culture of yeast and bacterial species， many of which are considered human probiotics. The molecular basis of the health benefits of KT has yet to be thoroughly explored in any animal model. We establishC. elegansas a model to query the molecular interactions between Kombucha-associated microbes (KTM) and the host. We find that worms have an established gut microbiome after consuming a KTM-exclusive diet that mirrors the microbial community found in the fermenting culture. Remarkably， animals consuming KTMs display strikingly reduced lipid levels， yet develop and reproduce similarly toE. coli-fed animals. Critically， consumption of a non-fermenting mix of KT microbial isolates (Kombucha microbe mix) resulted in elevated fat accumulation， suggesting that KTMs do not impair nutrient absorption. To identify the host metabolic pathways altered by KTMs， we performed mRNA-seq on KTM-fed animals， finding widespread changes in lipid metabolism genes. Specifically， we found that three lysosomal lipase genes are significantly upregulated in these animals. These lipases， LIPL-1-3， have been previously shown to promote lipophagy via catabolism of lipid droplets. Consistently， KTM-fed animals display reduced levels of triglycerides and smaller lipid droplet sizes. We propose that KTM-fed animals exhibit a fasting-like metabolic state， even in the presence of sufficient nutrient availability， possibly through induction of lipophagy. Elucidating the host metabolic response to KT consumption will provide unprecedented insight into how this popular fermented beverage may impact human health and inform its use in complementary healthcare plans.,The mRNAs of wild-type day 1 adult animals reared on E. coli， Acetobacter tropicalis， or Kombucha-associated microbes were profiled by high-throughput sequencing， in triplicate.,38547054,PLoS Genet
Oncogene-dependent regulation of tumor cells via stromal reciprocal signalling,GSE70351,Mus musculus,Cancer is a heterocellular disease composed of tumor cells and stromal cells. Although stromal cells are known to regulate cancer progression， oncogene-dependent signalling through heterocellular cancer systems remains poorly elucidated. Here， we describe KRASG12D-dependent âreciprocalâ signalling across tumor and stromal Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. Heterocellular multivariate phosphoproteomics demonstrates how an oncogenic cue (KRASG12D)， a trans-cellular signal (SHH)， and stromal cells drive a reciprocal response in tumor cells. KRASG12D-dependent reciprocal signalling regulates the tumor cell phosphoproteome， total proteome， and mitochondria activity via an IGFR1/AXL-AKT axis. The reciprocal KRASG12D signalling state requires a heterocellular context and is unreachable by cell-autonomous oncogenic KRAS alone. These findings provide evidence that oncogenic KRAS regulates tumor cells via heterocellular reciprocation.,Comparison between FACS resolved iKRAS cells (previously in co-culture with PSCs) pertubed with a SHH antibody,nan,
Transcriptional reprogramming of neural stem cells by a PHF6/EphR signalling pathway [ChIP-Seq],GSE247836,Mus musculus,The plant homeodomain zinc finger protein，PHF6， is a transcriptional regulator， with its germline mutations causing the X-linked intellectual disability (XLID)， BoÌrjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS).The precise mechanisms by whichPHF6regulates transcription and how its mutant forms lead to XLID remain poorly characterized. Here， we show genome-wide binding of PHF6 in the developing cortex， most of which overlap (CA)n-microsatellite repeats near genes involved in central nervous system development and neurogenesis. Mice harbouring BFLS patient mutations exhibit defects in neurogenesis and altered neural stem cell fate. Mechanistically， we find that PHF6 regulatesa panel of Ephrin receptors (EphRs)and that PHF6regulation ofEphRis impaired in BFLS mice and ina conditionalPhf6knock-out mouse model. We report that mice harboring BFLS mutations exhibit an increase in embryonic neural stem cell (eNSC) self-renewal， a significant attenuation of newly born neurons， and thatEphRknockdown phenocopies the PHF6 loss-of-function defects in altering eNSC fate. Our results suggest that alterations in eNSC fate specification via a PHF6/EphRtranscriptional pathway leads to impaired neurogenesis in BFLS,Here， we show genome-wide binding of PHF6 in the developing cortex.ChIP-seq data were processed as previously described (Hernandez-Corchado & Najafabadi， 2022). Briefly， raw reads were aligned to the mouse genome assembly version mm10 with bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1) using the â--very-sensitive-localâ mode. Duplicate reads were removed using samtools (version 1.9) (Danecek et al.， 2021). ChIP-seq peaks were identified using MACS (version 1.4) (Feng， Liu， Qin， Zhang， & Liu， 2012; Zhang et al.， 2008) with a permissive p-value threshold of 0.001， using â--nomodelâ option. Fragment size was specified using â--shiftsizeâ argument， with the fragment length obtained by cross-correlation analysis using phantompeakqualtools (Landt et al.， 2012). Peak-TSS distances were calculated using bedtools (Quinlan & Hall， 2010) only for peaks that passed p-value threshold of 10â5， with TSS coordinates obtained from GENCODE (Frankish et al.， 2019) (release M9).,38429579,EMBO Rep
cis regulated role of lncRNA in transcriptional or developmental process (ChIRP-Seq),GSE79541,Mus musculus,We report that long noncoding RNAs contribute to transcription and developmental process. Thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in the whole genome， and tend to located closely to protein-coding genes. To study position relationship between lncRNA and protein-coding genes， we classified all of lncRNA to several subgroups based on the genome position with their coding neighbors. XH， the head to head subgroup is associated with transcription and development in GO analysis. Here， we knockdown serveral XH lncRNA by shRNA in embryonic stem cells and induce nondirectional differnetiation by removing LIF or neural differnetiation by RA. Knockdown of XH lncRNAs led to uniform downregulation of nearby coding genes， and form regulatory circuits with its nearby coding genes to fine-tune embryonic lineage development. In addition， we also knockout one lncRNA-Evx1as and its nearby protein-coding gene-EVX1 by CRISPR， and get similar results as knockdown.We propose that XH lncRNA may function primarily as 'cis-regulators' of the expression of nearby protein-coding genes， and tend to participate in transcriptional or development regulations as their coding neighbors.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal the differentially expressed genes between wild-type and XH lncRNA knockdown/knockout ESCs during differentiation.,26996597,Cell Stem Cell

High-throughput mapping of single-neuron projection and molecular features by retrograde barcoded labelling [bulk RNA-seq],GSE210173,Mus musculus,Deciphering patterns of connectivity between neurons in the mammalian brain is a critical step toward understanding brain function. Conventional imaging based neuroanatomical tracing methods identify area-to-area or sparse neuron-to-neuron connectivity patterns， but with extremely limited throughput. Recently developed barcode-based connectomics methods can efficiently map large numbers of single-neuron projections， but linking these data to single-cell transcriptomics remains a challenge. Here， we established a retro-AAV barcode-based multiplexed tracing method called MERGE-seq (Multiplexed projection neuRons retroGrade barcodE sequencing)， which is capable of simultaneously characterizing the projectome and transcriptome at the single neuron level. We uncovered dedicated and collateral projection patterns of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) neurons to five downstream targets (AI， DMS， BLA， MD and LH). We found that projection-defined vmPFC neurons are molecularly heterogeneous， which are composed of different neuronal subtypes. We further identified transcriptional signatures of various dedicated and bifurcated vmPFC neurons， and verified Pou3f1 as the marker gene of neurons sending collateral axons to DMS and LH. Finally， we fitted our single-neuron connectome/transcriptome data into a machine learning-based model and revealed groups of genes that were predictive of certain projection pattern. In summary， we have developed a new multiplexed technique whose paired connectome and gene expression data can help reveal organizational principles that form neural circuits and process information.,Male adult C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks of age) were anesthetized intraperitoneally using pentobarbital sodium (10 mg/mL， 120 mg/kg b.w.) and unilaterally injected with rAAV-EGFP-BARCODE virus into five projection targets simultaneously.  Barcode 0 sequences representing the AI target is: CTGCACCGACGCATT; barcode 1 sequences representing the DMS target is: GAAGGCACAGACTTT; barcode 2 sequences representing the MD target is: GTTGGCTGCAATCCA; barcode 3 sequences representing the BLA target is: AAGACGCCGTCGCAA; barcode 4 sequences representing the LH target is: TATTCGGAGGACGAC.  3 mice were performed scRNA-seq without FAC-sorting， cell pellets were resuspended and 48，000 cells were loaded into 3 lanes to perform 10X Genomics sequencingperformed scRNA. 3 mice with sorting and pooled together for scRNA-seq. Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits (v3) were used for transcriptome library preparation (10X Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 system.  Parallel PCR reactions were performed containing 50 ng of post cDNA amplification reaction cleanup material as a template. P5-Read1 (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTC) and P7-index-Read2-EGFP (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATAGGATTCGGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGgCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAG) (200 nM each) were used as primers with the NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (NEB， Cat #M0544L).

Alternate high fat diet aggravates atherosclerosis through an IL1b-dependent reprogramming of neutrophil progenitors,GSE252604,Mus musculus,Systemic immune responses induced by chronic hypercholesterolemia contribute to the initiation， progression and complications of atherosclerosis. However， the consequences of an alternate high fat diet and the associated variations in plasma cholesterol levels on atherosclerosis are unknown. To address this relevant issue concerning common situations where dietary habits change over time， we developed a novel protocol in athero-prone mice that allowed us to compare the effects of alternate versus continuous high fat diet (HFD) on atherosclerosis， the overall period of time of exposure to HFD being similar between groups. We showed that alternate HFD lead to accelerated atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/-  and Apoe-/- mice compared to continuous HFD. The pro-atherogenic effect of alternate HFD was also found in Apoe-/-Rag2-/- mice lacking T， B， and NKT cells， ruling out a role for the adaptive immune system in the observed phenotype. Using different complementary in vivo approaches， we found that lipid-rich diet discontinuation in alternate group downregulated Runx1， a negative regulator downstream of TLR-4 pathways. As a result， after re-exposure to HFD， myeloid progenitors were more sensitive to hypercholesterolemia leading to acute differentiation into IL-1b- producing immature neutrophils， which caused a state of emergency myelopoiesis. Consecutively， neutrophils markedly increased in the peripheral blood， infiltrated atherosclerotic lesions and locally released neutrophil extracellular traps. Anti-Ly6G neutrophil depletion abolished the pro-atherogenic effects of alternate HFD. Specific deletion of Il1b and Il1b receptor confirmed that the IL-1b signaling pathway was a major driver of the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic neutrophil signature. Finally， treatment with anti-IL-1b neutralizing antibody or inflammasome inhibitor during re-exposure to HFD reversed the pro-atherogenic effects of alternate HFD. In summary， we showed that alternate HFD accelerates atherosclerosis through IL-1b-dependent neutrophil progenitor reprogramming.,Lin- cells from femur bones of HFD exposed and non-exposed Ldlr-/- mice were dissected and single cell RNA Seq libraries were prepared with ParseBio Evercode WT Mega v2 kit.,nan,
Immuno-Oncologic Profiling by Stage-Dependent Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses of Spontaneously Regressing Canine Cutaneous Histiocytoma,GSE261387,Canis lupus familiaris,Canine cutaneous histiocytoma (CCH) is a tumor originating from dermal Langerhans cells， especially affecting young dogs. The common spontaneous regression of CCH makes it an interesting model in comparative oncology research. Previous studies have indicated that anti-tumor immune responses may be involved but details remain speculative to date. Here， we asked which specific immuno-oncological dynamics underlie spontaneous regression of CCH on mRNA and protein levels. QuantSeq 3' mRNA sequencing with functional overrepresentation analysis and an nCounter RNA hybridization assay were employed on 21 formalin-fixed， paraffin-embedded CCH samples representing three different tumor stages. Nine additional samples were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Surprisingly， only minor stage-specific differences were found. When we investigated expression of B7 family ligands and CD28 family receptors holding co-stimulatory and -inhibitory functions respectively， we found higher abundance of CD80， CD86 and CD28， which trigger activation of lymphocyte-mediated immune responses. CD80 and CD86 expressing cells were further quantified by in situ hybridization and compared with data from three cases of canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS)， a malignant tumor variant originating from antigen presenting cells. A stage-specific increase of CD80 expression was recorded in CCH from the tumor bottom to the top， while CD86 was continuously and homogenously expressed at high levels. Expression of CD80 in CCH was similar to that in HS (73.3 Â± 37.4% versus 62.1 Â± 46.4% positive cells)， while CD86 was significantly higher expressed in CCH (94.7 Â± 10.3%) when compared to HS (57.6 Â± 11.0%). Our data suggest that major immuno-oncological pathways are seemingly not regulated during regression of CCH on the mRNA or protein levels as detectable by the methods used. We speculate that key signals leading to tumor regression may occur at an interactome level or at an earlier time point than examined here. Our data further supports a role of immune stimulatory B7 family ligands and CD28 family receptors in CCH regression.,To investigate stage-dependant differences of canine coutaneous histiocytoma (CCH) at the transcriptome level， RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffine-embedded (FFPE) material. Afterwards gene expression profiling was performed using RNA-Seq data from 4 different groups. Tumor-cell enriched groups (2a vs. 1) and lymphocyte-enriched groups (3 vs. 2b) were compared.,nan,

The Diversified Astrocyte Developmental Programs are Modulated by Primary Ciliary Signaling,GSE253643,Mus musculus,This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Astrocyte diversity is greatly influenced by local environmental modulation. In this study， we analyzed how primary ciliary signaling modulates astrocyte subtype-specific maturation and accessed the impact of ciliary deficient astrocytes on neuronal programs and behaviours. Comparative single-cell transcriptomics revealed that primary cilia mediate canonical Shh signaling to modulate astrocyte subtype-specific core features in synaptic regulation， intracellular transport， energy， and metabolism. Independent of canonical Shh signaling， primary cilia are important regulators for astrocyte morphology and intracellular signaling balance. Dendritic spine analysis and transcriptomics revealed that perturbation of astrocytic cilia leads to disruption of neuronal development and global intercellular connectomes in the brain. Our results uncover a critical role for primary cilia in transmitting local cues that drive the region-specific diversification of astrocytes within the developing brain,39103557,Nat Neurosci
A Unified Framework for Systematic Identification of Post-Transcriptional Regulatory Modules [ATAC-Seq],GSE225806,Homo sapiens,RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are multifunctional regulators of gene expression with complex and context-dependent mechanisms of action， yet the regulatory grammar that underlies RBP-mediated functions remains underexplored. Here， we performed a multi-omic data integration to systematically decipher the context-specific functions of RBPs. First， we report a compendium of in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) datasets of 50 human RBPs， which we used to generate a large-scale map of RBP protein neighborhoods. In parallel， we took advantage of CRISPR-interference with single-cell RNA-seq read-out (Perturb-seq) to capture rich transcriptomic phenotypes downstream of each RBP knockdown. By combining these physical and functional interaction readouts， along with the ENCODE transcriptome-wide atlas of RBP binding sites from eCLIP assays， we generated an integrated map of functional RBP interactions. This map not only captures well-studied post-transcriptional processes， but also reveals numerous previously unknown RBP-mediated regulatory functions. For a number of these cases， we have validated their predicted context-specific RBP functions using biochemical and genetic approaches. By deciphering these complex modes of functional interactions between RBPs， we have taken the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory processes and their underlying molecular grammar.,Ribosomal profiling of K562 TAF15 KD cells,nan,
Non-linear transcriptional responses to gradual modulation of transcription factor dosage,GSE257547,Homo sapiens,Genomic loci associated with common traits and diseases are typically non-coding and likely impact gene expression， sometimes coinciding with rare loss-of-function variants in the target gene. However， our understanding of how gradual changes in gene dosage affect molecular， cellular， and organismal traits is currently limited. To address this gap， we induced gradual changes in gene expression of four genes using CRISPR activation and inactivation. Downstream transcriptional consequences of dosage modulation of three master trans-regulators associated with blood cell traits (GFI1B， NFE2， and MYB) was examined using targeted single-cell multimodal sequencing. We showed that guide tiling around the TSS is the most effective way to modulate cis gene expression across a wide range of fold-changes， with further effects from chromatin accessibility and histone marks that differ between the inhibition and activation systems. Our single-cell data allowed us to precisely detect subtle to large gene expression changes in dozens of trans genes， revealing that many responses to dosage changes of these three TFs are non-linear， including non-monotonic behaviours， even when constraining the fold-changes of the master regulators to a copy number gain or loss. We found that the dosage properties are linked to gene constraint and that some of these non-linear responses are enriched for disease and GWAS genes. Overall， our study provides a straightforward and scalable method to precisely modulate gene expression and gain insights into its downstream consequences at high resolution.,ECCITE-seq experiments obtaining three different modalities from a single cell: Protein Hashes (HTO) to identify CRISPRi or CRISPRa cell line of origin， cDNA as measurement of RNA levels and sgRNAs (GDO) to ienditfy the unique loci perturbation,38464330,bioRxiv
Single cell multi-omics analysis of chronic myeloid leukemia links cellular heterogeneity to therapy response,GSE236233,Homo sapiens,The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a paradigm in molecularly targeted cancer therapy. Nonetheless， TKI insensitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) persist in most patients， even after years of treatment. Here， we used cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) to generate high-resolution single cell multiomics maps from CML patients stratified according to molecular response (BCR-ABL IS %) following 12 months of TKI therapy. Simultaneous measurement of global gene expression profiles together with >40 surface markers from the same cells revealed that each patient harbored a unique composition of stem and progenitor cells at diagnosis demonstrating that cellular heterogeneity is a hallmark of CML. The patients with treatment failure at 12 months of therapy had markedly higher abundance of molecularly defined primitive cells at diagnosis compared to the optimal responders. The multi-modal feature landscape enabled visualization of the primitive fraction as a mix of Lin-CD34+38-/low BCR-ABL1+ LSCs and BCR-ABL1- HSCs in variable ratio across patients and guided their prospective isolation by a combination of CD26 and CD35 cell surface markers.,We performed CITE-seq on two FACS sorted cell populations (Lin-CD34+， Lin-CD34+CD38-) from nine CML bone marrow samples from patients with chronic phase CML at diagnosis.NOTE FROM SUBMITTER: The data comes from living human subjects which is why we cannot provide the raw sequences.

Rare cell variability and drug-induced reprogramming as a mode of cancer drug resistance [RNA-seq],GSE97679,Homo sapiens,Therapies targeting signaling molecules mutated in cancers can often have striking short-term effects， but the emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full cures. Resistance can sometimes result from a secondary mutations in rare cells， but other times， there is no clear genetic cause， raising leaving the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here， we show that melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces an epigenetic reprogramming in these cells， converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a progressive process consisting of a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signaling pathways， partially mediated by activity of Jun-AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression of many of these same marker genes， suggesting the existence of a general rare-cell expression program.,We performed FACS to isolate EGFR-high populations of WM989 melanoma cells at three time points (untreated， 1 week in vemurafenib， 4 weeks in vemurafenib) for RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing. Each sample has three biological replicates.,28607484,Nature
RoCK and ROI: a single-cell RNA-sequencing method with enhanced transcriptome information via targeted enrichment of transcripts and preselected， region-specific sequencing  II,GSE266117,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Many scRNAseq-based methods suffer from a high number of non-detects and a bias towards the 3' or 5' end of transcripts. We developed a method termed RoCK and ROI to address these two biases. RoCK and ROI leads to the enrichment of the transcriptome profile of cells with information on transcripts of interest,RoCK and ROI is based on barcoded beads of the BD Rhapsody platform. For RoCKseq specific capture， TSO oligos on BD Rhapsody beads are modified with a/ multiple capture sequence(s) specific to transcripts of interest. ROIseq， on the other hand， is based on specific primers which are spiked in during library generation， directing reads to regions of interest (ROIs). Multiple scRNAseq experiments were performed on several biological samples to validate RoCK and ROI. To validate RoCK and ROI library generation， scRNAseq experiments were performed on a mix of murine and human cell lines expressing eGFP or tdTomato respectively. As a further validation of RoCK and ROI， epithelial and mesenchymal cells from a transgenic mouse strain (B6.129S4-Pdgfratm11(EGFP)Sor/J) were used.,nan,
DNA Polymerase Delta Governs Parental Histone Transfer to DNA Replication Lagging Strand,GSE252049,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Chromatin replication is intricately intertwined with DNA replication， and the recycling of parental histones is essential for epigenetic inheritance. The transfer of parental histones to both the DNA replication leading and lagging strands involves two distinct pathways: the leading strand utilizes DNA polymerase Îµ subunits Dpb3/Dpb4， while the lagging strand is facilitated by the MCM helicase subunit Mcm2. However， the process by which Mcm2， moving along the leading strand， facilitates the transfer of parental histones to the lagging strand remains unclear. Our study reveals that the deletion of Pol32， a non-essential subunit of major lagging-strand DNA polymerase Î´， results in a predominant transfer of parental histone H3-H4 to the replication leading strand. Biochemical analyses further demonstrate that Pol32 can bind histone H3-H4 both in vivo and in vitro. The interaction of Pol32 with parental histone H3-H4 is disrupted by the mutation of Mcm2's histone H3-H4 binding domain. In conclusion， our findings identify the DNA polymerase delta subunit Pol32 as a novel key histone chaperone downstream of Mcm2， mediating the transfer of parental histones to the lagging strand during DNA replication.,We performed eSPAN according to the protocol in our previous studies with some modifications. Briefly， yeast cells were synchronized with alpha-factor and released in YPD medium with BrdU (400ug/ml) following the standard protocol. The cells were digested with MNase (NEB， Cat# M0247S)， after saving 1% for BrdU-IP， the rest of digested chromatin was subjected to ChIP against H3K4me3 (ab8580)， H3K56ac， HA-Tag (BETHYL，Cat#12CA5)， or T7-Tag (BETHYL，Cat#A190-117A)， individually. Then DNA extracted from the ChIP products was end-repaired and ligated with adapters using the VAHTSÂ® Universal DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina V3 (Vazyme， Cat#ND607). After saving 1% for ChIP-seq analysis， the products was subjected to BrdU-IP as previous reported， and the products was amplified with NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB， Cat# M0541L) and indexing primers. The obtained libraries were sequenced using the paired-end method by Illumina nova 6000.,nan,
RYBP coordinates with Trithorax complex and selectively recruits Polycomb complex for cell fate control,GSE261485,Mus musculus,The selective expression is pivotal in orchestrating human development， with the Trithorax Group (TrxG) and Polycomb Group (PcG) complexes playing crucial roles in transcriptional activation and repression， respectively. However， mechanism underlying selective regulation of transcription by TrxG and PcG remains poorly understood. In this study， RYBP was observed to interact with TrxG and PcG components. RYBP and TrxG co-localized loci selectively enriches RING1B. STAT3 enriches at RYBP-TrxG co-localized loci devoid of RING1B， while displaying minimal enrichment at RING1B-enrichred loci. Introduction of STAT3 at RYBP loci disrupted RING1B aggregation and chromatin binding. RYBP-deficiency impairs TrxG deposition at DNA repair genes in RYBP-TrxG loci， consequently diminishing their expression and inducing DNA damage. These results facilitate the transition of embryonic stem cells to 2-cell-like cells. Additionally， RYBP-deficiency attenuates PcG deposition at lineage-specific genes within RYBP-TrxG-RING1B loci， thereby promoting ESC differentiation. Collectively， these results provide novel insights into the selective regulation of gene expression.,RYBP KO for ChIP seq and RNA-seq,39604829,Mol Med
Comprehensive benchmarking of single cell RNA sequencing technologies for characterizing cellular perturbation systems,GSE161975,Homo sapiens,Technological advances in transcriptome sequencing of single cells provided an unprecedented view on tissue composition and cellular heterogeneity. While several studies have compared different single cell RNA-seq methods with respect to data quality and their ability to distinguish cellular  subpopulations， none of these comparative studies investigated the heterogeneity of the cellular transcriptional response upon a chemical perturbation. In this study， we evaluated the transcriptional response of NGP neuroblastoma cells upon nutlin-3 treatment using the C1， ddSeq and Chromium single cell systems. These systems and library preparation methods are representative for the wide variety of platforms， ranging from microfluids chips to droplet-based systems and from full transcript sequencing to 3â end sequencing. In parallel， we used bulk RNA-seq for molecular characterization of the transcriptional response. Two complementary metrics to evaluate performance were applied: the first is the number and identification of differentially expressed genes as robustly assessed by two statistical models， and the second is enrichment analysis of biological signals， which is independent of sample size or number of cells evaluated. Where relevant， we downsampled sequencing library size， selected cell subpopulations based on specific RNA abundance features， or created pseudobulk samples to make the data more comparable. While the C1 detects the highest number of genes per cell and better resembles bulk RNA-seq， the Chromium identifies most differentially expressed genes， albeit still substantially fewer than bulk RNA-seq. Gene set enrichment analyses reveals that detection of the most abundant genes in single cell RNA-seq experiments is sufficient for molecular phenotyping. Finally， single cell RNA-seq reveals a heterogeneous response of NGP cells upon nutlin-3 treatment， pinpointing putative late-responders or resistant cells， hidden in bulk RNA-seq experiments.,Samples were synchronized using serum starvation followed by treatment with Nutlin-3 or ethanol for 24 hours. Single cell RNA-seq was performed using the ddseq device.,nan,
Reconstructing regulative progenitor behaviors in synthetic embryos,GSE220949,Mus musculus;synthetic construct,Advanced stem cell-based in vitro models of embryogenesis offer great promise to decipher developmental programs with high-throughput and resolution. However， the rapid changes in morphology and cell state that underly these models mask multiple higher order parameters， including the regulative balance between differentiation and self-renewal that govern transient progenitor cell populations. Here， we apply a continuous single-cell Cas9-based molecular recorder to mouse embryonic stem cells， which enables the recovery of can reproducibly recovere and high-content information regarding the historical relationship between individual cells. We apply our system to Trunk-Like Structures (TLS)， a complex in vitro model of embryogenesis that captures differentiation and morphological dynamics from pluripotency exit to the specification of the somitic and neural lineages. By recording cell lineages alongside the transcriptional identities of extant cells， we are able to build high-resolution phylogenetic trees， identify clonal subpopulations， and reveal recover the step-wisestepwise series of events that govern germ layer specification. Moreover， we  examine are able to functionally characterize the specification and maintenance of multipotent neuro-mesodermal progenitor (NMP) populations as they coordinate self-renewal and commitment into more specialized cell types， including how thehow  highly disparateplastic individual  nature of individual branches trajectories ultimately aggregateultimately aggregate to ensure to generate the generation of highly consistent embryonic structures. Finally， we demonstrate the potential of this technology for high-throughput perturbation screening by combining small molecule treatment with individual structure labeling， allowing us to we demonstrate that these parameters can be independently tuned to modulate TLS morphology， including in reversible ways that extend the duration through which NMPs can contribute to both lineages of the embryonic trunkconnect perturbation of early differentiation pathways to progenitor cell behavior and structure morphology. Our work represents the first continuous molecular recording approach applied to dynamic in vitro models， a toolkit that can be combined with inhibitor libraries or other screening modalities to uncover the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that enable highly orchestrated and robust changes in cell state composition during critical windows of morphogenesis.,Single-cell RNAseq data were collected from Tracer TLS at 120h after aggregation (2 individual structures and one Multiseq experiment containing 24 structures， 12 Tracer TLS and 12 Tracer TLSCL).

ChIP-seq analysis of Arid1a and C/ebpÎ± in the mouse livers,GSE65167,Mus musculus,Arid1a is the subunit of SWI/SNF complex， which was reported to guide SWI/SNF to DNA. Here， we found that loss of Arid1a in the liver and other adult tissues results in improved organ regeneration. Within SWI/SNF complexes， Arid1a physically interacts with C/ebpÎ±， a hepatocyte transcription factor that drives maturation and limits proliferation. Genome-wide analysis showed that loss of Arid1a reduces the recruitment and activity of C/ebpÎ± on target promoters， resulting in expression programs that favor regeneration and cellular fitness during injury. Arid1a binding is enriched in promoters near transcriptional start sites (TSSs)， and C/ebpÎ± binds at precisely the same positions， indicating that Arid1a facilitates C/ebpÎ± binding across the genome.,Perfuse and isolate primary hepatocytes from mice livers， analysis of genomic occupancy of C/ebpÎ± and H3K4me2 in hepatocytes from Arid1a WT and Arid1a liver specific KO mice by ChIP-seq.

Chromatin Landscape Instructs Precise Transcription Factor Regulome during Embryonic Lineage Specification [RNA-seq],GSE250177,Mus musculus,Embryos originate from fertilized eggs and are shaped through continuous cell division and differentiation， accompanied by dramatic changes in transcription， translation， and metabolism. Epigenetic information and transcription factors (TFs) play indispensable roles in regulating these processes. Recently， the trophoblast regulator TFAP2C was found to be essential in initiating the earliest cell fate decisions. However， Tfap2c transcripts are still detectable in both the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) of blastocysts， raising questions regarding how TFAP2C functions once these two lineages are established. In this study， we delineated the dynamics of TFAP2C during the mouse peri-implantation stage and elucidated its collaboration with the key lineage regulators CDX2 and NANOG. Importantly， we proposed that de novo formation of H3K9me3 in the extraembryonic ectoderm during implantation antagonizes TFAP2C binding to crucial developmental genes， thereby maintaining its lineage identity. Together， this research highlights the plasticity of the epigenetic environment in designating the genomic binding of highly adaptable lineage-specific TFs and regulating embryonic cell fates.,Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology， we knocked out both Suv39h2 and Prdm2 genes. Mouse extraembryonic ectoderm was collected at E6.5 and E7.5 stages for total RNA-seq sequencing， and three replicates of sequencing data were obtained before and after the gene knockout.,38643480,Cell Rep
Osr2 functions as a mechanical checkpoint to augment CD8+ T cell exhaustion [Osr2OE_vs_Vector_RNA_CD8],GSE223163,Mus musculus,The alteration in extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and stiffness becomes one of the hallmarks of cancer. Whether the mechanical property of ECM contributes to the functionality of CD8+ T cells， a key component of anti-tumor response， remains largely unknown. Here we report that mechanical stress drives T cell exhaustion program via Osr2， a transcription factor that had been poorly investigated in T cells. Osr2 is highly and selectively induced in CD8+ T cells when encountering stiff matrix or mechanical force signaling (MFS). Integrated genetic and multi-omics analyses reveals that Osr2 is enriched in the terminal exhausted tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and its expression is modulated by the combined TCR and MFS mediated by Piezo1/Calcium/CREB axis. Importantly， depletion of Piezo1 or Osr2 alleviates T cell exhaustion， which is associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity mediated by antigen specific T cells or CAR-T cells in solid tumor models. On the contrary， forced Osr2 expression in CD8+ T cells augment their exhaustion and dampens tumor control. In agreement with these observations， high Osr2 expression is correlated with poor prognosis in multiple human malignancies. Mechanistically， Osr2 recruits HDAC3， which in turn establishes epigenetic reprogramming to suppress cytotoxic genes expression and to promote CD8+T cell exhaustion. Thus， our results unravel a mechanical signaling cascade centered by Osr2 that serves as a key driver for CD8+ T cell exhaustion and suggest that mechanical checkpoints could be promising targets for cancer immunotherapy.,RNA-seq analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens followed by activation and transduction with retroviruses encoding Osr2 (Osr2OE) or control GFP.,nan,

Transcriptomic characterization of in vitro human iPSC-derived motor neuron systems for the exploration of cell autonomous mechanisms and modifiers of TDP-43 perturbation associated neurotoxicity,GSE261875,Homo sapiens,Transactive Response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a multifunctional nuclear protein ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Although it is primarily nuclear， Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients frequently present with cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 in motor neurons on post-mortem examination. Although only about 5% of all ALS patients have a TARDBP mutation (Ghasemi and Brown 2018; Ingre et al. 2015)， which is known to cause these insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates， 97% of ALS patients will develop cytoplasmic， insoluble TDP-43 aggregates regardless of whether they have a mutation in TARDBP or not (Ling et al. 2013). Overexpression of wild-type TDP-43 has previously been shown to be a valid model of inducing neurotoxicity as well as a limited amount of cytoplasmic re-localization and aggregation characteristic of ALS (Elden et al. 2010; Wils et al. 2010). In the search for modifiers of toxicity as conferred by TDP-43 overexpression in these models， knockout of Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) was proposed as a protective intervention in the context of TDP-43 perturbation in non-human model systems (Elden et al. 2010， Becker et al. 2017). This promising finding had not previously been validated in a human motor neuron system， nor had a thorough investigation been conducted to determine the mechanism of neuroprotection that ATXN2 knockout employs to drive the therapeutic effect. This sequencing study examines both ATXN2 intact and ATXN2 knockout motor neurons in the context of TDP-43 perturbation to explore global transcriptomic changes that arise from these changes in cellular state that are associated with progression of ALS (ATXN2 intact) and what pathways could be implicated in protection from ALS-associated neurodegeneration (ATXN2 Knockout).,To investiage global transcriptomic changes resulting from TDP-43 perturbation via overexpression， we performed bulk RNA sequencing on isogenic motor neuron lines with and without induced TDP-43 perturbation at the same time point. Samples compared are an Empty Vector Control and a YFP expression only control as negative controls， wild-type TDP-43 overexpression， and cytoplasmically locked TDP-43 expression (TDP-43ÎNLS). The cytoplasmic TDP-43 condition was included because it is represenative of the end physiological state of ALS patients. There are four biological replicates of each sample present in this study.This study also examines the role of Ataxin-2 (ATXN2)， a proposed modifier of TDP-43 associated neurodegeneration， by including isogenic motor neuron lines (from the same background as the above mentioned TDP-43 perturbed lines) harboring Ataxin-2 knockout (conferred via CRISPR). This allows for comparison and discovery of factors that are exclusively modulated when Ataxin-2 is knocked out and whether those have an effect on the set of factors perturbed when TDP-43 is overexpressed or cytoplasmically constrained. Ataxin-2 knockout samples are available in this data set also in the Empty Vector， YFP only， TDP-43 overexpression， and TDP-43ÎNLS conditions. These samples are also presented as the results of four biological replicates each.,nan,

Acute multi-level response to defective de novo chromatin assembly in S-phase,GSE262518,Homo sapiens,Long-term perturbation of de novo chromatin assembly during DNA replication has profound effects on epigenome maintenance and cell fate. The early mechanistic origin of these defects is unknown. Here， we combine acute degradation of Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1)， a key player in de novo chromatin assembly， with single-cell genomics， quantitative proteomics， and live-microscopy to uncover these initiating mechanisms in human cells. CAF-1 loss immediately slows down DNA replication speed and renders nascent DNA hyper-accessible. A rapid cellular response， distinct from canonical DNA damage signaling， is triggered and lowers histone mRNAs. As a result， histone variants usage and their modifications are altered， limiting transcriptional fidelity and delaying chromatin maturation within a single S-phase. This multi-level response induces a cell-cycle arrest after mitosis. Our work reveals the immediate consequences of defective de novo chromatin assembly during DNA replication， explaining how at later times the epigenome and cell fate can be altered.,RPE1 degron cell line was treated for 2h with or DMSO (ctrl) or 1ÂµM  dTAG-V1 to induce CHAF1A degradation and disrupt de novo nucleosme assembly. Treated cells where then subjected to Repli-ATAC-seq， VASA-seq and scEdU-seq experiments to assess chromatin accessibility， transcriptome and DNA replication dynamics.,38585916,bioRxiv
VGLL1 regulates extraembryonic lineage specification in human [ATAC-Seq],GSE193612,Homo sapiens,Placenta abnormality is one of the key reasons for early pregnancy loss but the regulatory mechanisms underlying placenta formation are largely unknown. Here， we applied a human naÃ¯ve pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derived TE model to explore the driven regulatory machinery. We demonstrate that VGLL1 (vestigialÂ likeÂ familyÂ memberÂ 1) is crucial for TE self-renewal and TE-specific gene expression， thus suppressing VGLL1 leads to severely impaired cell proliferation and skewed TE induction. VGLL1 exerts its function through interacting with TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) and colocalize at target gene promoters and enhancers. Further investigation uncovers the enrichment of H3K27ac active histone marks at genomic regions occupied by VGLL1-TEAD4 complex， indicates a close association between them. Overall， our data reveals the critical function model of VGLL1-TEAD4 in human TE derivation， highlighting a potential interspecies difference between human and mouse TE induction.,Human naÃ¯ve PSC were plated at a density of 100000 cells per well onextracellular matrix (ECM; Geltrexâ¢)-coated 6-well plates and cultured with TE medium. Cells were collected for sequencing on day 5. For human TSC cells， cells cultured in TS-1 medium for five or six days were plated on Collagen IV coated 6-well plates and cultured with TSC medium. Cells cultured in TSC medium became morphologically stable after 2-3 passages.,38233381,Nat Commun
Transcription in Pronuclei and One- to Four-Cell Embryos Drives Early Development in a Nematode,GSE46277,Ascaris suum,A long-standing view of development is that transcription is silenced in the oocyte until early divisions in the embryo. The point at which major transcription is reactivated varies in different organisms， but is usually after the 2-cell stage. However， this model may not be universal. We used RNA-seq and exploited the protracted development of the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum， to provide a comprehensive time course of mRNA expression， degradation， and translation during early development. Surprisingly， we find that ~4，000 genes are transcribed prior to pronuclear fusion and in the 1-4 cell embryos. Intriguingly， we do not detect maternal contribution of many orthologs of maternal C. elegans mRNAs， but instead find these are newly transcribed in the A. suum zygote prior to pronuclear fusion. Ribosome profiling demonstrates that， in general， early embryonic mRNAs are not stored for subsequent translation， but are directly translated following their synthesis. The role of maternally contributed and zygotically transcribed genes differs between the nematodes A. suum and C. elegans despite the fact that the two nematodes appear to exhibit highly similar morphological patterns during early development. Our study indicates that major transcription can occur immediately after fertilization and prior to pronuclear fusion in metazoa， suggesting that newly transcribed genes appear to drive A. suum early development. Furthermore， the mechanisms used for controlling the timing of the expression of key conserved genes has been altered between the two nematodes， illustrating significant plasticity in the regulatory networks that play important roles in developmental outcomes in nematodes.,A total of 28 samples are used for this study. The RNAs for the library construction are derived from 0.5 â 1 ml of synchronized embryo stages corresponding to a minimum of 0.5 billion embryos derived from > 1，000 female worms. The RNAs for polysome analysis are from pooled fractions of polysome gradient. For each sample， the amount of RNA for all polysome fractions is equivalent to the total RNA from the sample. Thus， the data from polysome profiling and RNA transcriptomes are considered as biological replicates. The level of the RNAs between each neighboring stages during development are considered as the reference for each other. Different sequencing strategies were applied for multiple libraries.,24374308,Curr Biol
Impact of heavy metals on cold acclimation of Salix viminalis roots,GSE218490,Salix viminalis,Frost is a major abiotic stress limiting plant growth and development. Climate change models predict an increase in the magnitude and frequency of late-frost events， which， together with an observed loss of soil insulation， will significantly damage roots. To withstand freezing stress， plants have evolved an adaptative process known as cold acclimation. While this process is well documented， it is known that the plant response to multiple stresses is unique and cannot be deduced from the response to each stress taken separately. Here， we investigate the impact of long-term metal exposure on the cold acclimation of Salix viminalis roots. To do so， we used physiological， transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. We found that while metal exposure significantly affected plants morphology and physiology， it did not impede cold acclimation. The impact of the simultaneous exposure to metals and cold acclimation on the transcriptome was unique， while at the proteomic level， the cold acclimation component seemed to be dominant. Further analysis revealed that metals strongly and negatively impacted the cellular antioxidant system. While this should have led to a loss of frost tolerance， it was not observed. A group of proteins was identified that could have played a role in compensating the impediment of the antioxidative system in metal-exposed roots.,Cuttings of 10 cm of one individual S. viminalis were rooted in containers filled with a mix of 25 kg of potting soil and 17.5 kg sand under a controlled environment (23/20Â°C， 60% relative humidity， 16/8h photoperiod). After three weeks， plantlets were transferred to individual pots and half of them were exposed to a mixture of heavy metals (1.5 ppm Cd， 175 ppm Cu， 30 ppm Ni， 500 ppm Zn). After 40 days， half of the plants were randomly chosen and cold-acclimated (7/5Â°C， 60% relative humidity， 16/8h photoperiod) while the remaining was kept under control conditions. A total of four temperature-polymetallic contamination combinations were obtained， namely Control soil Temperate (CT)， Control soil Cold acclimated (CC)， Metals-polluted soil Temperate (MT) and Metals-polluted soil Cold acclimated (MC). Three biological replicates per conditions were analysed using RNA-Seq approach,38338824,Int J Mol Sci

CCR2 and CCR7 promote inflammatory monocyte recruitment through synergistic roles during encephalitic virus infection， but the monocyte response in the brain is dependent on the infecting virus,GSE254432,Mus musculus,Inflammatory monocytes (iMO) migrate from the bone marrow to the brain during viral encephalitis. For many viruses， including Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV)， iMO recruitment is dependent on the chemokine receptor CCR2. However， La Crosse virus (LACV) induces iMO recruitment independent of CCR2. Comparison of iMOs from HSV and LACV-infected mice showed higher expression of the g protein-coupled receptor CCR7 in LACV-induced iMOs. CCR2/CCR7 double knockout mice (DKO) had reduced iMO recruitment following LACV infection compared to CCR2 or CCR7 single knockout mice indicating that each receptor regulated iMO recruitment through complimentary roles. Thus， CCR7 is a novel， synergistic pathway to CCR2-induced iMO recruitment during virus infection. Interestingly， unlike HSV-recruited iMOs， LACV-recruited iMOs did not influence disease and had higher expression of proinflammatory and proapoptotic transcripts but reduced mitotic， phagocytic and phagolysosomal pathway transcripts. These findings indicate that virus-specific activation of iMOs may affect their survival， maturation and functional capabilities.,RNA was extracted from Â½ brains， and inguinal lymph nodes following a Trizol and chloroform protocol. Brain immune cells from 3 HSV and 3 LACV (both 2 females and 1 male) infected mice were prepared and labeled for FACs isolation as described above. Isolated iMOs from were lysed in RLT lysis buffer. The lysate was combined with additional RLT buffer and beta mercaptoethanol (MilliporeSigma， St. Louis， MO) to bring the final volume to 700 ÂµL with 1% BME. Samples were passed through QIAshredder column (Qiagen， Valencia， CA) at 21，000 x g for 2 minutes to homogenize any genomic DNA. RNA was extracted using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA mini columns (Valencia， CA). RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). RNA was quantitated using a fluorescence assay (Quant-it RiboGreen RNA， Thermofisher Scientific， Waltham， MA) on a Tecan Spark multiplate reader (Tecan， Switzerland). Starting with 200 pg of high-quality total RNA for each sample， volumes were concentrated via speed-vacuum to 9.5 ul. Sequencing libraries were constructed following the Takara SMART-Seq v4 PLUS protocol 011820 (Takara， Mountain View， CA) beginning with oligo(dT) priming/cDNA synthesis and following the manufacturers recommendations.  Modifications during cDNA amplification included the use of SeqAmp CB PCR Buffer with 14 cycles of PCR. After AmPure XP bead purification (Agencourt Biosciences， Beverly， MA)， cDNA quality was visualized and quantity assessed on a BioAnalyzer HS chip (Agilent Technologies， Inc.， Santa Clara， CA). Purified cDNA for each sample was normalized to 1.5 ng in 8 ul volume going into library preparation with the Stem-Loop Adaptor mix. Following 15 cycles of library amplification using balanced SMARTer RNA unique-dual index primers from 96U SetA kit 042121 for Illumina sequencing (Takara， Mountain View， CA)， individual libraries were cleaned using an 80% vol of AmPure XP beads， visualized on a BioAnalyzer HS chip， and quantified using the Kapa SYBR FAST Universal qPCR kit for Illumina sequencing (Kapa Biosystems， Wilmington， MA) on the CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories， Hercules， CA). Each final library was diluted to a final concentration of 1.5 nM and pooled together in equimolar concentrations for sequencing. After an initial MiSeq paired-end 2 X 150 cycle sequencing run was completed to confirm proper index balancing， samples were run on a NextSeq2k instrument using 1000pM of manually-denatured final library pool and sequenced on a P2 flowcell following a paired-end 2 X 100 run with 300 cycle chemistry.,38658802,Commun Biol

Cellular atlas of the human ovary using morphologically guided spatial transciptomics and single-cell sequencing [NanoString GeoMx],GSE260686,Homo sapiens,The reproductive and endocrine functions of the human ovary involve spatially defined interactions among highly specialized cell populations. Despite the importance of the ovary in female fertility and overall endocrine health， the functional attributes of ovarian cells and the complex structures in which they reside are largely uncharacterized， limiting our understanding of the key mechanisms of follicle development such as steroid hormone production and somatic-germ cells interactions. In this study we profiled the expression of >18，000 protein genes in 257 spatially defined human ovary samples to examine major types of functional units in the ovary， including areas enriched for oocytes， theca cells， and granulosa cells. To complement the spatial data， we generated single-cell RNA sequencing data for 21，198 past-QC cells from three additional donors and identified four major cell types and four immune cell subtypes. Custom selection of sampling areas and antibody-guided targeting of known cell types led to transcriptional profiles that are spatially highly specific， revealing distinct gene activities for early-stage oocytes and for theca and granulosa cells， respectively， all collected from their native tissue sites. These data significantly expanded the knowledge of molecular programs driving follicle development， contributing to a panel of 76 oocyte-specific genes including novel markers PADI6， UCHL1， ZFAND2A， and REC114， and similarly a 96- and 45-gene panel for granulosa and theca cells， respectively. Serial samples in follicle rings and across consecutive layers of the cortex and medulla uncovered spatial gradients in antral follicles and in the cortex surface， as well as previously unappreciated diversity of local gene expression patterns， reflecting regional variations of hormone signaling (NR4A1， CEBPD， STAR， and ADAMTS4) and extracellular matrix remodeling (VIM， COL1/8/12/14/16/18， and TIMP1/2).

The immunomodulatory of MSCs was also affected， enhancing the development of monocytes. In addition， stem cells maintain quiescence in hypoxia. This would contribute to understanding regulatory mechanisms for hematopoiesis under a hypoxic state， favouring our comprehension of perturbation， facilitating the manipulation of cell-based therapies.,single-cell RNA seq of bone marrow HSPCs from 7~8 week old mice with hypoxic treatment for 13 days and control,nan,
Chromatin-focused genetic and chemical screens identify BRPF1 as a targetable vulnerability in Taxol-resistant triple-negative breast cancer [CRISPR],GSE262577,Homo sapiens,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) stands out as a particularly aggressive and frequently recurring form of breast cancer. Due to the absence of hormone receptors， the available treatment avenues are constrained， making chemotherapy the primary approach. Unfortunately， the development of resistance to chemotherapy poses a significant challenge， further restricting the already limited therapeutic alternatives for recurrent cases. Understanding the molecular basis of chemotherapy resistance in TNBC is pivotal for improving treatment outcomes. Here， we generated two different Taxol-resistant TNBC cell lines with dose-escalation method to mimic chemotherapy resistance in vitro. These cells exhibited hallmark features of resistance， including reduced cell growth， altered morphology， and resistance to apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis uncovered elevated ABCB1 expression and multidrug-resistant phenotype in the resistant cells. To comprehensively investigate the key epigenetic regulators of Taxol resistance， we conducted epigenome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 and chemical probe library screens. Both screens pinpointed Bromodomain and PHD Finger Containing 1 (BRPF1) which is the reader protein in MOZ/MORF histone acetyl-transferase complex， as the regulator of Taxol resistance in TNBC cells. Knockout of BRPF1， but not the other members of the MOZ/MORF complex， sensitized resistant cells to Taxol. Additionally， BRPF1 inhibitors， PFI-4 and OF-1， in combination with Taxol significantly reduced cell viability. Transcriptome analysis upon BRPF1 loss or inhibition revealed a negative impact on ribosome biogenesis-related gene sets， resulting in a global decrease in protein translation in Taxol-resistant cells. Our ChIP-qPCR analysis further demonstrated that active BRPF1 directly interacts with the ABCB1 promoter， enhancing its expression and inducing a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Conversely， knockout or inhibition of BRPF1 leads to decreased ABCB1 expression. This dual mechanism critically sensitizes Taxol-resistant TNBC cells to chemotherapy. Our findings uncover a comprehensive molecular framework， highlighting the pivotal role of epigenetic reader protein BRPF1 in Taxol resistance and providing potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in TNBC.,To mimic chemotherapy resistance in vitro， we generated Taxol-resistant SUM159PT cell lines， namely T1-160 and T2-450. We first performed RNA-seq to uncover the differentially expressed genes in resistant cells when compared to parental cells. Later， we identified BRPF1 as a regulator of taxol resistance in T1-160 cells through epigenome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening and performed validation experiments using inhibitors or knockouts.,nan,
Developmental Dynamics of Kranz Cell Transcriptional Specificity in Maize Leaf Reveals Early Onset of C4-related Processes,GSE54272,Zea mays,The comparison of the cell-specific transcriptomes of bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M) cells from successive developmental stages of maize leafs reveals that the number of genes preferentially transcribed in one cell type or the other varies considerably from the sink-source transition to mature photosynthetic stages. The number of differentially expressed (DE) genes is maximal at a stage well prior to full maturity， including those that encode key functions for C4 photosynthesis. The developmental dynamics of BS/M differential expression can be used to identify candidates for other C4-related functions and to simplify the identification of specific pathways members from otherwise complex gene families. The candidates for C4-related transcription factors identified with this developmental DE strategy overlap with those identified in studies using alternative strategies.,Nine day old third leaves of maize sections， located at -1 cm， +4 cm and +9 cm (leaf tip)， relative to the sink-source transition， were collected. BS and M cells were captured from each section. There are two duplications for each section and each cell types. A total of 12 libraries were constructed for RNA-seq.,24790109,J Exp Bot
TRIM28-dependent developmental heterogeneity determines cancer susceptibility through distinct epigenetic states [RNA-seq - matched healthy and tumor tissues],GSE263021,Mus musculus,Mutations in cancer risk genes increase susceptibility， but not all carriers develop cancer. Indeed， while DNA mutations are necessary drivers of cancer， only a small subset of mutated cells go on to cause the disease. To date， the mechanisms underlying individual cancer susceptibility remain unclear. Here， we took advantage of a unique mouse model of intrinsic developmental heterogeneity (Trim28+/D9) to investigate whether early-life epigenetic variation influences cancer susceptibility later in life. We found that heterozygosity of Trim28 is sufficient to generate two distinct early-life epigenetic states associated with differing cancer susceptibility. These developmentally primed states exhibit differential methylation patterns at typically silenced heterochromatin， detectable as early as 10âdays of age. The differentially methylated loci are enriched for genes with known oncogenic potential， frequently mutated in human cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. This study provides genetic evidence that intrinsic developmental heterogeneity can prime individual， lifelong cancer susceptibility.,RNA sequencing of matched healthy and tumor tissues from multiple organs of Trim28 animals,39856421,Nat Cancer
Desiccation Tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds,GSE76015,Arabidopsis thaliana,Desiccation tolerance (DT) allowed seed plants to conquer ecosystems with long periods of limited water availability. This adaptive features allows seeds to remain dried for very long times without losing their ability to germinate. There is little information about all the signaling components required to achieve DT and on how transcription factors (TFs) modulate global DT processes. We performed RNA-seq experiment and carbohydrates profiles of lec1， lec2， fus3 and abi3， as well as their corresponding wild types， at three stages of seed development 15， 17 and 21 DAF (day after open flower) belonging to the seed desiccation period. A complex experimental design approach and regulatory networks prediction were used to identify differentially expressed genes specifically involved in DT process.,In order to identify mechanisms involved in the acquisition of DT during seed development， we designed a comparative transcriptomic analysis between the seed desiccation intolerant (DI) mutants lec1-1， abi3-5 and fus3-3， the desiccation tolerant mutant lec2-1 and the desiccation tolerant weak allele of abi3 (abi3-1) with their respective wild type controls. This analysis should allow to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the desiccation intolerant mutants respect to tolerant mutants and WT controls.,27551092,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
Single-cell multi-omics decodes regulatory programs during development of mouse secondary palate [bulk RNA-seq],GSE252592,Mus musculus,Perturbations in gene regulation during palatogenesis can lead to cleft palate， which is among the most common congenital birth defects. However， currently there is no comprehensive multiomics map of the developing secondary palate. Here， we perform single-cell multiome sequencing and profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression simultaneously within the same cells (n = 36，154) isolated from mouse secondary palate across embryonic days (E) 12.5， E13.5， E14.0， and E14.5. We construct five trajectories representing continuous differentiation of cranial neural crest-derived multipotent cells into distinct lineages. By linking open chromatin signals to gene expression changes， we characterize the underlying lineage-determining transcription factors. In silico perturbation analysis identifies transcription factors SHOX2 and MEOX2 as important regulators of the development of the anterior and posterior palate， respectively. In conclusion， our study chart epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics in palatogenesis， serving as a valuable resource for further cleft palate research.,The anterior (n=3) and posterior (n=3) 1/3 palatal shelves of embryonic day (E) 14.0 C57BL/6J mice were microdissected， isolated， and then subjected to bulk RNA-seq.,38280850,Nat Commun
Manipulating the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in T cells through CRISPR-induced alternative splicing of IKZF1 (RNAseq),GSE252707,Homo sapiens,Genome-wide association studies have identified statistically significant associations between genetic variants in or near the IKZF1 gene and several autoimmune disorders. IKZF1， encoding the transcription factor Ikaros， produces at least 10 distinct transcripts via alternative splicing.  To explore the role of alternative splicing of IKZF1 in mature T cells， we generated a panel of Jurkat T-cell clones with various truncating mutations in IKZF1 exon 4， exon 6 or both. Differences among clones in gene expression， chromatin accessibility， and protein abundance were assessed by RNA-seq， ATAC-seq and immunoblotting. Clones with single targeting events in either exon 4 or 6 clustered separately from double-targeted clones on multiple parameters， but overall， clone responses were highly heterogeneous. Perturbation of IKZF1 splicing resulted in significant differences in expression and chromatin accessibility of other autoimmunity-associated genes and elicited compensatory expression changes in other IKZF family members. Our results suggest that even modest perturbations of IKZF1 splicing can have significant effects on gene expression and function in mature T cells.,Exons 4 and 6 of the human IKZF1 gene in Jurkat cell lines were edited using CRISPR/Cas9. Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA-seq of four WT clones， seven clones with edits in IKZF1 exon 4， five clones with edits in IKZF1 exon 6， and eight clones with edits in IKZF1 exons 4 and 6. Analysis of gene expression was performed comparing WT clones to CRISPR-edited clones based on exons edited and protein detection.,nan,
Total and dendritic ribosome profiling from primary mouse cortical neurons,GSE213023,Mus musculus,Activity-dependent protein synthesis is critical for determining changes in dendritic proteomes underlying brain function， yet the mechanisms governing these changes are lacking. Here， we combined proximity-based labeling of dendritic transcriptome， translatome， and proteome to study the dynamics of RNA regulation in activated synapses. We discovered that depolarization leads to a switch from RNAs translated under basal conditions to new translation of previously unrecognized subsets of depolarization-dependent transcripts. Dynamically regulated RNAs bound by specific regulatory proteins， including NOVA1， FMRP， and ELAVLs， rapidly generate proteins with roles in mitochondrial regulation， RNA metabolism， translational control， and synaptic signaling in dendrites. Knockdowns of activity-induced dendritic RNAs altered neuronal physiology， underscoring how dynamic switches in the regulation of RNAs encoding coordinated sets of proteins underlie synaptic plasticity.,Four 150 mm cell culture dishes for resting and depolarized primary cortical neurons were combined per sample per replicate， 1/4th of which was spared for proteomics and rest for the ribosome profiling experiments. After a two-minute cycloheximide (Chx) treatment followed by a 30-minute biotin pulse， cells were quickly rinsed in ice-cold polysome gradient buffer (20 mM Tris pH7.5， 150 mM NaCl， 5 mM MgCl2， 1 mM DTT， and 100 Î¼g/ml CHX)， then scraped and lysed on plates on ice in 1 mL of ice-cold polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH7.5， 150 mM NaCl， 5 mM MgCl2 supplemented with 20 U/mL SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor， 24 U/mL Turbo DNase， 1 mM DTT， and 100 Î¼g/ml CHX， 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20，000 g for 2 minutes at 4Â°C， after which the supernatant was immediately loaded on to the cold 5 mL 7 kDa MWCO Zeba desalting column that was previously equilibrated with the ice-cold polysome gradient buffer. Lysates were subsequently flash-frozen or used for monosome fractionation. For monosome fractionation， lysates were added 5 mM CaCl2， incubated with micrococcal nuclease for 45 minutes at room temperature， quenched with 6.25 mM EGTA，Â and loaded on sucrose gradients. Gradients were then spun for 2 hours at 41K rpm in an SW-41 rotor and fractionated using BioComp Gilson fraction collection. 10% of the monosome fraction was kept for input. Triton X-100 was added to the remaining monosomes to a final concentration of 0.05%. The biotinylated monosomes were isolated using 50 Âµl of MyOne streptavidin C1 magnetic Dynabeads that were prepared according to the manufacturerâs guidelines and washed twice with Buffer A， twice with Buffer B， and once with polysome gradient buffer (with DTT and CHX). The monosome and bead mix was nutated at 4Â°C overnight. The supernatant was removed the next day， and the beads were moved into a new tube with low salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH8， 150 mM NaCl， 5 mM MgCl2， 1 mM DTT， and 100 Î¼g/ml CHX， and 0.1% Triton X-100)， and consequently washed three times for 10 minutes at 4Â°C with high salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH8， 500 mM NaCl， 5 mM MgCl2， 1 mM DTT， 100 Î¼g/ml CHX， and 0.1% Triton X-100).,38589584,Nat Neurosci
Transcriptomic changes induced by GFI1B variants,GSE244756,Homo sapiens,Mutations in transcription factor Growth Factor Independence 1B (GFI1B) cause inherited bleedings with varying intensity possibly caused by different effects on the transcriptional function of GFI1B. We studied transcriptomic changes of normal and GFI1BT174N，H181Y，R184P，Q287* mutants in megakaryoblast MEG01 cells using RNA-sequencing. Compared to normal GFI1B each variant affected different gene modules with limited overlap between variants. Remarkably， GFI1BQ287* specifically activated a myeloid-associated gene module. Based on this finding we studied megakaryocyte differentiation using normal and GFI1BQ287* patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) followed by single cell RNA-sequencing. This revealed a 45-fold decrease in the megakaryocyte/myeloid cell ratio in the GFI1BQ287* versus control condition. Moreover， myeloid specific genes were expressed within GFI1BQ287* but not normal megakaryocytes. Finally， we studied how megakaryocyte development was affected by inhibiting binding of GFI1B to Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1)， an interaction required for megakaryocyte development. Treatment of both MEG01 cells and normal IPSC-derived developing megakaryocytes with the small-molecule inhibitor GSK-LSD1 resulted in profound activation of myeloid gene programs within megakaryocytes， while the IPSC-derived megakaryocyte/myeloid ratio dropped two-fold. We conclude that GFI1B and LSD1 suppress myeloid differentiation allowing for proper megakaryocyte development. LSD1 inhibitor and GFI1BQ287*-mediated perturbation of this function causes myeloid skewing during megakaryocyte development.,To determine transcriptomic changes induced by GFI1B variants we retrovirally expressed GFI1BT174N， H181Y， R184P， Q287* next to normal GFI1B and an empty vector in megakaryoblast MEG01 cells followed by RNA-isolation and in triplicate RNA-sequencing 4 days later.,38548886,Commun Biol
Role of tRNA-derived fragments in the cross-talk between immune cells and beta cells during type 1 diabetes pathogenesis (Cyt-treated),GSE242566,Mus musculus,Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a central and well recognized role in protein synthesis. Recent studies revealed that these molecules can be cleaved to generate tRNA fragments (tRFs) with regulatory functions. Here， we studied the contribution of tRFs to pancreatic Î²-cell loss during the initial phases of type 1 diabetes (T1D)， an autoimmune disorder characterized by the invation of immune cells in the pancreas and progressive loss of insulin-secreting cells. Small RNA-profiling showed that the pool of tRFs present in pancreatic Î²-cells is altered in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice， a mouse model used to study T1D. We found that part of these changes is triggered by the exposure of Î²-cells to proinflammatory cytokines released during the autoimmune reaction while others result from the direct transfer of tRFs from autoreactive T lymphocytes to insulin-secreting cells via extracellular vesicles. Indeed， using an RNA-tagging approach， we could demonstrate that a group of tRFs are transferred in vivo in from CD4+CD25- T lymphocytes to pancreatic Î²-cells， upon T cell adoptive transfer in NOD scid mice. Morevoer， the up-regulation of selected tRFs associated with the autoimmune reaction triggers Î²-cell apoptosis and gene expression changes that affect the immune regulatory capacity of Î²-cells. Our data point to tRFs as novel players in type 1 diabetes and potentially in other autoimmune disorders.,Using NOD mice as a model of T1D， we detected a specific tRF signature in islet cells during the initial phases of the disease. Part of the changes in the tRF profile of pre-diabetic NOD mice is likely to be triggered by chronic exposure of islet cells to proinflammatory factors released by the invading immune cells. To determine the impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines on tRF levels， mouse islet cells were treated with IL-1Î²， TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ for 24h， prior to tRF profiling by small RNA-seq.,nan,
AMPK epidermal inhibition promotes HuR cytoplasmic localization eliciting post-transcriptional inflammatory response in psoriasis,GSE50598,Homo sapiens,IL-20 cytokines are involved in the establishment of psoriasis， a common chronic skin inflammation epidemiologically associated with metabolic syndrome， but molecular mechanisms underlying their over-expression remain to be elucidated. We find that keratinocytes (KCs) expressed IL-20 and lymphocytes expressed IL-22 cytokines up-regulation occurs at post-transcriptional level with stabilization of their RNA messengers. Looking at psoriatic epidermis， we observe that the p38/MK2 pathway is not activated but that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuR re-localizes in keratinocytes cytoplasm， suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of numerous mRNAs. HuR ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitations analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (RIP-Seq) identify potential pre-mature and mature RNA targets for uninvolved and involved skin and confirms that HuR activity is displaced from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Numerous psoriasis up-regulated transcripts are HuR targets and HuR knockdown reduces expression of transcripts like beta-defensin-2， CXCL-10 or IL-2， suggesting an implication of HuR in pathophysiological processes such as morphological， immune and metabolic inflammatory responses. Finally， metabolic disorders affecting psoriatic keratinocytes are responsible for HuR cytoplasmic localization since a decreased activity of the cellular metabolic sensor AMPK， that is observed in human psoriatic epidermis， is sufficient to promote HuR cytosolic localization as well as IL-20 over-production both in human keratinocytes and in vivo in mouse epidermis where it then initiates psoriasis-like histological changes. These results may provide insights into molecular links between metabolism and post-transcriptional networks during chronic inflammation， as illustrated in psoriasis by mechanisms connecting AMPK， HuR and IL-20.,Analysis of HuR-binding RNA in uninvolved versus involved psoriatic samples by RIP-Seq. Samples from five different patients were used for both uninvolved and involved skin. RIP-Seq was also made using a control IgG.,26176762,J Invest Dermatol
Osr2 functions as a mechanical checkpoint to augment CD8+ T cell exhaustion [Osr2OE_vs_Vector_ATAC_CD8],GSE223162,Mus musculus,The alteration in extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and stiffness becomes one of the hallmarks of cancer. Whether the mechanical property of ECM contributes to the functionality of CD8+ T cells， a key component of anti-tumor response， remains largely unknown. Here we report that mechanical stress drives T cell exhaustion program via Osr2， a transcription factor that had been poorly investigated in T cells. Osr2 is highly and selectively induced in CD8+ T cells when encountering stiff matrix or mechanical force signaling (MFS). Integrated genetic and multi-omics analyses reveals that Osr2 is enriched in the terminal exhausted tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and its expression is modulated by the combined TCR and MFS mediated by Piezo1/Calcium/CREB axis. Importantly， depletion of Piezo1 or Osr2 alleviates T cell exhaustion， which is associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity mediated by antigen specific T cells or CAR-T cells in solid tumor models. On the contrary， forced Osr2 expression in CD8+ T cells augment their exhaustion and dampens tumor control. In agreement with these observations， high Osr2 expression is correlated with poor prognosis in multiple human malignancies. Mechanistically， Osr2 recruits HDAC3， which in turn establishes epigenetic reprogramming to suppress cytotoxic genes expression and to promote CD8+T cell exhaustion. Thus， our results unravel a mechanical signaling cascade centered by Osr2 that serves as a key driver for CD8+ T cell exhaustion and suggest that mechanical checkpoints could be promising targets for cancer immunotherapy.,ATAC-seq analysis of CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens followed by activation and transduction with retroviruses encoding Osr2 (Osr2OE) or control GFP.,nan,
VGLL1 regulates extraembryonic lineage specification in human [RNA-seq II],GSE241813,Homo sapiens,Placenta abnormality is one of the key reasons for early pregnancy loss but the regulatory mechanisms underlying placenta formation are largely unknown. Here， we applied a human naÃ¯ve pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derived TE model to explore the driven regulatory machinery. We demonstrate that VGLL1 (vestigiallikefamilymember1) is crucial for TE self-renewal and TE-specific gene expression， thus suppressing VGLL1 leads to severely impaired cell proliferation and skewed TE induction. VGLL1 exerts its function through interacting with TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) and colocalize at target gene promoters and enhancers. Further investigation uncovers the enrichment of H3K27ac active histone marks at genomic regions occupied by VGLL1-TEAD4 complex， indicates a close association between them. Overall， our data reveals the critical function model of VGLL1-TEAD4 in human TE derivation， highlighting a potential interspecies difference between human and mouse TE induction.,Human naÃ¯ve PSCs were dissociated into single cells with a 1:1 mixture of 0.5 mM EDTA and TrypLE Express and plated at a density of 100，000 cell/well of 6-well plate on Geltrex in TE induction medium (1:1 mix of Neurobasal medium (Gibco) and DMEM/F12 (HyClone) supplemented with N2 (Gibco) and B27 (Gibco)， penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone)， Glutamax (Gibco)， Î²-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)， 1 ÂµM PD0325901 (Axon) and 1 ÂµM A83-01 (Selleck)) for five days.

A Highly Sensitive and Unbiased Approach for Elucidating Antibody Repertoires,GSE82126,Mus musculus,Developing B lymphocytes undergo V(D)J recombination to assemble germline V， D， and J gene segments into exons that encode the antigen-binding variable region of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and light (L) chains.  IgH and IgL chains associate to form the B cell receptor (BCR)， which upon antigen binding activates B cells to secrete BCR as an antibody.  Each of the huge number of clonally independent B cells expresses a unique set of IgH and IgL variable regions.  Ability of V(D)J recombination to generate vast primary B cell repertoires results from combinatorial assortment of large numbers of different V， D， and J segments， coupled with diversification of the junctions between them to generate the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) for antigen contact.  Approaches to evaluate in depth the content of primary antibody repertoires and， ultimately， to study how they are further molded by secondary mutation and affinity maturation processes are of great importance to the B cell development， vaccine， and antibody fields.  We now describe an unbiased， sensitive， and readily accessible assay， referred to as HTGTS repertoire sequencing (HTGTS-Rep-seq)， to quantify antibody repertoires.  HTGTS-Rep-seq quantitatively identifies the vast majority of IgH and IgL V(D)J exons， including their unique CDR3 sequences， from progenitor and mature mouse B lineage cells via the use of specific J primers.  HTGTS-Rep-seq also accurately quantifies DJH intermediates and V(D)J exons in either productive or non-productive configurations.  HTGTS-Rep-seq should be useful for studies of human samples， including clonal B-cell expansions and also for following antibody affinity maturation processes.,We employed high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing adapted repertoire sequencing (HTGTS-Rep-seq) to study antibody repertoires. For HTGTS-Rep-seq libraries， we utilize bait coding ends of J segments to identify， in unbiased fashion， mouse IgH DJH repertoires [processed tlx files] along with both productive and non-productive IgH V(D)J repertoires from both pro-B and peripheral B cells [processed xls files of samples 1-18， 21-51].  Similarly， we also identify mouse productive and non-productive Igk repertoires from peripheral B cells [processed xls files of samples 19，20，52-57].,27354528,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
Identification of the RNA Pyrophosphohydrolase RppH of Helicobacter pylori and Global Analysis of Its RNA Targets,GSE86943,Helicobacter pylori 26695,In this study targets of the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH in H. pylori 26695 (HP1228) were identified.,To investigate the global role of HpRppH (HP1228) in converting 5â triphosphates to monophosphates in H. pylori， we used a variant of differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) to compare the transcriptome of isogenic strains containing or lacking the rppH gene. For this purpose， we constructed two derivatives of the wild-type H. pylori strain 26695: an rppH deletion mutant (ÎrppH) and an rppH complementation strain (CrppH) bearing an ectopic copy of the rppH gene. The ÎrppH strain was generated by replacing the rppH gene of wild-type cells (WT) with a kanamycin-resistance cassette. The CrppH strain was then constructed by complementing this deletion with an ectopic copy of the H. pylori rppH gene under the control of its own promoter， which was introduced at an unrelated locus (rdxA) previously used as a site for integrating genes into the H. pylori chromosome. These isogenic H. pylori strains were grown to log phase， and total RNA isolated from each was used to generate three libraries specific for transcripts bearing (1) a 5'-triphosphate， (2) a 5'-monophosphate， or (3) either a 5'-triphosphate or a 5'-monophosphate. This was accomplished by differential treatment of cellular RNA with Terminator 5â-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (TEX) and Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP). The 5â exonuclease activity of TEX digests 5â-monophosphorylated RNAs but leaves triphosphorylated transcripts intact. Subsequent treatment of the latter set of transcripts with TAP generates monophosphorylated 5â ends to which an RNA oligonucleotide can be ligated， thereby enabling cDNA synthesis.  By contrast， treatment with TAP alone enables cDNA synthesis from both triphosphorylated and monophosphorylated RNAs， whereas treatment with neither enzyme allows cDNA synthesis only from cellular RNAs that are already monophosphorylated.  Therefore， to identify RNAs in each category， we generated cDNA libraries specific for transcripts with a 5'-triphosphate (+TEX/+TAP)， a 5'-monophosphate (-TEX/-TAP)， or both (-TEX/+TAP) from all three strains (Figure 5A) and subjected them to Illumina sequencing.,27974459,J Biol Chem
RoCK and ROI: a single-cell RNA-sequencing method with enhanced transcriptome information via targeted enrichment of transcripts and preselected， region-specific sequencing III,GSE266160,Mus musculus,Many scRNAseq-based methods suffer from a high number of non-detects and a bias towards the 3' or 5' end of transcripts. We developed a method termed RoCK and ROI to address these two biases. RoCK and ROI leads to the enrichment of the transcriptome profile of cells with information on transcripts of interest,RoCK and ROI is based on barcoded beads of the BD Rhapsody platform. For RoCKseq specific capture， TSO oligos on BD Rhapsody beads are modified with a/ multiple capture sequence(s) specific to transcripts of interest. ROIseq， on the other hand， is based on specific primers which are spiked in during library generation， directing reads to regions of interest (ROIs). Multiple scRNAseq experiments were performed on several biological samples to validate RoCK and ROI. To validate RoCK and ROI library generation， scRNAseq experiments were performed on a mix of murine and human cell lines expressing eGFP or tdTomato respectively. As a further validation of RoCK and ROI， epithelial and mesenchymal cells from a transgenic mouse strain (B6.129S4-Pdgfratm11(EGFP)Sor/J) were used.,nan,
Global ChIP-seq Normalization Reveals Epigenome Modulations,GSE60104,Drosophila melanogaster;Homo sapiens,Epigenomic profiling by ChIP-seq is a prevailing methodology used to investigate chromatin-based regulation in biological systems， such as human disease， yet the lack of an empirical methodology to normalize amongst experiments has limited the usefulness of this technique. Here we describe a âspike-inâ normalization method that allows the quantitative comparison of histone modification status across cell populations using defined quantities of a reference epigenome. We demonstrate the utility of this method in measuring epigenomic changes following chemical perturbations and show how control normalization of ChIP-seq experiments enables discovery of disease-relevant changes in histone modification occupancy.,ChIP-Seq of histone modifications H3K79me2 and H3K4me3 in human samples treated with EPZ-5676 with/without reference epigenome spike-in.,25437568,Cell Rep
An immunophenotype coupled transcriptomic atlas of human hematopoietic progenitors,GSE245108,Homo sapiens,Understanding the cellular heterogeneity and lineage potential of human bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors is required to understand normal differentiation and the mechanisms of hematological disease. Central to this objective are protocols that enable the delineation， isolation and functional characterization or known and novel cell populations， which are traditionally empowered by flow cytometry. Recognizing the need for tackling cellular heterogeneity， we have designed a use case for compiling next-generation processing methods via existing and highly curated single-cell interrogation technologies. Multi-omics approaches， such as Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq)， enable concurrent transcriptomic and immunophenotyping at a single-cell level but necessitate precision antibody titration mixes that can be directly integrated with parallel flow cytometry strategies. To bridge this gap， we performed a molecular titration of 266 antibodies using primary human bone marrow cells spanning race and sex to approximate diversity. Through machine learning and user curation， we created an optimized titrated bone marrow CITE-seq panel of 132 antibodies. Multimodal integration of these data using a game-theory driven approach， improved our ability to resolve new stable stem， progenitor， and transitional cell populations， readily defined by unique RNA and ADT markers. Leveraging complexity-matching high-dimensional flow cytometry (pyInfinityFlow)， we consolidated the findings from CITE-seq and subsequently developed novel isolation strategies for maturing granulocytes， late-stage erythroid progenitors and improved purification of megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEP). Finally， we integrated CITE-seq with flow cytometry data from matching donors， successfully identified 37 cell surface markers consistently expressed across donors and technologies. The compiled bone marrow cell atlas serves as an advanced digital analytical resource for progenitor analyses in health and disease.,CITE-seq molecular titration on four donors varing race and sex. Human bone marrow relevant ADTs and their best working concentration are determined. 132 ADTs titrated mix is used on four more donors and used to construct the atlas,38514887,Nat Immunol
Lactate regulates major zygotic genome activation by H3K18 lactylation in mammals [RNA-seq],GSE234025,Mus musculus,Lactate is present at a high level in the microenvironment of mammalian preimplantation embryos in vivo and in vitro. However， its role in preimplantation development is unclear. Here， we report that lactate is highly enriched in the nuclei of early embryos when major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs in humans and mice. The inhibition of its production and uptake results in developmental arrest at the 2-cell stage， major ZGA failure， and loss of lactate-derived H3K18lac， and the abnormal phenotypes could be recapitulated by overexpression of H3K18R mutation and rescued by addition of Lac-CoA. By profiling the landscape of H3K18lac in human and mouse preimplantation embryos， we show that H3K18lac is enriched on the promoter regions of most major ZGA genes and corelates with their expressions. Taken together， we demonstrate the important role for lactate in major ZGA via H3K18lac， showing a conserved metabolic mechanism underlies preimplantation development of mammalian embryos.,RNA-seq libraries were prepared as described previously. Briefly， 5 embryos were used per group， and three replicates were performed for each group. Embryos were washed three times in 0.5% BSA-PBS solution. cDNA was amplified using the Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher).

Opposing tumor cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic roles  of the IRF1 transcription factor in anti-tumor immunity,GSE246923,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Type I interferons (IFN-I) and IFN-ï§ foster antitumor immunity by facilitating T cell responses. Paradoxically， IFNs may promote T cell exhaustion by activating immune checkpoints. The downstream regulators of these responses are incompletely understood. Herein， we describe how Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1) orchestrates these opposing effects of IFNs. IRF1 expression in tumors blocked Toll-like receptor and IFN-I-dependent host antitumor immunity by preventing IFN stimulated gene (ISG) programs and effector programs in dendritic cells and T cells. In contrast， expression of IRF1 in the host， but not IRF3 or IFN-ï§， was also required for antitumor immunity to wildtype and Irf1-/- tumors. Mechanistically， tumor cell IRF1 regulated major histocompatibility class I expression and bound uniquely or together with STAT1 at many ISGs， contributing to expression of immunosuppressive but not immunostimulatory ISGs. Overexpression of PD-L1 in Irf1-/- tumors only partially restored tumor growth， suggesting that the negative effects of tumor IRF1 on antitumor immunity are multifactorial. Thus， we identify tumor cell IRF1 expression as a previously unrecognized selective inhibitor of host IFN-I dependent antitumor immunity， while host IRF1 and IFN-I are critical drivers of antitumor immune responses.,Wildtype and IRF1-/- MC 38 cells were stimulated with IFN-y for 2h. Chromatin from 0， and 2h stimlated samples was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against IRF1 or STAT1 followed by NGS library prep and sequencing in Illumina.Wildtype and IRF1-/- MC 38 cells (mouse colon cancer line) or M238 cells (human melanoma line)  were stimulated with IFN-y  for 2h or 6h. mRNA from 0， and 2h stimlated samples for MC38 and 0h and 6h stimulated samples for M238 cells were used for RNA-Seq library generation followed by NGS library prep and sequencing in Illumina instrument.WT and Irf1-/- MC38 tumors (pooled 4-6) from WT and Ifnar-/- mice on day12 were chopped into small pieces (2-4 mm size) before dissociation with Miltenyi's gentle MACS enzyme mix (# 130-096-730) in a Miltenyi GentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.， San Diego， CA) with pre- set 37C_mTDK_1 protocol.

Statistical inference with a manifold-constrained RNA velocity model uncovers cell cycle speed modulations,GSE250148,Homo sapiens,Across a range of biological processes， cells undergo coordinated changes in gene expression， resulting in transcriptome dynamics that unfold within a low-dimensional manifold. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) only measures temporal snapshots of gene expression， yet information on the underlying low-dimensional dynamics can be extracted using RNA velocity， which models unspliced and spliced RNA abundances to estimate the rate of change of gene expression.

Here， we found the conserved elongation factor， SPT6L， bound to thousands of intergenic regions in an RNA polymerase II (Pol II) independent manner. The intergenic enrichment of SPT6L， interestingly， co-occupied with the largest subunit of Pol V (NRPE1) and the mutation of SPT6L led to the reduction of DNA methylation but not Pol V enrichment. Furthermore， the association of SPT6L at Pol V loci was dependent on the Pol V associated factor， SPT5L， rather than the presence of Pol V， and the interaction between SPT6L and NRPE1 was compromised in spt5l. Finally， Pol V RIP-seq revealed that SPT6L is required to maintain the amount and length of Pol V transcripts. Our findings revealed the critical role of a Pol II conserved elongation factor in Pol V mediated DNA methylation and transcription， and shed light on the mutual regulation between Pol V and Pol II in plants.,10-day old seedlings were used for ChIP-seq， BS-seq， RNA-seq， and RIP-seq assays.,38796517,Nat Commun
Immuno-Oncologic Profiling by Stage-Dependent Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses of Spontaneously Regressing Canine Cutaneous Histiocytoma [NanoString],GSE261395,Canis lupus familiaris,Canine cutaneous histiocytoma (CCH) is a tumor originating from dermal Langerhans cells， especially affecting young dogs. The common spontaneous regression of CCH makes it an interesting model in comparative oncology research. Previous studies have indicated that anti-tumor immune responses may be involved but details remain speculative to date. Here， we asked which specific immuno-oncological dynamics underlie spontaneous regression of CCH on mRNA and protein levels. QuantSeq 3' mRNA sequencing with functional overrepresentation analysis and an nCounter RNA hybridization assay were employed on 21 formalin-fixed， paraffin-embedded CCH samples representing three different tumor stages. Nine additional samples were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Surprisingly， only minor stage-specific differences were found. When we investigated expression of B7 family ligands and CD28 family receptors holding co-stimulatory and -inhibitory functions respectively， we found higher abundance of CD80， CD86 and CD28， which trigger activation of lymphocyte-mediated immune responses. CD80 and CD86 expressing cells were further quantified by in situ hybridization and compared with data from three cases of canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS)， a malignant tumor variant originating from antigen presenting cells. A stage-specific increase of CD80 expression was recorded in CCH from the tumor bottom to the top， while CD86 was continuously and homogenously expressed at high levels. Expression of CD80 in CCH was similar to that in HS (73.3 Â± 37.4% versus 62.1 Â± 46.4% positive cells)， while CD86 was significantly higher expressed in CCH (94.7 Â± 10.3%) when compared to HS (57.6 Â± 11.0%). Our data suggest that major immuno-oncological pathways are seemingly not regulated during regression of CCH on the mRNA or protein levels as detectable by the methods used. We speculate that key signals leading to tumor regression may occur at an interactome level or at an earlier time point than examined here. Our data further supports a role of immune stimulatory B7 family ligands and CD28 family receptors in CCH regression.,To investigate stage-dependant differences of canine coutaneous histiocytoma (CCH) at the transcriptome level， RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffine-embedded (FFPE) material. Afterwards gene expression profiling was performed using RNA-Seq data from 4 different groups. Tumor-cell enriched groups (2a vs. 1) and lymphocyte-enriched groups (3 vs. 2b) were compared.,nan,
Gene-edited Mtsoc1 triple mutant Medicago plants do not flower,GSE247931,Medicago truncatula,Optimised flowering time is an important trait ensuring successful plant adaptation and crop productivity. SOC1-like genes encodeMADS transcription factors known to play important roles in flowering control in many plants. This includes the best characterisedeudicot model Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) where SOC1 promotes flowering and functions as a floral integrator geneintegrating signals from different flowering time regulatory pathways. Medicago truncatula (Medicago) is a temperate referencelegume with strong genomic and genetic resources used to study flowering pathways in legumes. Interestingly， despite respondingto the similar floral-inductive cues of extended cold (vernalisation) followed by warm long days， as winter annual Arabidopsis，Medicago lacks FLC and CO which are key regulators of flowering in Arabidopsis. Unlike Arabidopsis with one SOC1 gene， multiplegene duplication events have given rise to three MtSOC1 paralogs within the Medicago genus in legumes; one Fabaceae group ASOC1 gene， MtSOC1a， and two tandemly-repeated Fabaceae group B SOC1 genes， MtSOC1b and MtSOC1c. Previously， we showed thatMtSOC1a has unique functions in floral promotion in Medicago. The Mtsoc1a Tnt1 retroelement insertion single mutant showedmoderately delayed flowering in long and short day photoperiods， with and without prior vernalization， compared with wild type.On the other hand， Mtsoc1b Tnt1 single mutants did not have altered flowering time or flower development， indicating that it wasredundant in an otherwise wild type background. Here， we describe the generation of Mtsoc1 triple mutant plants by CRISPR-Cas9gene editing. Two independent Mtsoc1 homozygous triple mutants were non-flowering and bushy in floral inductive VLD.Phenotyping and gene expression analyses by RNA-seq and RT-qPCR indicate that the Mtsoc1 triple mutants remain vegetative. Thusoverall， the Mtsoc1 triple mutants are dramatically different from the single Mtsoc1a mutant and the Arabidopsis soc1 mutant;implicating multiple MtSOC1 genes in critical overlapping roles in the transition to flowering in Medicago.,To investigate the role of Medicago SOC1 genes， we carried out RNA-seq on single Mtsoc1a mutant and gene-edited triple Mtsoc1-4 mutant and compared to the relative wildtype.,38469328,Front Plant Sci
Mechanoresponsive genomic enhancers potentiate the cellular response to matrix stiffness [scRNA-seq],GSE243756,Homo sapiens,Epigenetic control of gene regulation and cell phenotype is influenced by changes in the mechanical microenvironment. Yet how mechanical forces precisely influence epigenetic state to regulate transcriptional responses remains largely unmapped. Here， we combine genome-wide epigenome profiling， epigenome editing， and phenotypic and single-cell RNA-seq screening to identify a sub-class of genomic enhancers that is responsive to the mechanical microenvironment. These enhancers regulate genes that act as key drivers for a variety of functional behaviors including apoptosis， mechanotransduction， proliferation， and migration. We find distinct patterns wherein subsets of mechano-enhancers can be preferentially active on either soft or stiff extracellular matrix (ECM) contexts. Epigenetic editing of these mechano-enhancers on rigid materials precisely tunes mechanically-induced gene expression to levels observed on softer materials， and broadly enables reprogramming of cellular response to the mechanical microenvironment. These mechanically-activated enhancers act as key signal transducers and may constitute a new class of targets that can be modulated to alter mechanically-driven disease states.,To determine the genes regulated by the pREs identified in the proliferation and migration screens， we made a sub-library of gRNAs targeting 87 of the pREs (10 gRNAs/pRE) with the largest effect sizes in either or both of the previous screens. This library also included positive controls of promoter-targeting and known enhancer-targeting gRNAs， and 100 non-targeting negative control gRNAs， for a total of 1，005 gRNAs in the sub-library. We transduced HFFs expressing dCas9KRAB cultured on TCP with this gRNA library at 0.33 MOI， and eight days post-transduction we profiled 103，440 quality single cell transcriptomes. We recovered a median of 1 gRNA per cell and identified an average of 159 cells containing each gRNA. To identify significant gene linkages to each pRE， we tested cells that had each gRNA versus all cells that did not receive that gRNA， and compared expression for all genes within +/- 1Mb from the targeted pRE.,38260455,bioRxiv
Vascular senescence and leak are features of the early breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimerâs disease models.,GSE243576,Mus musculus,Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is an age-related disease， with loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) being an early feature.  Cellular senescence is one of the reported nine hallmarks of aging. Here we show for the first time the presence of senescent cells in the vasculature in AD patients and mouse models of AD.  Senescent endothelial cells and pericytes are present in APP/PS1 transgenic mice but not in wild-type littermates at the time of amyloid deposition. In vitro， senescent endothelial cells display altered VE-cadherin expression and loss of cell junction formation and increased permeability. Consistent with this， senescent endothelial cells in APP/PS1 mice are present at areas of vascular leak that have decreased claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression confirming BBB breakdown. Further， single cell sequencing of endothelial cells from APP/PS1 transgenic mice confirms that adhesion molecule pathways are among the most highly altered pathways in these cells. At the pre-plaque stage the vasculature shows significant signs of breakdown， with a general loss of VE-cadherin， leakage within the microcirculation， and obvious pericyte perturbation. Although senescent vascular cells were not directly observed at sites of vascular leak， senescent cells were close to the leak area. Thus， we would suggest in AD there is a progressive induction of senescence in constituents of the neurovascular unit contributing to an increasing loss of vascular integrity. Targeting the vasculature early in AD， either with senolytics or with drugs that improve the integrity of the BBB maybe valid therapeutic strategies.,"Endothelial cells were isolated from the brain of WT and APP/PS1 mice using the Miltenyi Biotec reagents and protocol for ""Isolation and cultivation of endothelial cells from adult mouse brain"". The cells were then analysed using scRNA-seq.",37782439,Geroscience
TDP1 mutation causing SCAN1 neurodegenerative syndrome hampers the repair of transcriptional DNA double-strand breaks,GSE226263,Homo sapiens,TDP1 removes transcription-blocking TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1ccs) and its inactivating H493R mutation causes the neurodegenerative syndrome SCAN1. However， the molecular mechanism underlying SCAN1 phenotype is unclear. Here， we generate human SCAN1 cell models using CRISPR/Cas9 and show that they accumulate TOP1ccs along with changes in gene expression and genomic distribution of R-loops. SCAN1 cells also accumulate transcriptional DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) specifically in the G1 cell population due to increased DSB formation and lack of repair， both resulting from abortive removal of transcription-blocking TOP1ccs. Deficient TDP1 activity causes increased DSB production and the presence of mutated TDP1 protein hampers DSB repair by a TDP2-dependent back-up pathway. This study provides powerful models to study TDP1 functions under physiological and pathological conditions and unravels that a gain of function of the mutated TDP1 protein， which prevents DSB repair， rather than a loss of TDP1 activity itself， could contribute to SCAN1 pathogenesis.,DRIP-seq experiments (2 replicates) in TDP1 H493R (SCAN1) and WT U2OS cells,38761375,Cell Rep
RoCK and ROI: a single-cell RNA-sequencing method with enhanced transcriptome information via targeted enrichment of transcripts and preselected， region-specific sequencing,GSE266161,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual Series,nan,
Retinoic acid induces human gastruloids with posterior embryo-like structures,GSE208369,Homo sapiens,Gastruloids are a powerful in vitro model of early human development. However， although elongated and composed of all three germ layers， human gastruloids do not morphologically resemble post-implantation human embryos. Here we show that an early pulse of retinoic acid (RA)， together with later Matrigel， robustly induces human gastruloids with posterior embryo-like morphological structures， including a neural tube flanked by segmented somites， and diverse cell types including neural crest， neural progenitors， renal progenitors， and myocytes. Through in silico staging based on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)， we find that human RA-gastruloids progress further than other human or mouse embryo models， aligning to E9.5 mouse and CS11 cynomolgus monkey embryos. We leverage chemical and genetic perturbations of RA-gastruloids to confirm that WNT and BMP signalling regulate somite formation and neural tube length in the human context， while transcription factors TBX6 and PAX3 underpin presomitic mesoderm and neural crest， respectively. Looking forward， RA-gastruloids are a robust， scalable model for decoding early human embryogenesis.,Single-cell RNA-seq of human gastruloids and RA gastruloids,39164488,Nat Cell Biol
Altered lipid homeostasis underlies selective neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency [1 yr],GSE215832,Mus musculus,Spinocerebellar Ataxia Autosomal Recessive 20 (SCAR20) is a rare disorder caused by mutation in the SNX14 gene. The symptoms of the disorder including coarse face， poor or lack of speech， delayed or absent of motor function， and most markedly， cerebella atrophy with Purkinje cell degeneration. SNX14 has been localized to ER and shown to play a vital role in facilitating the formation of lipid droplet and maintaining the lipid saturation balance in cell membrane. Meanwhile， it has also been localized to other subcellular organelles， including lysosome and endo-lysosome， and has been suggested to participate in the autophagy responses. However， the previous researches were performed in vitro or ex vivo， and how disrupted SNX14 led to Purkinje cell degeneration in the SCAR20 cerebella in vivo remained unexplored. Here， we report the first animal model that manifested the SCAR20 symptoms， by introducing a 1bp deletion in Snx14 in mice via CRISPR-Cas9. We performed RNAseq to analyse the pathway changes caused by Snx14 KO.,We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of cerebella and cortices from 2-3 mice of SNX14 KO mice and their control littermates.,38625743,JCI Insight
Assessing chromatin accessibility in maize using ATAC-seq,GSE252638,Zea mays,The depiction of maize chromatin architecture using Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) provides great opportunities to investigate cis-regulatory elements， which is crucial for crop improvement. We demonstrate a streamlined ATAC-seq protocol for maize in which nuclei purification can be achieved without cell sorting， and using only a standard bench-top centrifuge. Our protocol， coupled with the bioinformatic analysis， provides a precise and efficient assessment of the maize chromatin landscape.,We perform the Maize seedling ATAC-Seq using only 2500 and 5000 nuclei， as well as the naked gDNA as control， in a total of three samples with two biological replicates， providing a new way to study the role of chromatin accessibility.,38863553,Front Plant Sci
GFI1B and LSD1 repress myeloid traits during megakaryocyte differentiation,GSE244609,Homo sapiens,Mutations in transcription factor Growth Factor Independence 1B (GFI1B) cause inherited bleedings with varying intensity possibly caused by different effects on the transcriptional function of GFI1B. We studied transcriptomic changes of normal and GFI1BT174N，H181Y，R184P，Q287* mutants in megakaryoblast MEG01 cells using RNA-sequencing. Compared to normal GFI1B each variant affected different gene modules with limited overlap between variants. Remarkably， GFI1BQ287* specifically activated a myeloid-associated gene module. Based on this finding we studied megakaryocyte differentiation using normal and GFI1BQ287* patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) followed by single cell RNA-sequencing. This revealed a 45-fold decrease in the megakaryocyte/myeloid cell ratio in the GFI1BQ287* versus control condition. Moreover， myeloid specific genes were expressed within GFI1BQ287* but not normal megakaryocytes. Finally， we studied how megakaryocyte development was affected by inhibiting binding of GFI1B to Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1)， an interaction required for megakaryocyte development. Treatment of both MEG01 cells and normal IPSC-derived developing megakaryocytes with the small-molecule inhibitor GSK-LSD1 resulted in profound activation of myeloid gene programs within megakaryocytes， while the IPSC-derived megakaryocyte/myeloid ratio dropped two-fold. We conclude that GFI1B and LSD1 suppress myeloid differentiation allowing for proper megakaryocyte development. LSD1 inhibitor and GFI1BQ287*-mediated perturbation of this function causes myeloid skewing during megakaryocyte development.,To determine transcriptomic changes induced by GFI1B variants we retrovirally expressed GFI1BT174N， H181Y， R184P， Q287* next to normal GFI1B and an empty vector in megakaryoblast MEG01 cells followed by RNA-isolation and in triplicate RNA-sequencing 4 days later.,38548886,Commun Biol
Circulating Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell subsets contribute to human hematopoietic homeostasis,GSE253485,Homo sapiens,In physiological conditions， few circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (cHSPC) are present in peripheral blood (PB) and their role remain unsolved. By integrating advanced immunophenotyping， high-throughput transcriptome profiling and functional assays we characterized the biological properties of human cHSPC. We found distinct composition but comparable bone marrow (BM) homing and differentiation potential after xenotransplantation of cHSPC with respect to their BM counterpart. Trafficking HSPC are in a low-cycling pre-activated state with primitive and committed progenitors being transcriptionally and functionally skewed towards erythroid differentiation. Moreover， a subset of circulating lymphoid progenitors are primed for seeding lymphoid organs and can actively contribute to T-cell production in patients treated with gene therapy. In case of hematopoietic impairment， cHSPC content and composition correlate with BM-HSPC state. Altogether， our data unveiled the cHSPC contribution to steady-state hematopoiesis， with a key function in sustaining extramedullary lympho- and erythro-poiesis， and supported their clinical exploitation as biomarker for BM-HSPC.,To compare the intrinsic molecular properties of HSPC subsets derived from BM and PB， we analyzed their transcriptional profiles by CITE-seq， which allows unbiased single-cell transcriptome and immunophenotypic analysis. To this aim， we exploited antibody derived tag (ADT)-labeled antibodies directed toward HSPC phenotypic markers. Human BM CD34+ (n=5) or PB CD34+ cells (n=4) or total PBMC (n=1) samples were thawed and stained with a mix of FACS antibodies and ADT-barcoded antibodies directed toward surface antigens used for the phenotypic classification of human HSPC. Then， we FACS sorted primitive (Lin- CD34+ CD38-) and/or bulk (Lin- CD34+) or committed (Lin- CD34+ CD38+) HSPC fractions， depending on the sample. Sorted fractions were processed according to Chromium 10x protocol， generating for each sample separated sequencing libraries from cDNA or ADT enriched fractions. Libraries were subsequently sequenced and resulting data were analyzed and integrated by bioinformatic approaches.,38446574,Blood
Trabectedin derails transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair to induce DNA breaks in highly transcribed genes,GSE245883,Homo sapiens,Most genotoxic anticancer agents fail in tumors with intact DNA repair. Therefore， trabectedin， a unique agent more toxic to cells with active DNA repair， specifically transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER)， provides new therapeutic opportunities. To unlock the potential of trabectedin and inform its application in precision oncology， a full mechanistic understanding of the drugâs TC-NER-dependent toxicity is needed. Here， we determined that abortive TC-NER of trabectedin-DNA adducts forms persistent single-strand breaks (SSBs) by blocking the second of the two sequential NER incisions by XPG. We mapped the 3â-hydroxyl groups of SSBs originating from the first NER incision at trabectedin lesions， recording TC-NER on a genome-wide scale. We showed that trabectedin-induced SSBs primarily occur in transcribed strands of active genes and peak near transcription start sites. Frequent SSBs were also found outside gene bodies， revealing TC-NER connection to divergent transcription from promoters. This work advances trabectedin as a tool compound for precision oncology and for studying TC-NER and transcription.,Genome-wide mapping of DNA breaks with GLOE-seq in U2OS WT， CSB knockout (-KO)， XPC-KO and XPA-KO cells as well as in HAP1 WT cells that were exposed to trabectedin (50 or 20 nM) or DMSO (as a control) in 1 to 3 biological replicates per exposure-cell line combination.

Plasticity and lineage commitment of individual Th1 cells are determined by stable T-bet expression quantities (ChIP-Seq),GSE266175,Mus musculus,T helper 1 (Th1) cell identity is defined by the expression of the lineage-specifying transcription factor T-bet. Here， we examine the influence of T-bet expression heterogeneity on subset plasticity by leveraging cell sorting of distinct in vivo-differentiated Th1 cells based on their quantitative expression of T bet and interferon ï§. Heterogeneous T bet expression states were regulated by virus induced type I interferons and were stably maintained even after secondary viral infection. Exposed to alternative differentiation signals， the sorted subpopulations exhibited graded levels of plasticity， particularly toward the Th2 lineage: T bet quantities were inversely correlated with the ability to express the Th2 lineage-specifying transcription factor GATA 3 and Th2 cytokines. Reprogramed Th1 cells acquired graded， but stable mixed Th1+2 phenotypes with a hybrid epigenetic landscape. Continuous presence of T-bet in differentiated Th1 cells was essential to ensure Th1 cell stability. Thus， innate cytokine signals regulate Th1 cell plasticity via an individual cell-intrinsic rheostat to enable T cell subset adaptation to subsequent challenges.,Adoptively transferred WT， Tbx21+/-， Tbx21-/- LCMVâTCRtg CD4+ Thy1.1+ cells from LCMV-challenged mice were isolated and MACS-sorted on day 10 of infection. Cells were cultured for two rounds under neutral (5 ng/ml IL-2 (Peprotech)， 10 Âµg/ml antiâIL-4 (11B11)， 10 Âµg/ml antiâIL-12 (C17.8)， and 10 Âµg/ml antiâIFN-g (AN18.17.24)) or Th2 conditions (30 ng/ml IL-4 (Sigma-Aldrich)， 5 ng/ml IL-2 (Peprotech)， 10 Âµg/ml antiâIL-12 (C17.8)， and 10 Âµg/ml antiâIFN-g (AN18.17.24)). On day 4 of the second round of stimulations the cells were harvested and processed for Chip-seq. Cells were incubated for 10min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde. Cross-linking was terminated by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125mM. ChIP was performed using iDeal ChIP-seq Kit (Diagenode) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

Two biological replicates per condition were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (50bp single-end) sequencing technology. 12 indexes were used per sequencing lane.,38838155,Sci Adv
Notch induces transcription by stimulating release of paused RNA Pol II without increasing chromatin accessibility [PRO-seq],GSE269115,Homo sapiens,Notch proteins undergo ligand-induced proteolysis to release a nuclear effector that influences a wide range of cell fate decisions by regulating gene activity. However， despite years of study， how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here， we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation， using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)， in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed， we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling， through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation， however， elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together， these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at the time of signal activation.,To determine how Notch signaling affects the behavior of RNA Polymerase II， Notch signaling was induced in SC2 cells by GSI washout. Cells were harvested at 15m， 30m， 45m， 1h， 90m， 2h， 3h， and 4h post Notch activation， and harvested for PRO-seq sample preparation. A reference condition was harvested immediately after mock GSI washout， and harvested for PRO-seq sample preparation.  There are 9 total conditions， with two replicates of the full experiment， and 3 replicates of the reference condition.,nan,

Antibody Fc-receptor common gamma chain FcÎµR1Î³ stabilizes cell surface receptors in group 3 innate lymphoid cells and promotes anti-infection immunity,GSE256409,Mus musculus,Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis and regulating inflammatory diseases， but the molecular mechanisms governing their phenotype and function are not fully understood. Here， we showed that ILC3s highly expressed Fcer1g gene， which encodes the antibody Fc-receptor common gamma chain (FcÎµR1Î³). Genetic perturbation of FcÎµR1Î³ led to the absence of critical cell membrane receptors NKp46 and CD16 in ILC3s. Alanine scanning mutagenesis identified two residues in FcÎµR1Î³ that stabilize its binding partners. FcÎµR1Î³ expression in ILC3s was essential for effective protective immunity against bacterial and fungal infections. Mechanistically， FcÎµR1Î³ influenced the transcriptional state and proinflammatory cytokine production of ILC3s， relying on the CD16-FcÎµR1Î³ signaling pathway. Overall， our findings highlight the significance of FcÎµR1Î³ as an adaptor protein that stabilizes cell membrane partners in ILC3s and promotes anti-infection immunity.,For bulk RNA-seq experiments， CCR6+ ILC3s were flow-sorted from the lamina propria (LPs) of Rorc-cre+Fcer1g f/f (CKO) mice and  Fcer1g f/f (control) mice on day 5 after the intravenously (i.v.) injection of Candida albicans (C.A.) or vehicle (PBS). Freshly sorted CCR6+ ILC3s from each group were then lysed for library construction using SMART-Seq2 prptocol. For the single cell (sc)RNA-seq experiment， immune cells were isolated from the small intestinal lamina propria (siLPs) and colonic lamina propria (cLPs) of control and CKO mice at steady state， labeled with hashtag and fluorescent antibodies prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Then the flow-sorted cells were pooled for gene expression library and Feature Barcode library construction via using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3Ê¹ Reagent Kits v3.1 (10ÃGenomics).,39013884,Nat Commun
Catalytic dependent and independent roles of Tet3 in activation of ectodermal and silencing of mesodermal programs during neuroectoderm specification,GSE237800,Mus musculus,In this study: (1) we distinguished Tet3 target genes that are regulated by its catalytic vs. noncatalytic functions in neuroectoderm (NE) cells by transcriptomic profiling of Tet3 wildtype (WT)， Tet3 catalytic mutant (Mut)， and Tet3 knockout (KO) NE cells by RNA-seq.

An in vivo CRISPR screen in chick embryos reveals a role for MLLT3 in specification of neural cells from the caudal epiblast,GSE267653,Gallus gallus,Developing tissues rely on the coordinated differentiation of stem cell populations in dynamically changing environments. The formation of the vertebrate neural tube is a well characterized example， where stem cells in the caudal epiblast differentiate to neural tissue while transitioning through a changing landscape of signals: rostro-caudally from Retinoic Acid (RA) to Wnt/FGF and dorsal-ventrally from sonic hedgehog to BMP. Despite an understanding of the signaling pathways involved in neural specification， the precise signal interpretation and gene regulatory mechanisms within an embryonic context remain poorly defined. To address this， we first developed an in vivo CRISPR screening approach in chick embryos. We then performed a multiplexed in vivo single-cell perturbation screen of transition genes from caudal epiblast to the neural tube. Our screen revealed a role for MLLT3， a component of the super elongation complex， in the specification of neural identity. MLLT3 is expressed in the epiblast and not the neural tube. Perturbation of MLLT3 disrupted caudal epiblast morphology， reduced neural tube identities， and resulted in the misregulation of genes involved in WNT and RA signaling. Neural specification was also disrupted by expressing mutant forms of Retinoic Acid Receptor A (RARÎ±) lacking the MLLT3 binding domain or consisting only the MLLT3 binding region. Together， these findings validate an in vivo CRISPR screen in chick embryos for the first time and identify a previously unreported role for MLLT3 in caudal neural cell specification， mediated through an interaction with RARÎ±.,HH8 chicken embryos were electroporated ex ovo with CRISPR system marked by Citrine fluorescence， allowed to develop for 24 hours， and subsequently enriched for successful electroporation via disociation and FACS for Citrine expression. Finally cells were profiled by single cell RNA sequencing on the 10x platform.,nan,

An integrated toolkit for human microglia functional genomics,GSE244653,Homo sapiens,Microglia， the brainâs resident immune cells， play vital roles in brain development， and disorders like Alzheimerâs disease (AD). Human iPSC-derived microglia (iMG) provide a promising model to study these processes. However， existing iMG generation protocols face challenges， such as prolonged differentiation time， lack of detailed characterization， and limited gene function investigation via CRISPR-Cas9.In this study will generated iMG from human iPSCs using our newly developed protocol. We used single cell RNA-Seq to study the transcriptomic profiles of our newly formed iMG. The single cell RNA-Seq data under this accession is from wild type iMG (Hashtag 7) and OTHER KO iMG (Hashtag 8),iPSC-derived microglia (iMG) were harvested from in vitro cultures， washed with PBS and hashtaged  with hash tagging antibodies as: WT: Hashtag 7， OTHER KO Hashtag 8. scRNA-Seq was performed using 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM single-cell 3' Reagent kit v3.1 leveraging its Feature Barcode technology.,38600587,Stem Cell Res Ther
A myeloid maturation program initiated by nucleotide depletion during S phase [scRNA-seq],GSE172300,Mus musculus,Certain cancers， such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML)， are caused by malignant stem cells that fail maturation. We sought to mechanistically understand how metabolism might regulate cell fate decisions and to identify metabolic differentiation agents that might be leveraged therapeutically.Â  We find that nucleotide â purine， pyrimidine， and deoxynucleotide â depletion leads to AML differentiation by way of replication stress. Modulation of nucleotide pools leads to transcriptional reprogramming， epigenetic remodeling， and initiation of differentiation which is dependent on the myeloid regulating transcription-factor PU.1. By single-cell RNA sequencing and microscopy， we find that reprogramming downstream of nucleotide depletion occurs as cells undergo replication stress and that the cell fate decision is initiated prior to completion of the cell cycle. Together， these findings suggest that nucleotide metabolism is a critical determinant of hematopoietic progenitor cell fate， clarify the coordination of the fate decision with the cell cycle， and expand upon the class of inhibitors that can be developed or repurposed as novel differentiation therapy.,Cell lines were treated with vehicle or drug for the indicated times and barcoded with MULTI-seq， and single-cell transcriptomes were sequenced on the 10X Genomics platform.,38823395,Dev Cell
Gene perturbation in human arterial smooth muscle cells under treatments promoting synthetic or contractile phenotype,GSE246269,Homo sapiens,Smooth muscle cell (SMC) gene regulatory networks are thought to play a role in atherosclerosis， a disease characterized by alterations to SMC phenotype. Based on analysis of multiple bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq atherosclerosis data sets， FRZB and ALCAM were prioritized as candidate regulators of a disease-associated gene expression program in SMC-s. The current RNA-Seq experiment was devised to study the contribution of these genes to SMC transcriptional phenotype under different treatment conditions.,RNA-Seq was used to profile gene expression in cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. The cells were transduced with lentivirus overexpressing FRZB or transfected with siRNA silencing ALCAM to study the effect of these genes. Empty vector lentivirus and negative control siRNA were used as controls， respectively. Cells were treated with TGFbeta or cholesterol (or mock-treated for no treatment control) to induce atherosclerosis-relevant cellular phenotypes.,38639096,Circ Res
Iterative deep learning-design of human enhancers exploits condensed sequence grammar to achieve cell type-specificity [scRNA-Seq],GSE269037,Homo sapiens,An important and largely unsolved problem in synthetic biology is how to target gene expression to specific cell types. Here， we apply iterative deep learning to design synthetic enhancers with strong differential activity between two human cell lines. We initially train models on published datasets of enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility and use them to guide the design of synthetic enhancers that maximize predicted specificity. We experimentally validate these sequences， use the measurements to re-optimize the predictor， and design a second generation of enhancers with improved specificity. Our design methods embed relevant transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs with higher frequencies than comparable endogenous enhancers while using a more selective motif vocabulary， and we show that enhancer activity is correlated with transcription factor expression at the single cell level. Finally， we characterize causal features of top enhancers via perturbation experiments and show enhancers as short as 50bp can maintain specificity.,We transfected a library of synthetic enhancers (R1-MPRA) into two different human cell lines， HepG2 and K562. We quantified enhancer strength at the single cell level and correlate enhancer activity with transcriptome analysis.,nan,
Barcode-free prediction of cell lineages from scRNA-seq datasets,GSE226169,Mus musculus,The integration of lineage tracing with scRNA-seq has transformed our understanding of gene expression dynamics during development， regeneration， and disease. However， lineage tracing is technically demanding and most existing scRNA-seq datasets are devoid of lineage information. By analyzing our own (mouse embryonic stem cells;mESCs) and public lineage-annotated scRNA-seq datastes， we could identify and characterize genes displaying conserved expression levels over cell divisions in multiple cell types. This resulted in the development of  Gene Expression Memory-based Lineage Inference (GEMLI)， a computational pipeline allowing to predict cell lineages over several cell divisions solely from scRNA-seq datasets.,CGR8 mESCs were barcoded using the LARRY cellular barcoding library and grown for 48h in N2B27 medium supplemented with 2i and LIF before analysis by scRNA-seq. Extraction of LARRY lineage barcodes in the scRNA-seq data allows to link single cell transcriptomes to lineage information.,38553478,Nat Commun
Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens identify DNMT1 as a druggable dependency in sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma [RNA-seq],GSE269462,Mus musculus,Sonic hedgehog subgroup of medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) is characterized by aberrant activation of the SHH signaling pathway. An inhibition of the positive SHH regulator Smoothened (SMO) has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy. Yet， primary and acquired resistance to SMO inhibitors limit their efficacy. An understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy is warranted to bridge this unmet need. Here， we make use of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in SMB21 and DAOY cells， in order to unravel genetic dependencies and drug-related genetic interactors that could serve as alternative therapeutic targets for SHH-MB. Our screens reinforce SMB21 cells as a faithful model system for SHH-MB， as opposed to DAOY cells， and identify members of the epigenetic machinery including DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as druggable targets in SHH-dependent tumors. We show that Dnmt1 plays a crucial role in normal murine cerebellar development and is required for SHH-MB growth in vivo. Additionally， DNMT1 pharmacological inhibition alone and in combination with SMO inhibition effectively inhibits tumor growth in murine and human SHH-MB cell models and prolongs survival of SHH-MB mouse models by inhibiting SHH signaling output downstream of SMO. In conclusion， our data highlight the potential of inhibiting epigenetic regulators as a novel therapeutic avenue in SMO-inhibitor sensitive as well as resistant SHH-MBs.,A murine cell line models of Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma (SMB21) was treated with 3ÂµM 5-azacytidine for 2 hours， 24 hours， or corresponding concentration of DMSO solvent.,nan,
Notch induces transcription by stimulating release of paused RNA Pol II without increasing chromatin accessibility [TT-seq],GSE269116,Homo sapiens,Notch proteins undergo ligand-induced proteolysis to release a nuclear effector that influences a wide range of cell fate decisions by regulating gene activity. However， despite years of study， how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here， we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation， using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)， in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed， we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling， through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation， however， elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together， these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at the time of signal activation.,To determine which genes are induced by Notch signaling in SC2 cells， and how SWI/SNF inhibition affects gene expression in the Notch response， Notch signaling was induced in SC2 cells by GSI washout. Cells were harvested at 1 and 4 hours post Notch activation， and immediately after mock GSI washout， and harvested for TT-seq sample preparation. Mock washout control samples were also harvested at 1 and 4 hours. For each of these time points， cells were either treated with SWI/SNF inhibitor (1 ÂµM BRM014) or 0.01% DMSO at the time of washout or mock-washout. There are 10total conditions， and two replicates of the full experiment.,nan,
Loss of skeletal muscle Bmal1 chromatin accessibility,GSE255376,Mus musculus,Investigate the effects loss of skeletal muscle Bmal1 has on gastrocnemius chromatin accessibility via ATAC-seq.,Gastrocnemius muscles were collected at 6 months of age from vehicle treated and iMSBmal1KO mice. Two whole gastrocnemius muscle (~300-350mg) were diced and then homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in homogenization buffer (Homogenization buffer (10mM HEPES， pH 7.5， 10mM MgCl2， 60mM KCl， 300mM sucrose， 0.1mM EDTA， 0.1% Triton， 1mM DTT， complete with mini protease inhibitor mix). Homogenates were spun at 300rpm for 3 minutes and supernatant containing nuclei moved to a new tube. This was repeated 3 times. The supernatant was then filtered through a 40Âµm cell strainer before centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes. The nuclei pellet was then resuspended in 1.2ml of homogenization buffer， gently triturated and 200Âµl loaded on top of several 2.15M sucrose cushions (10mM HEPES， pH 7.5， 10mM MgCl2， 60mM KCl， 2.15M sucrose， 0.1mM EDTA， 0.1% Triton， 1mM DTT， complete with mini protease inhibitor mix). Nuclei samples were centrifuged at 13，500g at 4Â°C for 1.5 hours. Samples were aspirated and washed leaving a nuclei pellet， mainly free of cytoplasmic fragments. Nuclei were quality checked using light microscopy (intact nuclei， no blebbing， free of cytoplasmic fragments) and then counted. 50，000 nuclei were used for input into a commercially available ATAC-seq kit which includes library preparation (#53150， Active Motif， Inc.， CA， USA).,38950777,Mol Metab
Transcription factor network dynamics during the commitment to oncogene-induced senescence [ATAC-Seq],GSE271459,Homo sapiens,Aberrant oncogenic signaling causes cells to transition into oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) to limit uncontrolled proliferation. Despite being a potent tumor suppressor mechanism， OIS is an unstable cell state susceptible to reprogramming that can promote tumorigenesis. Therefore， elucidating the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms that commit cells to OIS is critical to identifying actionable targets to modulate the senescence state. We previously showed that timely execution of the OIS program is governed by hierarchical transcription factor (TF) networks. However， the gene regulatory mechanisms that prime cells to commit to the OIS fate early upon oncogene hyperactivation are currently not known. Here， we leveraged our time-resolved multi-omic profiling approach to generate TF networks during the first 24 h of oncogenic HRASG12V activation. Using this approach， we demonstrate that the commitment to OIS requires the rearrangement of the TF network on a pre-established epigenomic landscape， priming the cells for the substantial chromatin remodeling that underpins the transition to OIS. Our results provide a detailed map of the chromatin landscape before cells transition to OIS thus offering a platform for manipulation of senescence outcomes of potentially therapeutic value.,Assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) in WI38-ER:RAS(G12V) cells (human lung fibroblasts) collected at indicated time-points post induction of oncogenic HRAS(G12V) with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment.,nan,
Human Accelerated Regions regulate gene networks implicated in apical-to-basal neural progenitor fate transitions,GSE270828,Homo sapiens,The evolution of the human cerebral cortex involved modifications in the composition and proliferative potential of the neural stem cell (NSC) niche during brain development. Genetic changes that altered the activity of transcriptional enhancers have been linked to phenotypic differences between humans and other primates. Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) consist of >1600 highly constrained noncoding regions of the genome that show significant evolutionary acceleration on the human lineage， suggesting they encode human-specific functions. Multiple studies support that HARs include neurodevelopmental enhancers with novel activities in humans， but the regulatory roles of HARs in NSC biology has not been empirically assessed at scale. Here we conducted a direct-capture Perturb-seq screen repressing 180 neurodevelopmentally active HARs in human iPSC-derived NSCs with single-cell transcriptional readout. After profiling over 188，000 NSCs， we identified a set of HAR perturbations with convergent transcriptional effects on gene networks related to the specification of basal radial glia (bRG)， a progenitor population that is expanded in humans. Processes associated with these networks included the regulation of apicobasal polarity and migration. We found convergent dysregulation of specific apicobasal polarity and adherens junction regulators， including PARD3， ABI2， SETD2， and PCM1， which are critical to apical-basal RG fate decisions. Autism- and intellectual-disability-associated genes were also enriched among genes showing changes in expression due to HAR perturbations. Our findings reveal interconnected roles for HARs in NSC biology and cortical development and link specific HARs to processes implicated in human cortical expansion.,Polyclonal human iPSC cells (line H23555， a gift from Y.

Quantitative analysis of cis-regulatory elements in transcription with KAS-ATAC-seq [Human KAS-ATAC-seq],GSE256230,Homo sapiens,Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression throughout diverse biological systems. Accurate identification and in-depth characterization of functional CREs are crucial for decoding gene regulation network and dynamics during cellular processes. In this study， we developed a new KAS-seq (Opti-KAS-seq) procedure， with enhanced efficiency of capturing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)， broader genomic coverage， and adaptability to various sample types. By integrating the highly sensitive Opti-KAS-seq with ATAC-seq， we further introduce KAS-ATAC-seq， a new method that provides quantitative insights into transcriptional activity of CREs. A main advantage of KAS-ATAC-seq lies in its precise measurement of ssDNA levels within both proximal and distal ATAC-seq peaks. This feature is particularly adept at identifying ssDNA promoter and Single-Stranded Transcribing Enhancers (SSTEs). SSTEs are highly enriched with nascent RNA transcripts and specific transcription factors (TFs) binding sites that determine cellular identity. Moreover， KAS-ATAC-seq provides a detailed characterization and functional implications of various SSTE subtypes; KAS-ATAC-seq signals exhibit more robust correlation with enhancer activities when compared with ATAC-seq data and active histone mark profiles. Our analysis of promoters and SSTEs during mouse neural differentiation demonstrates that KAS-ATAC-seq can effectively identify immediate-early activated CREs in response to RA treatment. We further discovered that ETS TFs and YY1 are critical in initiating early neural differentiation from mESCs to NPCs. Our findings indicate that KAS-ATAC-seq provides more precise annotation of functional CREs in transcription. Future applications of KAS-ATAC-seq would help elucidate the intricate dynamics of gene regulation in diverse biological processes and biomedical applications.,We developed a new KAS-seq procedure， Opti-KAS-seq， with enhanced efficiency of capturing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)， broader genomic coverage， and adaptability to various sample types.

CRISPRi-based screens in iAssembloids to elucidate neuron-glia interactions,GSE272093,Homo sapiens,The sheer complexity of the brain has complicated our ability to understand its cellular mechanisms in health and disease. Genome-wide association studies have uncovered genetic variants associated with specific neurological phenotypes and diseases. In addition， single-cell transcriptomics have provided molecular descriptions of specific brain cell types and the changes they undergo during disease. Although these approaches provide a giant leap forward towards understanding how genetic variation can lead to functional changes in the brain， they do not establish molecular mechanisms. To address this need， we developed a 3D co-culture system termed iAssembloids (induced multi-lineage assembloids) that enables the rapid generation of homogenous neuron-glia spheroids. We characterize these iAssembloids with immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptomics and combine them with large-scale CRISPRi-based screens. In our first application， we ask how glial and neuronal cells interact to control neuronal death and survival. Our CRISPRi-based screens identified that GSK3Î² inhibits the protective NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response in the presence of reactive oxygen species elicited by high neuronal activity， which was not previously found in 2D monoculture neuron screens. We also apply the platform to investigate the role of APOE-ð4， a risk variant for Alzheimerâs Disease， in its effect on neuronal survival. We find that APOE-ð4 expressing astrocytes may promote more neuronal activity as compared to APOE-ð3 expressing astrocytes.

Bulk RNA Sequencing of SUM159PT cells grown in 2D or from tumors formed in NOD mice,GSE223951,Homo sapiens,Cancer is a heterogeneous disease， where multiple， phenotypically distinct subpopulations co-exist. Tumor evolution is a result of a complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors. To predict the molecular drivers of distinct cancer responses， we apply single-cell lineage tracing (scRNA-Seq of barcoded cells) on a triple-negative breast cancer model. We propose GALILEO， a framework providing lineage tracing， transcriptomic， and chromatin accessibility information simultaneously at single-cell resolution (Multiome ATAC + gene expression on barcoded cells). The combination of single-cell lineage tracing with phenotypic assays allows to link a cell state with its fate.,SUM159PT cells were cultivated in 2D dishes (N=6) or transplanted (100k cells) in vivo in the mammary fat pad of NOD mice and collected when the tumors (N=5) reached 1.2 cm (with a typical latency of 30 days). Bulk RNA-seq was used to compare the transcriptome of SUM159 derived tumors compared to cells grown in 2D,39218912,Nat Commun
Graded arrays of spinal and supraspinal V2a interneuron subtypes underlie forelimb and hindlimb motor control [scRNA-seq],GSE108788,Mus musculus,The spinal cord contains neural networks that enable regionally-distinct motor outputs along the body axis. Nevertheless， it remains unclear how segment-specific motor computations are processed because the cardinal interneuron classes that control motor neurons appear uniform at each level of the spinal cord. V2a interneurons are essential to both fore and hindlimb movements and here we identified two major types that emerge during development: Type-I neurons marked by high Chx10 form recurrent networks with neighboring spinal neurons， and Type-II that downregulate Chx10 and project to supraspinal structures. Type-I and -II V2a interneurons are arrayed in counter-gradients and this network activates different patterns of motor output at cervical and lumbar levels. Single cell RNA-seq revealed Type-I and -II V2a neurons are each comprised of multiple subtypes. Our findings uncover a molecular and anatomical organization of V2a interneurons reminiscent of the orderly way motor neurons are divided into columns and pools.,Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) conducted on cervical and lumbar spinal V2a interneurons from 2 P0 neonates.

Temporal effects of BMP4 on mouse embryonic and extraembryonic development,GSE267870,Mus musculus,The developing placenta， originated in the mouse through the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE)， is essential for mammalian embryonic development. Yet， unbiased characterization of ExE differentiation dynamics and interaction with the embryo proper remains incomplete. Here， we develop a temporal single-cell model of mouse gastrulation that maps continuous and parallel differentiation in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. This is matched with a 3-way perturbation approach to target signaling from the embryo proper， the ExE alone， or both. We show that ExE specification involves early spatial and transcriptional bifurcation of uncommitted ectoplacental cone cells (EPCs) and chorion progenitors. Early BMP4 signaling from chorion progenitors is required for proper differentiation of uncommitted EPCs and later for their specification towards trophoblast giant cells. We also find bi-phasic regulation by BMP4 in the embryo. The early ExE-originating BMP4 signal is necessary for proper endo-mesoderm bifurcation， allantois， and primordial germ cells (PGCs) specification. However， commencing at E7.5， embryonic-derived BMP4 source restricts PGC pool size by favoring differentiation of their extraembryonic mesoderm precursors towards an allantois fate. ExE and embryonic tissues are therefore entangled in time， space， and signaling axes， highlighting the importance of their integrated understanding and modeling in vivo and in vitro.,We individually imaged each embryo and performed index-sorting for them with subsequent plate-based scRNA-seq (MARS-seq). For ex utero cultured embryos， we pooled 5 embryos and performed 10x single-cell RNA-seq on them for two time points (late streak and head fold stage embryos). For further analysis of mutant/perturbation data， query data was compared to an already established dataset [Mittnenzweig et al. Cell 2021] that was further enriched in this study. The projection of query cells over the atlas resulted in best matching WT embryos that were used to calculate time， cell state composition and differential gene expression between query and atlas cells.,39294373,Nature

Integration of epigenome and lactylome reveals the regulation of lipid production in Nannochloropsis oceanica,GSE261019,Nannochloropsis oceanica,Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a kind of novel post-translational modification (PTM)， which participates in gene expression and various metabolic processes. Nannochloropsis， a significant oleaginous microalgae of economic significance， demonstrates a remarkable capacity for triacylglycerol (TAG) production under nitrogen stress. To elucidate the involvement of lactylation in lipid synthesis， we conducted ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq analyses to monitor lactylation modifications and transcriptome alterations in Nannochloropsis oceanica. In all， 2，057 genes showed considerable variation between nitrogen deprivation (ND) and nitrogen repletion (NR) conditions， comprising 853 upregulated genes and 1，204 downregulated genes. Moreover， a total of 5，375 differential Kla peaks were identified， including 5，331 gain peaks and 44 loss peaks under ND vs NR. The differential Kla peaks were primarily distributed in the promoter (<= 1 kb) (71.07%)， 5âUTR (22.64%)， and exon (4.25%). Integrative analysis of ChIP-seq， transcriptome， and previous proteome and lactylome data elucidates the potential mechanism by which lactylation promotes lipid accumulation under ND. Lactylation facilitates autophagy and protein degradation， leading to the recycling of carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle， thereby providing carbon precursors for lipid synthesis. Additionally， lactylation induces the redirection of carbon from membrane lipids to TAG by upregulating lipases and enhancing the TCA cycle and Î²-oxidation pathways. This research reveals the regulatory functions of lactylation in lipid metabolism and gene expression in Nannochloropsis， offering a new perspective for the investigation of lipid biosynthesis.,Examination of lactylation modifications under nitrogen repletion and nitrogen deprivation in Nannochloropsis oceanica cells.,38842303,J Agric Food Chem

TRIM28-dependent developmental heterogeneity determines cancer susceptibility through distinct epigenetic states [RNA-seq - day 10 earclips],GSE263020,Mus musculus,Mutations in cancer risk genes increase susceptibility， but not all carriers develop cancer. Indeed， while DNA mutations are necessary drivers of cancer， only a small subset of mutated cells go on to cause the disease. To date， the mechanisms underlying individual cancer susceptibility remain unclear. Here， we took advantage of a unique mouse model of intrinsic developmental heterogeneity (Trim28+/D9) to investigate whether early-life epigenetic variation influences cancer susceptibility later in life. We found that heterozygosity of Trim28 is sufficient to generate two distinct early-life epigenetic states associated with differing cancer susceptibility. These developmentally primed states exhibit differential methylation patterns at typically silenced heterochromatin， detectable as early as 10âdays of age. The differentially methylated loci are enriched for genes with known oncogenic potential， frequently mutated in human cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. This study provides genetic evidence that intrinsic developmental heterogeneity can prime individual， lifelong cancer susceptibility.,RNA sequencing of day 10 ear clips from WT and Trim28 animals,39856421,Nat Cancer
Chromatin-focused genetic and chemical screens identify BRPF1 as a targetable vulnerability in Taxol-resistant triple-negative breast cancer [RNA-seq],GSE262353,Homo sapiens,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) stands out as a particularly aggressive and frequently recurring form of breast cancer. Due to the absence of hormone receptors， the available treatment avenues are constrained， making chemotherapy the primary approach. Unfortunately， the development of resistance to chemotherapy poses a significant challenge， further restricting the already limited therapeutic alternatives for recurrent cases. Understanding the molecular basis of chemotherapy resistance in TNBC is pivotal for improving treatment outcomes. Here， we generated two different Taxol-resistant TNBC cell lines with dose-escalation method to mimic chemotherapy resistance in vitro. These cells exhibited hallmark features of resistance， including reduced cell growth， altered morphology， and resistance to apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis uncovered elevated ABCB1 expression and multidrug-resistant phenotype in the resistant cells. To comprehensively investigate the key epigenetic regulators of Taxol resistance， we conducted epigenome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 and chemical probe library screens. Both screens pinpointed Bromodomain and PHD Finger Containing 1 (BRPF1) which is the reader protein in MOZ/MORF histone acetyl-transferase complex， as the regulator of Taxol resistance in TNBC cells. Knockout of BRPF1， but not the other members of the MOZ/MORF complex， sensitized resistant cells to Taxol. Additionally， BRPF1 inhibitors， PFI-4 and OF-1， in combination with Taxol significantly reduced cell viability. Transcriptome analysis upon BRPF1 loss or inhibition revealed a negative impact on ribosome biogenesis-related gene sets， resulting in a global decrease in protein translation in Taxol-resistant cells. Our ChIP-qPCR analysis further demonstrated that active BRPF1 directly interacts with the ABCB1 promoter， enhancing its expression and inducing a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Conversely， knockout or inhibition of BRPF1 leads to decreased ABCB1 expression. This dual mechanism critically sensitizes Taxol-resistant TNBC cells to chemotherapy. Our findings uncover a comprehensive molecular framework， highlighting the pivotal role of epigenetic reader protein BRPF1 in Taxol resistance and providing potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in TNBC.,To mimic chemotherapy resistance in vitro， we generated two different Taxol-resistant SUM159PT cell lines， namely T1-160 and T2-450. We first performed RNA-seq to uncover the differentially expressed genes in resistant cells when compared to parental cells. Later， we identified BRPF1 as a regulator of taxol resistance in T1-160 cells through epigenome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Next， we either knocked out BRPF1 by two different sgRNAs or inhibited via BRPF1 inhibitors (PFI-4 and OF-1) and performed RNA-seq to understand the changes in the transcriptome when BRPF1 is absent or inhibited.,nan,
Transcriptome analyses of Arabidopsis lines overexpressing distinct PLC genes to explore their contribution to drought tolerance,GSE270544,Arabidopsis thaliana,Overexpression (OE) of phospholipase C (PLC) promotes drought stress tolerance in various plant species. How PLC contributes to this phenotype is unknown. To investigate this， transcriptomic analyses of drought-stressed Arabidopsis plants were performed in wild type (WT) and four distinct PLC-OE backgrounds. To be able to measure the earliest responses in both root- and shoot tissues， a vermiculite-based assay was developed. Subsequent transcriptomics analyses revealed that WT plants responded relatively strongly to the drought， whereas all PLC-OEs lines responded to a lesser extent. Changes in various pathways were observed that were differentially regulated in WT. These include， i) several phospholipid metabolism genes， which may counteract the overexpression of PLC activity， ii) genes involved in the circadian rhythm， shifting to a more night-like expression pattern for the PLC-OE lines， iii) downregulation of several light reaction-related genes， and iv) upregulation of genes involved in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway. In the PLC-OE lines， a subset of genes involved in auxin signalling was found to be differently regulated under drought. Similarly， genes upstream of H2O2 production were found upregulated， while ROS-induced genes were downregulated. Though unable to pin point the primary cause of the drought tolerant phenotype in PLC-OE plants， several novel connections were identified， which are highlighted and discussed in more detail.,RNAseq of Arabidopsis WT and PLC OEs. Plants were first grown 9 days on agar， followed by 12 days of growth on vermiculite with growth media. After 7 days of either remaining in contact with growth media， or no contact with media (drought) whole roots systems and whole shoots were harvested between 1 and 5 pm， cycling between the different samples before returning to the replicates. 4 replicates were used for all WT and PLC5-OE samples， 3 replicated were used for all other PLC-OEs. A single plant was used per replicate. Samples were frozen， ground up with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from qiagen. Quality was checked by RIN measurements. with all root samples scoring at least 6.5 and all shoot samples at least 9. RNA was mixed with ERCC RNA spike-in Control mix 1， afterwards a poly-A enrichment was performed using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECt micro purification kit.

Attenuated effector T cells are linked to control of chronic HBV infection,GSE259231,Homo sapiens,Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8+ T cells play a dominant role during acute-resolving HBV infection but are functionally impaired during chronic HBV infection in humans. These functional deficits have been linked with metabolic and phenotypic heterogeneity， but it has remained unclear to what extent different subsets of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells still suppress viral replication. We addressed this issue by deep profiling， functional testing and perturbation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells during different phases of chronic HBV infection. Our data revealed a mechanism of effector CD8+ T cell attenuation that emerges alongside classical CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Attenuated HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were characterized by cytotoxic properties and a dampened effector differentiation program， determined by antigen recognition and TGFÎ² signaling， and were associated with viral control during chronic HBV infection. These observations identify a distinct subset of CD8+ T cells linked with immune efficacy in the context of a chronic human viral infection with immunotherapeutic potential.,Live HBV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted in 1，5mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf， Germany) containing 20Âµl PBS using BD Aria Fusion (BD， Germany).

Notch induces transcription by stimulating release of paused RNA Pol II without increasing chromatin accessibility [ATAC-seq],GSE269112,Homo sapiens,Notch proteins undergo ligand-induced proteolysis to release a nuclear effector that influences a wide range of cell fate decisions by regulating gene activity. However， despite years of study， how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here， we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation， using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)， in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed， we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling， through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation， however， elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together， these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at the time of signal activation.,To determine how Notch signaling affects chromatin accessibility， and how SWI/SNF inhibition affects chromatin accessibility in the Notch response， Notch signaling was induced in SC2 cells by GSI washout. Cells were harvested at 1， 2， and 4 hours post Notch activation， and immediately after mock GSI washout， and harvested for ATAC-seq sample preparation. Mock washout control samples were also harvested at 1， 2， and 4 hours. For each of these time points， cells were either treated with SWI/SNF inhibitor (1 ÂµM BRM014) or 0.01% DMSO at the time of washout or mock-washout. There are 14 total conditions， and two replicates of the full experiment.,nan,
Temporal recording of mammalian development and precancer [WES],GSE235118,Mus musculus,Insights into many biological phenomena requires knowing the temporal order of cellular events， which is traditionally achieved through continuous direct observations [1， 2]. An alternative solution leverages irreversible genetic changes， such as naturally occurring mutations， to create indelible markers that enables retrospective temporal ordering [3-8]. Using Native sgRNA Capture and sequencing (NSC-seq)， a newly devised and validated multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform， we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo while incorporating cell state and lineage information. Using this approach， we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during murine embryonic development， unconventional developmental relationships between cell types， and new epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. NSC-seq analysis of murine adenomas coupled to multi-omic and single-cell profiling of human precancers， with clonal analysis of 418 human polyps， demonstrated the occurrence of polyancestral initiation in 15-30% of colonic precancers， revealing their origins from multiple normal founders. Our study presents a multimodal framework that lays the foundation for in vivo recording， integrating synthetic or natural indelible genetic changes with single-cell analyses to explore the origins and timing of development and tumorigenesis in mammalian systems.,DNA was extracted from resected tumors and normal epithelial tissues using DNA Extraction Kits (Qiagen). Standard whole exome sequencing (WES) library was prepared using mouse exome panel (Twist Bioscience) and sequenced on S4 flow cells on NovaSeq6000 (PE150) to the targeted coverage (50X).

Identification of the dedifferentiation trajectory of the cells without Arid1a using single cell RNA-seq,GSE140924,Mus musculus,The primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from the liver tissue Arid1af/f mouse. To immortalize mouse primary hepatocytes， the isolated cells were first infected with lentivirus expressing simian virus 40 large-T protein (SV40LT)， and then cultured until proliferated cell colonies appear. Cells were further transformed with lentivirus expressing HrasV12D to generate a cell line called AB17， which were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 Âµg/ml penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37â with 5% CO2.To get insight into trajectory of dedifferentiation induced by Arid1a loss， we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on FACS-sorted GFP+ AB17 cells using Fluidigm C1 platform， and obtained the scRNA-seq data from 76 cells with Arid1a knockout induced by Ad-Cre and 73 cells infected with Ad-GFP as control. Significantly， these AB17 cells with or without Arid1a were classified to the two distinct clusters based on their scRNA-seq data via the unsupervised clustering with SC3 software and the dimensionality reduction analysis using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) visualization， where the major Ad-Cre infected AB17 cells were assembled into cluster 1 while the majority of AB17 cells with empty Ad-GFP as a control belonged to cluster 2. These data suggest that Arid1a loss obviously dysregulated the gene expression pattern， as represented by the top ten differentially expressed genes between these two clusters.,48h after infection with Ad-GFP and Ad-Cre， AB17 cells were sorted to get GFP positive cells. Single cell was captured， reverse-transcribed and amplified on Fluidigm C1 platform.

Strong Correlation of Gene Counts and Differentially Expressed Genes between a 3â² RNA-Seq and RNA Hybridisation Platform from Canine Archival Tissue [nCounter],GSE261791,Canis lupus familiaris,3' RNA-Seq and direct RNA hybridisation are conceptually different approaches for high throughput transcriptome analysis. The former generates next-generation sequencing libraries by targeting and amplifying 3'-end sequences of 60 to 80 nucleotides in length， whereas the latter quantifies transcripts of 800 pre-selected genes. Since both methods are applicable to short mRNA fragments， they are thought to allow for transcriptome analyses from formalin-fixed， paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissue containing partially degraded RNA. In this study， results of both approaches were compared on sample- and gene-wise count levels， gene expression strength and direction， as well as the overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Using two different oncological perspectives， i.e. a stage-dependent and entity-contrasting comparison on 35 FFPE canine tumours， both methods proved suitable for their use on archival tissues. A moderately to very strong overall count correlation was found (range of Pearson and Spearman means: 0.66 â 0.87). Of note， the gene-wise count correlations depended on gene expression strength. Finally， in the entity-contrasting comparison， expression direction correlated very strongly (range: 0.88 â 0.91) but DEGs only moderately overlapped (Jaccard index: 0.53). Aside from these figures， different practically relevant aspects of the two technologies offer distinctstage-contrasting advantages， depending on the objectives and design of a study. - Attention: this GEO submission includes the nCounterÂ® data from 25 of the 35 samples used in this study!

Intestinal epithelial adaptations to vertical sleeve gastrectomy defined at single-cell resolution,GSE234189,Mus musculus,The gut plays a key role in regulating metabolic health. Dietary factors disrupt intestinal physiology and contribute to obesity and diabetes， whereas bariatric procedures such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) cause gut adaptations that induce robust metabolic improvements. However， our understanding of these adaptations at the cellular and molecular levels remains limited. In a validated murine model， we leverage single-cell transcriptomics to determine how VSG impacts different cell lineages of the small intestinal epithelium. We define cell type-specific genes and pathways that VSG rescues from high-fat diet perturbation and characterize additional rescue-independent changes brought about by VSG. We show that Paneth cells have increased expression of the gut peptide Reg3g after VSG. We also find that VSG restores pathways pertaining to mitochondrial respiration and cellular metabolism， especially within crypt-based cells. Overall， our study provides unprecedented molecular resolution of VSGâs therapeutic effects on the gut epithelium.,Single-cell RNA-sequencing of small intestinal epithelial crypts and villi from three groups of adult male C57BL/6J mice after a 16-week dietary intervention and 5 weeks after surgery: (1) high-fat diet VSG mice， (2) high-fat diet sham mice， and (3) low-fat diet sham mice.,38309446,Genomics

Iterative deep learning-design of human enhancers exploits condensed sequence grammar to achieve cell type-specificity [RNA-Seq],GSE269036,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct,An important and largely unsolved problem in synthetic biology is how to target gene expression to specific cell types. Here， we apply iterative deep learning to design synthetic enhancers with strong differential activity between two human cell lines. We initially train models on published datasets of enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility and use them to guide the design of synthetic enhancers that maximize predicted specificity. We experimentally validate these sequences， use the measurements to re-optimize the predictor， and design a second generation of enhancers with improved specificity. Our design methods embed relevant transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs with higher frequencies than comparable endogenous enhancers while using a more selective motif vocabulary， and we show that enhancer activity is correlated with transcription factor expression at the single cell level. Finally， we characterize causal features of top enhancers via perturbation experiments and show enhancers as short as 50bp can maintain specificity.,We designed 3 plasmid libraries (R1-MPRA， R1-DHS， R2) of synthetic candidate enhancer sequences placed upstream of a minimal promoter (minP) and unique barcode sequence， and transfected them into two different human cell lines， HepG2 and K562. We quantified enhancer strength by sequencing the mRNA of transfected cells as well as the DNA of the plasmid libraries， and calculated a ratio of RNA barcode counts to DNA barcode counts. Two biological replicates of each cell line measurement were obtained.,nan,
Wheat-RegNet: An encyclopedia of common wheat hierarchical regulatory network,GSE207939,Triticum aestivum,Common wheat is one of the most widely cultivated staple crops worldwide. Elucidating the gene regulatory network will provide essential information for mechanism studies and targeted manipulation of gene activity for breeding. However， detecting cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor (TF) bindings in the extremely large intergenic regions of the wheat genome is challenging. Linking cis-regulatory elements and TF binding to target genes is even more difficult given that enhancers can function irrespective of the strand and distance from target genes. Combining genome-wide TF binding profiles， epigenomic patterns， and transcriptome analysis is a compelling approach to detect the hierarchical regulatory network. We generated and collected 189 TF binding profiles， 90 epigenomic datasets， and 2，356 transcriptomic datasets in common wheat， which were further integrated using machine learning approach to infer direct target genes and the hierarchical regulatory network. We developed a web-based platform， Wheat-RegNet， that provides four major functions: (i) to identify regulatory elements regulating input gene(s)， and to infer the tissue and environmental response specificity; (ii) to identify the TFs responsible for regulating input gene(s) or locus/loci; (iii) to construct the hierarchical regulatory network regulating input gene(s); and (iv) to browse hundreds of TF binding， epigenomic， and transcriptomic profiles of an input region or gene(s). Well-organized results and multiple tools for interactive visualization are available through a user-friendly web interface， making Wheat-RegNet a highly useful resource for exploring gene regulatory information for hypothesis-driven studies and for targeted manipulation for breeding research in common wheat.

Multiplex enhancer-reporter assays uncover unsophisticated p53 enhancer logic [STARR-seq],GSE76654,Homo sapiens,Analysis of p53 binding sites using multiplex enhancer reporter assays， ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data.Transcription factors establish and maintain the specific transcriptome of a cell by binding to genomic regulatory regions， thereby regulating the transcription of their target genes. Like many transcription factors， the DNA sequence-specific binding preferences of p53 are known. However， it remains largely unclear what distinguishes functional enhancers from other bound genomic regions that have no regulatory activity. In addition， the genome is scattered with seemingly perfect recognition sequences that remain unoccupied. To disentangle the rules of genome-wide p53 binding， we employed two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays， one using barcoded reporters and the other using enhancer self-transcription. We compared the activity of more than one thousand candidate p53 enhancers under loss and gain of p53 conditions and identified several hundred high-confidence p53-responsive enhancers. Strikingly， the large majority (99%) of these target enhancers can be characterized and distinguished from negative sequences by the occurrence of a single p53 binding site. By training a machine learning classifier on these data， and integrating the resulting genome-wide predictions with fifteen publicly available human p53 ChIP-seq data sets， we identified a consensus set of 1148 functional p53 binding sites in the human genome. Unexpectedly， this direct p53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions， while differences between experiments can be largely attributed to indirect non-functional binding. Our data suggest that direct p53 enhancers function in a context-independent manner and do not contain obvious combinatorial complexity of binding sites for multiple transcription factors. They represent a class of unsophisticated cell-autonomous enhancers with a single binding site， distinct from complex developmental enhancers that integrate signals from multiple transcription factors. This suggests that context-dependent regulation of p53 target genes is not encoded in the p53 enhancer， but at different upstream or downstream layers of the cell's gene regulatory network.,STARR-seq enhancer reporter assay to identify and validate p53-responsive enhancers.,27197205,Genome Res

Graded arrays of spinal and supraspinal V2a interneuron subtypes underlie forelimb and hindlimb motor control [RNA-seq],GSE108775,Mus musculus,The spinal cord contains neural networks that enable regionally-distinct motor outputs along the body axis. Nevertheless， it remains unclear how segment-specific motor computations are processed because the cardinal interneuron classes that control motor neurons appear uniform at each level of the spinal cord. V2a interneurons are essential to both fore and hindlimb movements and here we identified two major types that emerge during development: Type-I neurons marked by high Chx10 form recurrent networks with neighboring spinal neurons， and Type-II that downregulate Chx10 and project to supraspinal structures. Type-I and -II V2a interneurons are arrayed in counter-gradients and this network activates different patterns of motor output at cervical and lumbar levels. Single cell RNA-seq revealed Type-I and -II V2a neurons are each comprised of multiple subtypes. Our findings uncover a molecular and anatomical organization of V2a interneurons reminiscent of the orderly way motor neurons are divided into columns and pools.,Cervical and lumbar segments were dissected in aCSF， and cell dissociation was conducted using Papain following the manufacturerâs instruction (Worthington Biochemical).

Acetylation is not mere a consequence of transcription: histones are acetylated without ongoing transcription [ChIP-seq],GSE260922,Mus musculus,In all eukaryotes， acetylation of histones lysine residues correlates with transcription activation. Whether histone acetylation is a cause or consequence of transcription is debated. One model suggests that transcription promotes the recruitment and/or activation of acetyltransferases and histone acetylation occurs as a consequence of ongoing transcription. However， the extent to which transcription shapes the global acetylation landscapes is not known. Here we show that global protein acetylation remains virtually unaltered after acute transcription inhibition. Transcription inhibition ablates the co-transcriptionally occurring ubiquitylation of H2BK120 but does not reduce histone acetylation. The combined inhibition of transcription and CBP/p300 further demonstrates that acetyltransferases remain active and continue to acetylate histones independently of transcription. Together， these results show that histone acetylation is not a mere consequence of transcription; acetyltransferase recruitment and activation is uncoupled from the act of transcription and histone and non-histone protein acetylation are sustained in the absence of ongoing transcription.,H3K27ac ChIP-seq experiments in ESC with or without actinomycin D or NVP-2 treatment.

Olfactory neuroblastoma mimics molecular subtypes and lineage trajectories of small cell lung cancer [Spatial transcriptomics on de-identified human ONB samples],GSE244117,Homo sapiens,The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB)， a rare， aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here， we establish a new， highly-penetrant， genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies， including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs)， which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC)， mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1， NEUROD1， and POU2F3- like states， an immune-cold tumor microenvironment， intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages， and subtype plasticityâas evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively， our findings highlight conserved developmental trajectories between ONB and SCLC subtypes with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment.,We performed multiplexed and spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling using the NanoString GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP) platform， with mostly default parameters. 5 Âµm sections from high quality archival ONB tissue blocks was mounted on glass slides for profiling. In total， we included 12 seperate ONB specimens， and 1 normal control OE. Two adjacent sections were cut and positioned on separate slides to allow for side-by-side H&E comparison. Following deparaffinization， antigen retrieval was performed with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) in a steamer for 20 min. Slides were then incubated for 15 min at 37Â°C in PBS buffer with 0.1 Âµg/mL proteinase K for RNA target exposure. In situ hybridization was conducted by incubating slides with GeoMx Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas Probe Mix (NanoString) overnight at 37Â°C. Slides were then stained with fluorescence-conjugated morphology markers for two hr at RT with the following labels: Syto 83 nuclear dye (NanoString) 250nM， CD45-532 (NovusBio cat# NBP2-34528AF532) 7.50Âµg/mL， TUBB3-594 (Biolegend， cat# 657408) 1:50， KI67-647 (CST cat# 12075) 1:100. Slides were then loaded on the NanoString GeoMx DSP instrument， and 2-3 representative ROIs in spatially distinct locations were selected based on tumor morphology and antibody staining markers. In general， ROIs were 200-600Âµm in diameter， and contained 100-300 nuclei. Note， some tumor specimens also contained normal overlying OE， which was captured for controls. ROIs were then segmented based on morphology markers， and RNA probe oligos were photocleaved and collected in the following order: CD45， KI-67， TUBB3， negative. Oligos were then processed for library preparation according to the standard Nanostring protocol， with the exception that beads were dried for 1 min instead of 5. DNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S-Prime flow cell with a read length of 2x27bp and a 5% PhiX spike-in by volume.

Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions， technologies， and species,GSE110513,Homo sapiens,Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition， technology， or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However， identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple datasets remains challenging. Here， we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq datasets based on common sources of variation， enabling the identification of shared populations across datasets and downstream comparative analysis. Implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/)， we use our approach to align scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) under resting and stimulated conditions， hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies， and pancreatic cell âatlasesâ generated from human and mouse islets. In each case， we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets， while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets， potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation， disease， and evolution.,Human PBMCs were profiled using ddSeq and bulk RNA-seq.  The ddSeq experiment was performed on unperturbed PBMCs. The bulk RNA-seq experiments were performed on both unperturbed and IFN-beta stimulated PBMC-derived populations (cDCs and pDCs) with three technical replicates.,29608179,Nat Biotechnol
Transcriptome-wide characterization of genetic perturbations,GSE264667,Homo sapiens,Single cell CRISPR screens such as Perturb-seq enable transcriptomic profiling of cellular perturbations at scale. However， the data produced by these screens are inherently noisy， limiting power to detect true effects with conventional differential expression analyses. Here， we introduce TRanscriptome-wide Analysis of Differential Expression (TRADE)， a statistical framework which estimates the transcriptome-wide distribution of true differential expression effects from noisy gene-level measurements.,This repository contains data from two large-scale pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA sequencing readout (ie Perturb-seq) experiments in Jurkat and HepG2 cells. Jurkat and HepG2 screens were conducted in parallel.

Functional assessement of putative myometrial enhancers by the CRISPR activation system,GSE244732,Homo sapiens,Timely control of parturition is crucial for maternal and fetal health. Failures on this biological process often result in pregnancy complications including preterm birth， labor dystocia， and health disorders on newborn babies. The myometrium is the muscular structure of the uterus maintaining uterine structural integrity and providing contractile force for parturition. The myometrial structure changes in adaptation to the pregnancy via stage-specific transcriptomic profiles. Data from the mouse model indicate that changes of myometrial epigenomic landscape precedes the adoption of stage-specific gene expression pattern at term. The present study documents the transcriptomic profile and epigenomic landscape of term pregnant myometrial tissues and functionally characterize a subset of putative enhancers to further understand the enhancer-gene interaction in human the myometrium.,Guide RNAs (gRNA) were uitilized to recruite the dCas9-VPR CRSIPR activators to putative enhancers of interest for promoting gene expression in the immortalized human myometrial cell line hTERT-HM cells. Cells that carried gRNA-expressing and dCas9-VPR-expressing lentiviral vectors were isolated by cell sorters. The single cell RNAseq assay was performed on the sorted cells to detect gRNA expression and profile the single cell transcriptome in the same cell (Perturb-Seq).,nan,
scCRISPR-screen in human monocyte derived macropahges,GSE210950,Homo sapiens,To determine whether the hits derived from a genome-wide murine BMDM screen regulated human macrophage phenorypes， we established a framework that coupled genetic perturbation with phenotypic analysis at single-cell resolution in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM scCRISPR-seq).,MDM scCRISPR-seq combines highly efficient electroporation-based CRISPR gene editing with a perturbation-specific barcoding strategy using cell hashing antibodies， allowing for a pooled sequencing format of 84 conditions per donor.

Single cell RNA sequencing of nc886， a non-coding RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III， with a primer spike-in strategy,GSE269878,Homo sapiens,Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a versatile tool in biology， enabling comprehensive genomic-level characterization of individual cells. Currently， most scRNA-seq methods generate barcoded cDNAs by capturing polyA tails of mRNAs， which excludes many non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)， especially those transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Although previously thought to be expressed constitutively， Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs are expressed variably in healthy and disease states and play important roles therein， necessitating their profiling at the single cell level. In this study， we have developed a measurement protocol for nc886 as a model case， as an initial step for scRNA-seq for Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs. Specifically， we spiked in an oligo-tagged nc886-specific primer during the polyA tail capture process for the 5â-reading in scRNA-seq. We then produced sequencing libraries for standard 5â gene expression and oligo-tagged nc886 separately， to accommodate different cDNA sizes and ensure undisturbed transcriptome analysis. We applied this protocol in three cell lines which express high， low， and zero levels of nc886， respectively. Our results show that the identification of oligo tags exhibited limited target specificity， and sequencing reads of nc886 enabled the correction of non-specific priming. These findings suggest that gene-specific primers (GSPs) can be employed to capture RNAs lacking a polyA tail， with subsequent sequence verification ensuring accurate gene expression counting. Moreover， we embarked on an analysis of differentially expressed genes in cell line sub-clusters with differential nc886 expression， demonstrating variations in gene expression phenotypes. Collectively， the primer spike-in strategy allows us for a combined analysis of ncRNAs and gene expression phenotype.,We developed a method to measure nc886 using scRNA-seq， involving spiking an nc886-specific primer during polyA tail capture for 5â sequencing. Separate sequencing libraries were prepared for standard 5â gene expression and nc886 to handle different cDNA sizes and maintain transcriptome analysis integrity. This approach was tested on three cell lines with varying nc886 expression levels.,nan,
SET-9 and SET-26， the C. elegans homologs of human MLL5， are critical for germline development and longevity,GSE100623,Caenorhabditis elegans,SET-9 and SET-26 are highly homologous paralogs that share redundant function in germline development， but SET-26 alone plays a key role in longevity and heat stress response. SET-26 is broadly expressed， but SET-9 is only detectable in the germline， which likely account for their different biological roles. SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 in vitro and in vivo， and their loss results in broadening of H3K4me3 domains. SET-9 and SET-26 also regulate the RNA expression of a subset of their target genes， irrespective of their H3K4me3 status. We propose that SET-9 and SET-26 function to organize local chromatin environment and to regulate the expression of specific target genes， and these activities together contribute to their critical roles in germline development， stress response， and longevity. SET-9 and SET-26 are highly homologous to human MLL5， a factor implicated in leukemia and glioblastoma， and our findings help to provide new insights into MLL5.,H3K4me3 in N2 and set-9 set-26; and SET-9/26 ChIP; RNA-seq for N2， set-9， set-26 and set-9 set-26,29714684,Elife
Specific pre-plasma cell states and local proliferation at the dark zone â medulla interface characterize germinal center-derived plasma cell differentiation in lymph node (Figure2) III,GSE275123,Mus musculus,High affinity antibody-producing plasma cell (PC) production in germinal centers (GC) is crucial for antibody-mediated immune protection after vaccination or infection. The selection of high affinity B cells in the GC light zone instructs PC differentiation in a subset of cells， but the phenotype， differentiation trajectory and spatial localization of those prePC intermediates remain to be characterized. Here， we have used a mouse model to track GC-derived B cells with integrative single-cell and spatial analyses in draining lymph node after immunization. We first identified putative prePC in scRNA-seq datasets， then enriched those cells through their specific surface phenotype for further analysis of their gene expression trajectories and BCR repertoire. We found a continuum of actively proliferating transitional states bridging selected LZ GC B cells and recently exported PCs， with gradually increasing levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated genes and immunoglobulin transcripts. Spatial analyses revealed that recently differentiated PC continued their maturation and proliferation at the interface between the DZ and extensions of the lymph node medulla. Our results provide insights into the intermediate stages and microenvironmental factors involved in the differentiation of GC B cells into PC， with implications for vaccine development and understanding antibody responses.,Mice were immunized with 100Âµg of NP-KLH at 1Âµg/ÂµL emulsified with Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS) at a 1:1 (v:v) ratio， subcutaneously at the base of the tail， 50Âµl on each side. For induction of the Cre-ERT2-mediated labelling， we gavaged the mice once with 5mg of tamoxifen (TS648-1G， Sigma) in 200ÂµL of peanut oil (P2144-250 ML， Sigma)， at least 6 days after immunization. Mice were euthanized at day 10， day 16 and day 22 of the primary response. For experiments described in Figure 2a， cells from draining lymph nodes were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 5% FCS and 2 mM EDTA) at a concentration of 10E8 cells/ml. Samples from different mice and different time points were processed separately using cell hashing as described (DOI : 10.1038/s41592-019-0392-0). Cells were individually stained with distinct barcoded anti-mouse CD45 antibodies (in-house conjugated) in FACS buffer for 30 minutes on ice. Subsequently， cells were washed and stained with a mix of primary antibodies， then Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermofisher). Live cells of interest (IgDneg eYFP+ PC and B cells) from each sample were bulk-sorted using a BD Influx cell sorter. PC and non-PC were captured in distinct wells for droplet-based scRNA-seq to maximize the recovery of BCR sequence information from non-PC. Within each fraction， cells from different samples were pooled and loaded for the 10x Genomics Single Cell 5' v2 workflow. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications for generating B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing libraries. Following cDNA amplification， SPRI select beads were used to separate the large cDNA fraction derived from cellular mRNAs (retained on beads) from the hashtag oligonucleotide (HTO)-containing fraction (in supernatant). For the mRNA-derived cDNA fraction， 50 ng were used to generate the transcriptome library， and 10-20 ng were used for BCR library construction. Gene expression libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. For BCR libraries， heavy and light chain cDNAs were amplified by two rounds of PCR (6 cycles + 8 cycles) using external 12  primers recommended by 10x Genomics. Approximately 800 pg of purified amplified cDNA was tagmented using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) and amplified for 12 cycles using the SI-PCR forward primer (10x Genomics) and a Nextera i7 reverse primer (Illumina). For the HTO-containing fraction， 5 ng were used to generate the HTO library. The resulting libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform with single-indexed paired-end kits following the manufacturerâs guidelines.,nan,
Single-cell analysis reveals lasting immunological consequences of influenza infection and respiratory immunisation in the pig lung,GSE249866,Sus scrofa,The pig is a natural host for influenza viruses and integrally involved in virus evolution through interspecies transmissions between humans and swine. We employed scRNA-seq and flow cytometry to characterize the major leucocyte subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)， twenty-one days after H1N1pdm09 infection or respiratory immunization with an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein with or without IL-1Î². Mapping scRNA-seq clusters from BAL onto those previously described in peripheral blood facilitated annotation and highlighted differences between tissue resident and circulating immune cells. ScRNA-seq data and functional assays revealed lasting impacts of immune challenge on BAL populations. First， mucosal administration of IL-1Î² reduced the number of functionally active Treg. Second， influenza infection upregulated IFI6 in BAL cells， decreasing their susceptibility to virus replicationâ¯in vitro. Our data provide a reference map of BAL cells following respiratory infection or immunization in a highly relevant large animal model for respiratory virus infection.,Samples obtained from a previous experiment conducted on inbred Babraham pigs were utilized (Schmidt et al.， 2023). Briefly three groups of 5 pigs each， were treated as follows: 1) infected intranasally with 8x106 PFU of A/swine/England/1353/2009 (pH1N1) using a mucosal atomization device (MAD); 2) immunized intranasally with 1x109 particles of recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing NP from H1N1/PR8/34 virus and HA from pH1N1/Texas/05/2009 (Ad-HA/NP) using a MAD and 3) immunized intranasally with a mix of 1x109 particles of Ad-HA/NP and 1x109 particles recombinant adenoviral vector encoding porcine IL-1Î² (Ad-HA/NP+Ad-IL-1Î²) using a MAD. Control pigs (n=3) received PBS intranasally. The animals were culled three weeks later， and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)， tracheobronchial lymph nodes and blood collected. Virus shedding and immune responses in respiratory tissues and peripheral blood were described in (Schmidt et al.， 2023). Cryopreserved BAL cells were thawed， washed and resuspended in PBS. Cells were incubated with antibodies against CD4 (clone 74-12-4， PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated， BD Biosciences)， CD8Î² (clone PPT23， FITC-conjugated， Bio-Rad)， CD3 (clone PPT3， APC-conjugated， Southern Biotech)， CD16 (clone G7， AF647-conjugated， Bio-Rad)， CD172a (clone 74-22-15， PE-conjugated， Bio-Rad) and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor780 (ThermoFisher). After two washes in PBS， cells were fixed， washed again and sorted on a FACSAria UIII (BD Biosciences)， equipped with 405， 488， 561 and 640nm lasers and BD FACSDiva 8 software. After gating on FSC-AdimSSC-Adim cells and exclusion of doublets and dead cells， CD4+， CD8Î²+ and CD3-CD16- (to enrich for B cells) cells were sorted (12，000 cells per population). In addition， after gating on FSC-AbrightSSC-Abright cells， doublet and dead cell exclusion and gating on CD16+CD172a+ cells， 12，000 macrophages were sorted. Cells from each fraction were pooled and subjected to partitioning and barcoding on a 10x Genomics Chromium iX Controller. For 10X， single cells were processed with the Chromium iX controller， using the Next GEM chip G， and single cell 3â kit v3.1 library preparation kit (10X Genomics， Pleasanton， CA). An estimated 10，000 cells were targeted for recovery during partitioning. Samples were randomly grouped and run with two libraries per sequencing run on three NextSeq High Output 150 cycle reagent kits (Illumina， San Diego， CA)， with 1% PhiX， targeting approximately 200 million reads per sample.

Multiplexed single-cell characterization of alternative polyadenylation regulators (3PRACE),GSE269594,Homo sapiens,Most mammalian genes have multiple polyA sites， representing a substantial source of transcript diversity regulated by the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) machinery. To better understand how these proteins govern polyA site choice we introduce CPA-Perturb-seq， a multiplexed perturbation screen dataset of 42 CPA regulators with a 3â scRNA-seq readout that enables transcriptome-wide inference of polyA site usage. We develop a framework to detect perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of co-regulated polyA sites. We find groups of intronic polyA sites regulated by distinct components of the nuclear RNA life cycle including elongation， splicing， termination， and surveillance. We train and validate a multi-task deep neural network (APARENT-Perturb) for tandem polyA site usage， delineating a cis-regulatory code that predicts perturbation response and reveals interactions between regulatory complexes. Our work highlights the potential for multiplexed single-cell perturbation screens to further our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation.,We conducted a pooled single-cell CRISPR screen (in both HEK293FT and K562 cell lines) targeting 42 genes previously implicated in regulating cleavage and polyadenylation.  We inferred polyA site usage at single-cell resolution from a scRNA-seq readout， and determine how each of these perturbations effects polyA site usage. We validate our polyA site quantifications by performing 3'RACE followed by Illumina sequencing at 7 loci in NT and NUDT21-perturbed cells. We also built a sequence-based deep learning model (APARENT-Perturb) to describe how sequence affects perturbation， and design an MPRA to validate these sequence-based predictions on polyA site usage.,38925112,Cell
Human cytomegalovirus hijacks L1 retrotransposon to fuel its heterogeneity,GSE217152,Homo sapiens,Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes severe morbidity and mortality in an immune-compromised or immune-naÃ¯ve host. Among DNA viruses， the genetic diversity of HCMV is unexpectedly high and comparable to those of RNA viruses， which hinders the development of effective vaccines and causes the emergence of antiviral resistance. However， little is known about how HCMV acquires genetic variation. Here， we propose an evolution strategy of HCMV， that exploits host âjumping DNAâ L1 retrotransposon as a mutagen. We found that HCMV infection switches on L1 expression by upregulating transcription factors YY1 and RUNX3. Furthermore， HCMV DNA processivity factor， UL44 recruits L1 ribonucleoproteins to viral replication compartments and induces DNA damage to its genome. Deep-sequencing analysis of cultured HCMV genome revealed that L1 retrotransposon facilitates mutation burden on the viral genome. Indeed， laboratory adaptation of HCMV to fibroblasts is only observed upon active L1 expression. These findings demonstrate the evolution mechanism and molecular insights of how HCMV acquires genetic fitness by the hijacking of host L1 retrotransposon.,Chromatin accessibility profiling of HCMV-infected and non-infected U373MG cells by ATAC-seq.,39223139,Nat Commun
Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901， a shift from a H2-limited condition to a H2-excess condition,GSE42167,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
Regulated and adaptive in vivo insulin secretion from islets only containing Î²-cells,GSE226479,Mus musculus,The activity of pancreatic isletsâ insulin-producing Î²-cells is closely regulated by systemic cues and， locally， by adjacent islet hormone-producing ânon-Î²-cellsâ (namely Î±-， Î´- and Î³-cells). Still， it is unclear whether the presence of the non-Î²-cells is a requirement for accurate insulin secretion. Here， we generated and studied a mouse model in which adult islets are exclusively composed of Î²-cells， and human pseudoislets containing only primary Î²-cells. Mice lacking non-Î²-cells had optimal blood glucose regulation. They exhibited enhanced glucose tolerance， insulin sensitivity and restricted body weight gain under high-fat diet. The insulin secretion dynamics in islets composed of only Î²-cells was like in intact islets， both in homeostatic conditions and upon extreme insulin demand. Similarly， human Î²-cell pseudoislets retained the glucose-regulated mitochondrial respiration， insulin secretion and exendin-4 responses of human islets comprising all four cell types. Together， the findings indicate that non-Î²-cells are dispensable for blood glucose homeostasis and Î²-cell function. This is particularly relevant in diabetes， where non-Î²-cells become dysfunctional and worsen the diseaseâs pathophysiology. These results support efforts aimed at developing diabetes treatments by generating Î²-like cell clusters devoid of non-Î²-cells， as for example from human embryonic stem cells and/or by in situ conversion of non-Î²-cells into insulin producers.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for FAC-sorted pancreatic beta-cells of control mice with intact islets and DT-treated beta-only mice， both under 2-hour refed or 8-hour fasting conditions.,39169271,Nat Metab
RNA half-life regulation reveals countercyclical regulation of buffered RNAs and RNAs undergoing changes in abundance [trim-Qfilt],GSE278543,Arabidopsis thaliana,mRNA abundances are regulated by the opposing forces of transcription and decay， and yet how decay contributes to mRNA abundance regulation is largely unexplored. We addressed this question using genome-wide data on mRNA rates of abundance change， half-lives， and transcription rates of leaf cells responding to a transdifferentiation stimulusulus.  Half-life regulation was common (22% of mRNAs underwent changes in half-life)， but RNA abundance regulation by decay alone or by decay that supported transcriptional regulation was rare. Instead， most altered RNA half-lives opposed changes in transcription. Oppositionally regulated mRNAs were characterized by large changes in transcription and decay rates yet changes in mRNA abundances were either modest or undetectable， suggestive of RNA buffering.  Oppositionally-regulated and buffered RNAs showed very similar dynamics， suggesting use of a common mechanism. The strongest contributions of RNA decay to RNA abundance regulation was in synergistically regulated transcripts， where rate changes in decay and transcription rates worked together to change RNA abundances.,To investigate rates of RNA abundance change for comparison with RNA decay rates following a stimulusulus response， we preformed a time course experiment of mock and stimulusulus.Detached leaves of 10 d old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were treated with mock conditions or with a transdifferentiation treatment for 5， 6， 7， 8， 9， or 10 h. Tissue was collected for RNA extraction and RNA seq analysis.,nan,

Altered lipid homeostasis underlies selective neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency [1 month],GSE215831,Mus musculus,Spinocerebellar Ataxia Autosomal Recessive 20 (SCAR20) is a rare disorder caused by mutation in the SNX14 gene. The symptoms of the disorder including coarse face， poor or lack of speech， delayed or absent of motor function， and most markedly， cerebella atrophy with Purkinje cell degeneration. SNX14 has been localized to ER and shown to play a vital role in facilitating the formation of lipid droplet and maintaining the lipid saturation balance in cell membrane. Meanwhile， it has also been localized to other subcellular organelles， including lysosome and endo-lysosome， and has been suggested to participate in the autophagy responses. However， the previous researches were performed in vitro or ex vivo， and how disrupted SNX14 led to Purkinje cell degeneration in the SCAR20 cerebella in vivo remained unexplored. Here， we report the first animal model that manifested the SCAR20 symptoms， by introducing a 1bp deletion in Snx14 in mice via CRISPR-Cas9. We performed RNAseq to analyse the pathway changes caused by Snx14 KO.,We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of cerebella and cortices from 2-3 mice of SNX14 KO mice and their control littermates.,38625743,JCI Insight

Environmentally relevant concentrations of individual per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and a PFAS mixture impact proliferation and gene transcription in a human myometrial cell line.,GSE279836,Homo sapiens,Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmental contaminants of concern due to their persistence and potential adverse health effects.  Epidemiological studies have linked PFAS with an increased risk of uterine diseases including fibroids however， the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated.  This study investigated the effects of individual PFAS， including long-chain âlegacyâ PFAS [perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)， perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS)] and short-chain âalternativeâ PFAS compounds [undecafluoro-2-methyl-3-oxahexanoic acid (GENX/HFPO-DA)， perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS)]， as well as a mixture of these chemicals on the function and transcriptome of an immortalized human myometrial cell line (UT-TERT).  UT-TERT cells exposed to individual PFAS displayed increased cell viability and proliferation.  Flow cytometry analysis revealed that PFOS and the PFAS mixture altered cell cycle progression.  Migration assays demonstrated that PFOS and the PFAS mixture significantly enhanced UT-TERT cell migration.  Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) was impaired following PFOA， PFBS， and PFAS mixture exposure， indicating potential disruptions in cell-to-cell communication within the uterine environment.  Transcriptomic analysis using RNA-seq identified substantial changes in gene expression after exposure to environmentally relevant levels of individual PFAS and PFAS mixture.  Pathway analysis revealed common molecular pathways associated with PFAS exposure， including Cell-to-Cell Signaling， Lipid Metabolism， and Cell Death and Survival， while other pathways were unique to specific PFAS.  These findings highlight the multifaceted effects of PFAS on myometrial cells， providing insights into the potential mechanisms underlying PFAS-associated health risks.  Further research is necessary to elucidate the long-term implications of PFAS exposure on uterine function and overall reproductive health.,To determine the impacts of PFAS and PFAS mixture on human mymoetrial cells， cells were treated with various concentraions of individual PFAS and a PFAS mixture and myometrial cell function endpoints were analyzed including cell proliferation， migration/invasion， gap junction activity， and transcriptome.,nan,

Dissecting the Functional Consequences of de Novo DNA Methylation Dynamics in Human Motor Neuron Differentiation and Physiology,GSE90553,Homo sapiens,DNA methylation is a well studied， yet still incompletely understood component of the multi-layered epigenome. The somatic DNA methylation landscape is established early in development， but remains highly dynamic within focal regions that tend to overlap with gene regulatory elements. The functional significance of these dynamic changes remains unresolved. Here we utilized a powerful human ESC differentiation model for the generation of motor neurons (MNs) in combination with genetic mutations in the de novo DNA methylation machinery to dissect the role of DNA methylation in directing somatic cell fate. We quantitatively and in high-resolution measure the molecular and functional consequences of epigenetic perturbation. We find defects in neuralization and MN development. We also observe decreased dendritic arborization and altered electrophysiological properties in DNMT3A KO MNs. Our work provides a specific list of epigenetically deregulated targets and a mechanistic link between de novo DNA methylation， cellular differentiation and human MN function.,We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-Seq on 3 time points during in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards spinal motor neurons at day 0， day 6 and day 14 in three conditions， WT， DNMT3A and DNMT3B knockout backround in 3-5 replicates each. In addition， we also performed  single cell RNA-Seq on the same conditions and time point 6 and 14 as well as bisulfite amplicon sequencing.Please note that raw data is to be made available through dbGaP (controlled access) due to privacy concerns.,29551301,Cell Stem Cell
Adipogenesis， lipolysis， and extracellular matrix remodeling are early modulated by a triterpene-enriched natural extract in a mouse cell line and primary human adipocytes,GSE272831,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Chronic Inflammation has a key role in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Previously， we demonstrated that OBE100， a natural extract from the leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis， has anti-inflammatory properties. Three pentacyclic triterpenoids， ursolic acid， oleanolic acid， and ursolic acid lactone are the major compounds present in OBE100. These molecules have shown multiple biological activities. In this study we analyzed how the compounds of OBE100 modify adipocyte gene expression using RNA sequencing. Triterpenoids regulate the inflammatory program in differentiated adipocytes，  inhibiting the expression of many cytokines， chemokines， and inflammatory mediators. However， the OBE100 extract has a more powerful immunomodulatory effect than the triterpene mixture increasing the number of genes regulated， both in mouse and human models. Our study shows that OBE100 is a promising extract for the treatment of diabetes that can break the link between inflammation and insulin resistance.,3T3-L1(CL-173TM) mouse pre-adipocytes were purchased from ATCC (Manassas， VA， USA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)， 2mM glutamine， 1% penicillin/streptomycin， and 25 mM glucose (Growth Medium 2 â GM2) at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. Differentiation was induced two days postconfluence by adding GM2 containing 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)， 0.25 Î¼M dexamethasone， 2 Î¼M Rosiglitazone， and 1 Î¼g/ml insulin. After two days of incubation， the medium was replaced with GM2 containing 1 Î¼g/ml insulin. Two days later， the medium was replaced by GM2 and incubated for 24 hours with the different treatments. Human primary adipocyte culture was obtained from the abdominal fat of young women. Pre-adipocytes were induced into adipocytes after 100% confluence cultured in a differentiation medium (DMEM 25 mM glucose， 10% FBS， 0.5 mM IBMX， 5 Î¼M dexamethasone， 10 Î¼M insulin， and 2 Î¼M Rosiglitazone) for 7 days. The cells were incubated with DMEM， 25 mM glucose， 10% SFB， and different treatments for another 24 hours.Crude extract OBE100， M1， UA， OA， and UAL were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 25 mg/ml (stock solution). The final concentration of the compounds in the culture medium was OBE100 50 Âµg/ml， M1 39 Âµg/ml (UA+OA+UAL mix)， UA 23.8 Âµg/ml， OA 7 Âµg/ml， and UAL 8.2 Âµg/ml. The concentration used for the three different triterpenes， both in the mixture called M1 and individually， were those determined in the fraction called OBE100. Three independent experiments were performed， each in triplicate.We then performed RNA seq profiling using data obtained from RNA-seq. We compared differentiated adipocytes againts each control (OBE100， M1， UA， OA， UAL) and we also included an adipocyte without fat as control， to verify that the differentation was successfull,nan,
Premature aging effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis: new insights from mouse models,GSE264189,Mus musculus,Aging is identified as a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)， often resulting in profound lung damage and mortality. Yet， the biological relationship between aging， aging-related comorbidities， and COVID-19 remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the age-related COVID19 pathogenesis using a Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) mouse model with humanized ACE2 receptors. Pathological features were compared between young， aged， and HGPS hACE2 mice following SAR-CoV-2 challenge. We demonstrated that young mice display robust interferon response and antiviral activity， whereas this response is attenuated in aged mice. Viral infection in aged mice results in severe respiratory tract bleeding， likely contributing a higher mortality rate. In contrast， HGPS hACE2 mice exhibit milder disease manifestations characterized by minor immune cell infiltration and dysregulation of multiple metabolic processes. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed both shared and unique gene expression dynamics among different mouse groups. Collectively， our studies evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on progeroid syndromes using a HGPS hACE2 mouse model， which holds promise as a valuable tool for investigating COVID-19 pathogenesis in individuals with premature aging.,To investigate the pathological outcomes of lungs in HGPS hACE2 mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection， we infected young (2 month old)， aged (14 month old)， and HGPS (2 month old) hACE2 mice with the original strain of the coronavirus from Wuhan (WIV04) ， and harvest RNA samples of lungs at 1， 3， 5， 7 day-post-infection (dpi).we then performed RNA-seq， and compared the transcriptome changes of lungs between young， old， and HGPS hACE2 mice.,39181932,Sci Rep
Phosphorylation of PABPN1 during mitosis protects mRNA from hyperadenylation and maintains transcriptome dynamics.,GSE247007,Homo sapiens,Polyadenylation controls mRNA biogenesis， nuclear export， translation， and decay. These processes are interdependent and coordinately regulated by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs)， yet how PABPs are themselves regulated is not fully understood. Here， we show that human PABPN1， the nuclear PABP， is phosphorylated by mitotic kinases at four specific sites during mitosis， a time when nucleoplasm and cytoplasm mix. Phospho-inhibitory mutations decreased human cell proliferation. We therefore employed long-read sequencing to determine how PABPN1 phospho-site mutants affected poly(A) tails lengths of individual mRNAs， and TimeLapse-seq to monitor mRNA synthesis and decay. Phospho-inhibitory PABPN1 mutants lengthened poly(A) tails on both spliced and unspliced transcripts. In contrast， expression of phospho-mimetic PABPN1 resulted in shorter poly(A) tails and reduced transcriptome stability， indicating reduced polyadenylation activity of PABPN1 and targeting of long-tailed transcripts for decay. Thus， PABPN1 phosphorylation confers transcriptome instability that is associated with resetting the gene expression program as cells passage through cell cycle.,To investigate the role of PABPN1 phosphorylation in mRNA processing， we constructed HEK293T cell lines with Doxycycline-inducible expression of WT PABPN1， 4SA PABPN1 (S19， S150， S197， and S304 to A)， or 4SD PABPN1 (S19， S150， S197， and S304 to D).,38943343,Nucleic Acids Res
In vivo single-cell CRISPR uncovers distinct TNF-Î± programs in tumor evolution,GSE235325,Mus musculus,The tumor evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes， which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions can remodel entire tissues1-3， the mechanisms behind why only a small number of clones transform into malignant tumors remain enigmatic. Here， we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections， single-cell RNA sequencing and guide capture to longitudinally monitor clonal expansions and document their underlying gene programs at single-cell transcriptomic resolution. We uncover a TNF-Î± signaling module， dependent on TNF receptor 1 and involving macrophages， that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely， during tumorigenesis， the TNF-Î± signaling module is downregulated. Instead， we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF-Î± gene program， associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Finally， we provide in vivo evidence that the autocrine TNF-Î± gene program is sufficient to mediate invasive properties and show that the TNF-Î± signature correlates with shorter overall survival in human squamous cell carcinoma patients. Collectively， our study demonstrates the power of applying in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening to mammalian tissues， unveils distinct TNF-Î± programs in tumor evolution and highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between clonal expansions in epithelia and tumorigenesis.,To longitudinally monitor the function of cancer driver genes， we chose the 150 most frequently altered genes in human head and neck (HNSCC) and skin squamous cell carcinomas (sSCC)， comprising 134 mutated genes and 16 copy number variations (CNVs). We selected 3 sgRNAs per gene and included 50 non-targeting control sgRNAs， resulting in a CROP-seq library of 500 sgRNAs used for high-titer lentivirus production. Lentiviral library was delivered into E9.5 embryos using ultrasound-guided in utero microinjection to infect the single-layered surface ectoderm， resident immune cells and melanoblasts of constitutively Cas9-expressing mouse embryos and introduce loss-of-function mutations in each of the selected cancer genes. At postnatal day 4 (P4) and 60 (P60)， epidermal tissues are collected， sorted for mCherry-positive infected cells， and subjected them to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to assess gene expression profiles and read out the corresponding sgRNA identity (via dial-out PCR).  At P60， chemical carcinogenesis was induced by DMBA/TPA for 12 weeks， then from 30 of thus obtained skin tumors (from 2 animals) single-cell suspensions were sorted for mCherry-positive and negative cells by FACS， and finally sequenced for single-cell transcriptomes. Visium spatial transcriptomics was additionally performed on 4 other DMBA/TPA-induced tumors.,39020166,Nature

Genetic dependencies associated with transcription factor activities in human cancer cell lines [CROP-seq],GSE263747,Homo sapiens,Transcription factors (TFs) are important mediators of aberrant transcriptional programs in cancer cells. In this study， we focused on TF activity (TFa) as a new biomarker for cell line-selective anti-proliferative effects， in that high TFa predicts sensitivity to loss-of-function of a given gene (i.e.， genetic dependencies (GD)). Our linear regression-based framework identified 3，047 pan-cancer and 3，952 cancer-typespecific candidate TFa-GD associations from cell line data， which were then crossexamined for impact on survival in patient cohorts. One of the most prominent biomarkers was TEAD1 activity， whose associations with its predicted GDs were validated through experimental evidence as proof of concept. Overall， these TFa-GD associations represent an attractive resource for identifying innovative， biomarkerdriven hypotheses for drug discovery programs in oncology.,We performed a pooled CRISPRko screen followed by single cell RNA sequencing (CROP-seq) on human SNU-761 cell line using a library containing 450 sgRNAs targeting 108 genes and non-targeting controls.

A Unified Framework for Systematic Identification of Post-Transcriptional Regulatory Modules [ZNF800_ko],GSE274049,Homo sapiens,RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are multifunctional regulators of gene expression with complex and context-dependent mechanisms of action， yet the regulatory grammar that underlies RBP-mediated functions remains underexplored. Here， we performed a multi-omic data integration to systematically decipher the context-specific functions of RBPs. First， we report a compendium of in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) datasets of 50 human RBPs， which we used to generate a large-scale map of RBP protein neighborhoods. In parallel， we took advantage of CRISPR-interference with single-cell RNA-seq read-out (Perturb-seq) to capture rich transcriptomic phenotypes downstream of each RBP knockdown. By combining these physical and functional interaction readouts， along with the ENCODE transcriptome-wide atlas of RBP binding sites from eCLIP assays， we generated an integrated map of functional RBP interactions. This map not only captures well-studied post-transcriptional processes， but also reveals numerous previously unknown RBP-mediated regulatory functions. For a number of these cases， we have validated their predicted context-specific RBP functions using biochemical and genetic approaches. By deciphering these complex modes of functional interactions between RBPs， we have taken the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory processes and their underlying molecular grammar.,We obtained transcriptome-wide gene expression measurements for 68 RBPs (representing a variety of regulatory processes) knockdowns using single-cell RNA sequencing and used the resulting high-dimensional data to systematically delineate genetic interactions between RBPs.  Perturb-seq experiment was performed as previously described (Datlinger et al. 2017).,nan,
Temporal recording of mammalian development and precancer,GSE235119,Mus musculus,Insights into many biological phenomena requires knowing the temporal order of cellular events， which is traditionally achieved through continuous direct observations [1， 2]. An alternative solution leverages irreversible genetic changes， such as naturally occurring mutations， to create indelible markers that enables retrospective temporal ordering [3-8]. Using Native sgRNA Capture and sequencing (NSC-seq)， a newly devised and validated multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform， we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo while incorporating cell state and lineage information. Using this approach， we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during murine embryonic development， unconventional developmental relationships between cell types， and new epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. NSC-seq analysis of murine adenomas coupled to multi-omic and single-cell profiling of human precancers， with clonal analysis of 418 human polyps， demonstrated the occurrence of polyancestral initiation in 15-30% of colonic precancers， revealing their origins from multiple normal founders. Our study presents a multimodal framework that lays the foundation for in vivo recording， integrating synthetic or natural indelible genetic changes with single-cell analyses to explore the origins and timing of development and tumorigenesis in mammalian systems.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual Series,nan,
Quantitative analysis of cis-regulatory elements in transcription with KAS-ATAC-seq [Mouse KAS-ATAC-seq],GSE256231,Mus musculus,Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression throughout diverse biological systems. Accurate identification and in-depth characterization of functional CREs are crucial for decoding gene regulation network and dynamics during cellular processes. In this study， we developed a new KAS-seq (Opti-KAS-seq) procedure， with enhanced efficiency of capturing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)， broader genomic coverage， and adaptability to various sample types. By integrating the highly sensitive Opti-KAS-seq with ATAC-seq， we further introduce KAS-ATAC-seq， a new method that provides quantitative insights into transcriptional activity of CREs. A main advantage of KAS-ATAC-seq lies in its precise measurement of ssDNA levels within both proximal and distal ATAC-seq peaks. This feature is particularly adept at identifying ssDNA promoter and Single-Stranded Transcribing Enhancers (SSTEs). SSTEs are highly enriched with nascent RNA transcripts and specific transcription factors (TFs) binding sites that determine cellular identity. Moreover， KAS-ATAC-seq provides a detailed characterization and functional implications of various SSTE subtypes; KAS-ATAC-seq signals exhibit more robust correlation with enhancer activities when compared with ATAC-seq data and active histone mark profiles. Our analysis of promoters and SSTEs during mouse neural differentiation demonstrates that KAS-ATAC-seq can effectively identify immediate-early activated CREs in response to RA treatment. We further discovered that ETS TFs and YY1 are critical in initiating early neural differentiation from mESCs to NPCs. Our findings indicate that KAS-ATAC-seq provides more precise annotation of functional CREs in transcription. Future applications of KAS-ATAC-seq would help elucidate the intricate dynamics of gene regulation in diverse biological processes and biomedical applications.,We developed a new KAS-seq procedure， Opti-KAS-seq， with enhanced efficiency of capturing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)， broader genomic coverage， and adaptability to various sample types.

RNA-Seq to decipher breast cancer-adipocytes reciprocal reprogramming: evaluating the impact of glucose,GSE243555,Homo sapiens,The tumor microenvironment， including adipocytes， is a critical element for breast cancer (BC) progression， also responding to metabolic stimuli characterizing obesity and/or diabetes. The reciprocal reprogramming established between BC cells and adipocytes remains to be deciphered. We investigated (i) the effect  of mammary adipocytes on BC cells and vice versa，  (ii) the impact  of glucose on BC cells， adipocytes and (iii) the impact of glucose on their cross-talk. We have identified adipocyte-modulated genes in BC cells and BC cell-modulated genes in adipocytes， dependently and independently of glucose levels. We identified the adipogenesis process as the most relevantly differentially regulated pathway both in cancer cells and in adipocytes upon exposure to high glucose concentration. Specifically， we observed that BC cells promote de-differentiation of adipocytes and re-shaping toward a fibroblast-like phenotype， particularly upon glucose lowering; the de-lipidation of adipocytes is paralleled by induction of adipogenesis genes in BC cells.,To this end， we used a co-culture system in which mammary adipocytes and MCF7 BC cells were separated by an insert to allow the diffusion of soluble factors. Through RNA-Sequencing， the transcriptome of both cell types was determined， in co-cultures as well as a mono-cultures， while exposed to glucose concentrations resembling hyperglycemia or normoglycemia in humans.  We obtained evidence that adipocytes and BC cells reciprocally modify their transcriptome.,39433816,Sci Rep
Sodium chloride in the tumor microenvironment enhances T cell metabolic fitness and cytotoxicity,GSE232149,Homo sapiens,The efficacy of antitumor immunity is associated with the metabolic state of cytotoxic T cells， which is highly amenable to perturbation by the tumor microenvironment. It is therefore of tremendous interest to bypass immunosuppressive signaling in the tumor microenvironment and to identify factors that augment T cell immunometabolism， cytotoxic effector functions and eventually tumor killing. Whether ionic signals serve as aberrant immune signals and influence the adaptive human antitumor immune response is still largely unexplored. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of sodium in solid tumors of breast cancer patients， which leaves a transcriptomic imprint on intratumoral immune cells. Sodium chloride (NaCl) enhanced the activation state and effector functions of human CD8+ memory T cells. These functional alterations were associated with improved metabolic fitness， in particular with an increase in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and overall nutrient uptake. These NaCl-induced effects translated into increased tumor cell killing in vitro and in a tumor mouse model in vivo.

The SAGA complex maintains the oncogenic gene expression program in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma [ATAC-Seq],GSE211954,Homo sapiens,Pediatric cancers are frequently driven by fusion or amplification events that result in aberrant transcription factor activity.  As transcription factors themselves remain challenging to target， an emerging therapeutic approach for these cancers is to target epigenetic complexes that help maintain oncogenic transcriptional programs. It is therefore critical to identify the complete set of epigenetic modulators maintaining the oncogenic epigenetic landscape of pediatric cancers. Here， we used functional genomic screens to identify epigenetic complexes critical for viability in cell line models of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma， a disease of dysregulated development driven by an aberrant oncogenic transcriptional program. We identified multiple genes within the transcriptional coactivator Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex as selective dependencies in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Integrating ChIP-seq， ATAC-seq， and RNA-seq with targeted protein-degradation and gene editing tools， we characterized the DNA recruitment sites of the SAGA complex in neuroblastoma， and the consequences of SAGA complex lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity loss on histone acetylation and gene expression. We demonstrate that loss of SAGA KAT activity suppresses MYC and MYCN gene expression programs and impairs cell cycle progression. Further， we showed that the SAGA complex is pharmacologically targetable with a KAT2A/KAT2B proteolysis targeting chimera molecule that demonstrated significant activity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings expand our understanding of the histone-modifying complexes that maintain the oncogenic transcriptional state in this disease and suggest therapeutic potential for inhibitors of SAGA KAT activity in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.,Investigate chromatin opening in the KELLY neuroblastoma cell line.

FoxO transcription factors actuate the formative pluripotency specific gene expression programme [ChIP-Seq],GSE253479,Mus musculus,NaÃ¯ve pluripotency is sustained by a self-reinforcing gene regulatory network (GRN) comprising core and naÃ¯ve pluripotency-specific transcription factors (TFs). Upon exiting naÃ¯ve pluripotency， ES cells transition through a formative post-implantation-like pluripotent state. However， the mechanisms underlying disengagement from the naÃ¯ve GRN and initiation of the formative GRN remain unclear. Here， we demonstrate that phosphorylated AKT acts as a gatekeeper that prevents nuclear localization of FoxO TFs in naÃ¯ve ESCs. PTEN-mediated reduction of AKT activity allows nuclear entry by FoxO TFs， enforcing a cell fate transition by binding and activating formative pluripotency-specific enhancers. Indeed， FoxO TFs are necessary and sufficient for transition from the naÃ¯ve to the formative pluripotent state. Our work uncovers a pivotal role for FoxO TFs and AKT signalling in mechanisms underlying the exit from naÃ¯ve pluripotency， a critical early embryonic cell fate transition.,Chromatine-immunoprecipitation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) for FoxO1 and FoxO3 in WT and Pten KO mESC， in pluripotency supporting conditions (2i) and 24hours after 2i withdrawal (N24).,39251582,Nat Commun
USP50 suppresses alternative RecQ helicase use and deleterious DNA2 activity during replication,GSE269605,Homo sapiens,Mammalian DNA replication relies on various DNA helicases and nuclease activities to ensure accurate genetic duplication， but how different helicase and nuclease activities are properly directed remains unclear. Here， we identify the ubiquitin-specific protease， USP50， as a chromatin-associated protein required to promote ongoing replication， fork restart， telomere maintenance， cellular survival following hydroxyurea or pyridostatin treatment， and suppression of DNA breaks near GC-rich sequences. We find that USP50 supports proper WRN: FEN1 localisation at or near stalled replication forks. Nascent DNA in cells lacking USP50 shows increased association of the DNA2 nuclease and RECQL4 and RECQL5 helicases and replication defects in cells lacking USP50， or FEN1 are driven by these proteins. Consequently， suppression of DNA2 or RECQL4/5 improves USP50-depleted cell resistance to agents inducing replicative stress and restores telomere stability. These data define an unexpected regulatory protein that promotes the balance of helicase and nuclease use at ongoing and stalled replication forks..,INDUCE-Seq and Illumina sequencing on DNA samples from Hela cells treated for three days with either control siRNA or USP50 siRNA,39284827,Nat Commun
Elucidating and Pharmacologically Targeting Master Regulators of Stem-like Breast Cancer Cell State (CROP-Seq),GSE241115,Homo sapiens,In many tumors， small subpopulations of stem-like cells can exist in drug-resistant states that are transient and epigenetically governed. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides transcriptional profiles for individual cells which， although sparse and noisy， may provide insight into how they are regulated and how they may be targeted. We took a systems-biology approach to analyzing cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in breast tumors and predicting Master Regulator (MR) proteins responsible for governing the transcriptional state of these cells， thus revealing drug sensitivities that may be leveraged via combination therapy. The MRs were validated by pooled， CRISPR-KO mediated CROP-seq profiling of single cells representing either the CLSC or the differentiated breast cancer (BRCA) cells.,For control samples， the four breast cancer cell lines (MCF7， HCC2157， HCC38， and HCC1143) were incubated， dissociated， and subjected to scRNA-seq (10X Genomics).For the CROPSeq screening， total 50 genes， identified as top 25 activated proteins in breast CSLCs and top 25 activated proteins in well-differentiated BRCA cells， were targeted with 3 sgRNAs/gene for HCC1143 and HCC38 cells. In addition， 15 intergenic sgRNAs experiments were included a negative controls. Cells were grown for 14 days of post sgRNA transduction before the scRNAseq (10X Genomics).,38798673,bioRxiv
Obesity study in transgenic and knockout animals,GSE12000,Mus musculus,A major task in dissecting the genetics of complex traits is to identify causal genes for disease phenotypes.  We previously developed a method to infer causal relationships among genes through the integration of DNA variation， gene transcription， and phenotypic information.  Here we validated our method through the characterization of transgenic and knockout mouse models of candidate genes that were predicted to be causal for abdominal obesity.  Perturbation of eight out of the nine genes， with Gas7， Me1 and Gpx3 being novel， resulted in significant changes in obesity related traits.  Liver expression signatures revealed alterations in common metabolic pathways and networks contributing to abdominal obesity and overlapped with a macrophage-enriched metabolic network module that is highly associated with metabolic traits in mice and humans.  Integration of gene expression in the design and analysis of traditional F2 intercross studies allows high confidence prediction of causal genes， and identification of involved pathways and networks.This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.,Refer to individual Series,19270708,Nat Genet
Transcriptional and methylation outcomes of didehydro-Cortistatin A use in HIV-1 infected CD4+T cells,GSE272666,Homo sapiens,Ongoing viral transcription from the reservoir of long-lived CD4+ T cells containing integrated HIV-1 DNA presents a barrier to cure and associates with poorer health outcomes for people living with HIV， including chronic immune activation and inflammation. We previously reported that didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA)， an HIV-1 Tat inhibitor， blocks HIV-1 transcription. We sought to extend this work and examine the impact of dCA on host immune CD4+ T cell transcriptional and epigenetic states. Here， we performed a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide transcriptomic and DNA methylation profiles upon long-term dCA-treatment of primary human memory CD4+ T cells. dCA prompted specific transcriptional and DNA methylation changes in cell cycle， histone， interferon-response and T cell lineage transcription factor genes， through inhibition of both HIV-1 and Mediator kinases. These alterations establish a tolerogenic Treg/Th2 phenotype， reducing viral gene expression and mitigating inflammation in primary CD4+T cells during HIV-1 infection. Additionally， dCA suppresses expression of lineage-defining transcription factors for Th17 and Th1 cells， critical HIV-1 targets and reservoirs. dCAâs benefits thus extend beyond viral transcription inhibition， modulating immune cell landscape to limit HIV-1 acquisition and inflammatory environment linked to HIV-infection.â,A comparative RNA-seq analysis of primary memory CD4+ T cells treated with ART or ART + 50 nm didehydro-Cortistatin A for 5 weeks. Memory CD4+ T cells in the Kessing Study were isolated from people living with HIV and expanded and treated in vitro. Memory CD4+ T cells in the Mori study were isolated from people not living with HIV and expanded， treated and infected with HIV in vitro (or left uninfected). We compared cells treated with dCA versus those untreated and sought to distinguish the effects of dCA in HIV-infected cells versus the effects of dCA in uninfected cells.,39089880,Life Sci Alliance

FoxO transcription factors actuate the formative pluripotency specific gene expression programme [ATAC-Seq],GSE253472,Mus musculus,NaÃ¯ve pluripotency is sustained by a self-reinforcing gene regulatory network (GRN) comprising core and naÃ¯ve pluripotency-specific transcription factors (TFs).

Centralized control of dynamic gene regulatory circuits governs human T cell rest and activation [Bulk_RNA],GSE276096,Homo sapiens,The ability of individual cells to maintain a distinct identity and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks. However， how discrete sets of gene regulators coordinate circuits that respond to extracellular cues remains poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in human CD4+ T cells， where distinct cell lineages must respond to diverse signals to orchestrate effective adaptive immune responses and maintain homeostasis. Here， we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL2RA， which is a canonical marker of T cell activation in pro-inflammatory effector T cells (Teffs) and constitutively expressed in anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) where it is required for fitness. Strikingly， the majority of identified regulators are required in discrete cell type and stimulation timepoints， and a subset even had opposite functional effects in different conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits， we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. Upstream of these networks， MED12 â a component of the Mediator complex â serves as a dynamic orchestrator of regulators across conditions， governing both cell type- and stimulation-specific gene expression. MED12 interacts with the histone modifying complex COMPASS， affecting chromatin state and expression of genes encoding key context- and lineage-specific regulators; including rest maintenance factor KLF2 and activation promoting genes. We demonstrated that CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted this cell state transition and protected T cells from activation-induced cell death. Overall， this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across primary cell conditions to identify context-specific regulators and dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.,Bulk RNAseq performed on resting and stimulated CD4+ Tregs and Teffs following arrayed CRISPR KO of Mediator complex subunits.,39663454,Nature
Specific pre-plasma cell states and local proliferation at the dark zone â medulla interface characterize germinal center-derived plasma cell differentiation in lymph node (Figure2) II,GSE275122,Mus musculus,High affinity antibody-producing plasma cell (PC) production in germinal centers (GC) is crucial for antibody-mediated immune protection after vaccination or infection. The selection of high affinity B cells in the GC light zone instructs PC differentiation in a subset of cells， but the phenotype， differentiation trajectory and spatial localization of those prePC intermediates remain to be characterized. Here， we have used a mouse model to track GC-derived B cells with integrative single-cell and spatial analyses in draining lymph node after immunization. We first identified putative prePC in scRNA-seq datasets， then enriched those cells through their specific surface phenotype for further analysis of their gene expression trajectories and BCR repertoire. We found a continuum of actively proliferating transitional states bridging selected LZ GC B cells and recently exported PCs， with gradually increasing levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated genes and immunoglobulin transcripts. Spatial analyses revealed that recently differentiated PC continued their maturation and proliferation at the interface between the DZ and extensions of the lymph node medulla. Our results provide insights into the intermediate stages and microenvironmental factors involved in the differentiation of GC B cells into PC， with implications for vaccine development and understanding antibody responses.,Mice were primed with NP-KLH in Sigma Adjuvant System， and we investigated cells 5 days after tamoxifen gavage， at day 16 of the primary response， using droplet-based 5â-end scRNA-seq. For experiments described in Figure 2a， cells from draining lymph nodes were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 5% FCS and 2 mM EDTA) at a concentration of 10E8 cells/ml. Samples from different mice and different time points were processed separately using cell hashing as described (DOI : 10.1038/s41592-019-0392-0). Cells were individually stained with distinct barcoded anti-mouse CD45 antibodies (in-house conjugated) in FACS buffer for 30 minutes on ice. Subsequently， cells were washed and stained with a mix of primary antibodies， then Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Thermofisher). Live cells of interest (IgDneg eYFP+ PC and B cells) from each sample were bulk-sorted using a BD Influx cell sorter. PC and non-PC were captured in distinct wells for droplet-based scRNA-seq to maximize the recovery of BCR sequence information from non-PC. Within each fraction， cells from different samples were pooled and loaded for the 10x Genomics Single Cell 5' v2 workflow. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications for generating B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing libraries. Following cDNA amplification， SPRI select beads were used to separate the large cDNA fraction derived from cellular mRNAs (retained on beads) from the hashtag oligonucleotide (HTO)-containing fraction (in supernatant). For the mRNA-derived cDNA fraction， 50 ng were used to generate the transcriptome library， and 10-20 ng were used for BCR library construction. Gene expression libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. For BCR libraries， heavy and light chain cDNAs were amplified by two rounds of PCR (6 cycles + 8 cycles) using external 12  primers recommended by 10x Genomics. Approximately 800 pg of purified amplified cDNA was tagmented using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) and amplified for 12 cycles using the SI-PCR forward primer (10x Genomics) and a Nextera i7 reverse primer (Illumina). For the HTO-containing fraction， 5 ng were used to generate the HTO library. The resulting libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform with single-indexed paired-end kits following the manufacturerâs guidelines.,nan,
RNA half-life regulation reveals countercyclical regulation of buffered RNAs and RNAs undergoing changes in abundance,GSE278544,Arabidopsis thaliana,mRNA abundances are regulated by the opposing forces of transcription and decay， and yet how decay contributes to mRNA abundance regulation is largely unexplored. We addressed this question using genome-wide data on mRNA rates of abundance change， half-lives， and transcription rates of leaf cells responding to a transdifferentiation stimulusulus.  Half-life regulation was common (22% of mRNAs underwent changes in half-life)， but RNA abundance regulation by decay alone or by decay that supported transcriptional regulation was rare. Instead， most altered RNA half-lives opposed changes in transcription. Oppositionally regulated mRNAs were characterized by large changes in transcription and decay rates yet changes in mRNA abundances were either modest or undetectable， suggestive of RNA buffering.  Oppositionally-regulated and buffered RNAs showed very similar dynamics， suggesting use of a common mechanism. The strongest contributions of RNA decay to RNA abundance regulation was in synergistically regulated transcripts， where rate changes in decay and transcription rates worked together to change RNA abundances.,To investigate RNA decay rates following a stimulusulus response， we analyzed RNA abundance after 8 h stimulus and calcualted the decay rates from RNA abundances after 15， 60， and 240 min transcription inhibition by 1 mM cordycepin.Detached leaves of 10 d old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were treated with mock conditions or with a transdifferentiation treatment for 5， 6， 7， 8， 9， or 10 h.

Multiplexed single-cell characterization of alternative polyadenylation regulators (scRNA-Seq),GSE269596,Homo sapiens,Most mammalian genes have multiple polyA sites， representing a substantial source of transcript diversity regulated by the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) machinery. To better understand how these proteins govern polyA site choice we introduce CPA-Perturb-seq， a multiplexed perturbation screen dataset of 42 CPA regulators with a 3â scRNA-seq readout that enables transcriptome-wide inference of polyA site usage. We develop a framework to detect perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of co-regulated polyA sites. We find groups of intronic polyA sites regulated by distinct components of the nuclear RNA life cycle including elongation， splicing， termination， and surveillance. We train and validate a multi-task deep neural network (APARENT-Perturb) for tandem polyA site usage， delineating a cis-regulatory code that predicts perturbation response and reveals interactions between regulatory complexes. Our work highlights the potential for multiplexed single-cell perturbation screens to further our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation.,We conducted a pooled single-cell CRISPR screen (in both HEK293FT and K562 cell lines) targeting 42 genes previously implicated in regulating cleavage and polyadenylation.  We inferred polyA site usage at single-cell resolution from a scRNA-seq readout， and determine how each of these perturbations effects polyA site usage. We validate our polyA site quantifications by performing 3'RACE followed by Illumina sequencing at 7 loci in NT and NUDT21-perturbed cells. We also built a sequence-based deep learning model (APARENT-Perturb) to describe how sequence affects perturbation， and design an MPRA to validate these sequence-based predictions on polyA site usage.,38925112,Cell
Characterization of HBV and co-infection with HDV and HIV through spatial transcriptomics,GSE265785,Homo sapiens,Background and aims: The intrahepatic processes associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)， especially in the context of HDV and HIV co-infection， require a better understanding. Spatial transcriptomics can provide new insights into the complex intrahepatic biological processes， guiding new personalized treatments. Our aim is to evaluate this method to characterize the hepatic transcriptional landscape， cellular composition and biological pathways in liver biopsy samples from patients infected with HBV and HDV or HIV co-infection.   Method: The GeoMx nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) platform was employed to assess expression of HBsAg and CD45 in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies from three treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with chronic HBV and HDV or HIV co-infection. The GeoMx whole transcriptome human atlas assay quantified the expression of genes enriched in specific regions of interest (ROIs). Cell type proportions within ROIs were deconvoluted using a training matrix from the human liver cell atlas. A weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) evaluated transcriptomic signatures across sampled regions.  Results: We identified spatially discrete transcriptomic signatures and distinct biological pathways that associate with HBV infection/disease status and immune responses. Shared features including cytotoxicity and B cell receptor signaling were consistent across patients， suggesting common elements alongside individual traits. HDV/HBV co-infection exhibited upregulated genes linked to apoptosis and immune cell recruitment， whereas HIV/HBV co-infection featured genes related to interferon response regulation. Varied cellular characteristics and immune cell populations， with an abundance of ï§ï¤T cells in the HDV/HBV sample， were observed within analyzed regions. Transcriptional differences in hepatocyte function suggest disrupted metabolic processes in HDV/HBV co-infection potentially impacting disease progression.     Conclusion: This proof-of-principle study shows the value of this platform in investigating the complex immune landscape highlighting relevant host pathways to disease pathogenesis.,Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver biopsies from three patients with chronic HBV (PT1)， one with HDV/HBV co-infection (PT2) and one patient with HIV/HBV (PT3) co-infection were analyzed in this study. Participants were recruited at The Royal London Hospital， Barts Health NHS Trust and samples were obtained during routine diagnostic procedures following written informed consent. Slides were submitted for Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) and whole transcriptome sequencing， according to the manufacturerâs recommendations for GeoMx-NGS RNA BOND RX slide preparation (manual no.

Here， we analyze the spatiotemporal kinetics of microglial aging in the hippocampus. Spatially， the dynamics of age-related inflammatory changes in microglia vastly differ across adjoining regions.

Cell state transitions are decoupled from cell division during early embryo development [I],GSE269784,Danio rerio,As tissues develop， cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation， we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. However， in the absence of cell division， differentiation slows down in some cell types， and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division， the proportions of cells across cell states are not but show evidence of partial compensation. This work clarifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.,"We arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos at 6 hours post fertilization (hpf) using two independent approaches: a chemical approach (hydroxyurea and aphidicolin， HUA) and a genetic approach involving a loss-of-function mutation in the gene emi1 (allele hi2648). We tracked differentiation dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on embryos spanning 6â24 hpf for HUA-treated and control embryos， and at 24 hpf for emi1 mutant embryos. Overall we have collected multiple replicates for control embryos (ABs) at 6， 8， 10， 14， 18， 21 and 24 hpf， for HUA treated at 8， 10， 14 and 24 hpf and for emi1 mutants at 24 hpf.

Pooled CRISPR screens with joint single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome profiling [CUT&RUN],GSE278910,Homo sapiens,MultiPerturb-seq is a high-throughput CRISPR screening platform with joint single nucleus chromatin accessibility， transcriptome， and guide RNA capture. It uses combinatorial indexing combined with droplet microfluidics to scale throughput and integrate all three modalities.

Genome-wide interference of chromatin architecture and Mediator in transcriptional bursting and gene network regulation,GSE241338,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Gene expression is a stochastic process that occurs in bursts of RNA synthesis. We applied a mathematical model to scRNA-Seq data to infer bursting dynamics transcriptome-wide under multiple perturbations in a wide range of cell types and identified possible molecular mechanisms. We find that mediator complex subunit MED26 primarily regulates frequency， MYC regulates burst size， while cohesin and super-enhancers can modulate both. Despite comparable effect sizes on RNA levels amongst these perturbations， we find that acute depletion of MED26 plays a larger role in perturbing gene regulatory networks. Furthermore， this perturbation acts downstream of both chromatin spatial architecture and preinitiation complex formation， indicating that later steps in the initiation of transcriptional bursts are primary nodes for integrating gene networks in single cells.,scRNAseq， ChIPseq. mRNAseq， PROseq,39121214,Sci Adv

Targeting axonal guidance dependencies in glioblastoma with ROBO1 CAR T cells,GSE240490,Homo sapiens,Resistance to genotoxic therapies and tumor recurrence are hallmarks of glioblastoma (GBM)， an aggressive brain tumor. Here， we explore functional drivers of post-treatment recurrent GBM. By conducting genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in patient-derived GBM models， we uncover distinct genetic dependencies in recurrent tumor cells absent in their patient-matched primary predecessors， accompanied by increased mutational burden and differential transcript and protein expression. These analyses map a multilayered genetic response to drive tumor recurrence， identifying protein tyrosine phosphatase 4A2 (PTP4A2) as a novel modulator of self-renewal， proliferation and tumorigenicity at GBM recurrence. Genetic perturbation or small molecule inhibition of PTP4A2 activity represses axon guidance activity through a dephosphorylation axis with roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1)， exploiting a functional dependency on ROBO signaling. Importantly， engineered anti-ROBO1 single-domain antibodies mimic effects of PTP4A2 inhibition. Since a pan-PTP4A inhibitor was limited by poor penetrance across the blood brain barrier (BBB) in vivo， a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy was engineered against ROBO1 that elicits specific and potent anti-tumor responses in vivo. A single dose of anti-ROBO1 CAR-T cells doubles median survival in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of recurrent glioblastoma， and also eradicates tumors in ~50% of mice in PDX models of adult lung-to-brain metastases and pediatric relapsed medulloblastoma. We conclude that functional reprogramming drives tumorigenicity and dependence on a multi-targetable PTP4A-ROBO1 signaling axis at GBM recurrence， with potential in other malignant brain tumors.,Gene expression profiling was performed in triplicate by RNA sequencing in cell lines derived from primary and recurrent glioblastoma.  Along with the baseline expression， differential expression was determined after transduction with CRISPR sgRNAs targeting the AAVS1 locus or two individual guides targeting the PTP4A2 gene.,39095594,Nat Med

We examined sex and race differences in human pancreatic islets from 15 donors using an orthogonal series of experiments including single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)， single nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq)， dynamic hormone secretion， and bioenergetics.,Human islets (500 IEQ per condition) were cultured overnight in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37Â°C. Islet cells were then dispersed using TrypLE (Thermofischer)， and immediately evaluated for viability (90.61Â±3.04%) by Cellometer Automated Cell Counter (Nexcelom Bioscience) prior to single nuclei ATAC library preparation. Nuclei were isolated based on the 10X genomics Nuclei isolation protocol (CG00169 Rev D) with some modifications. We observe that the usage of 0.5ml tubes yields superior nuclei collection. Furthermore， we optimize based on a sample-to-sample basis the time for cell lysis (3-5min). The final lysis buffer concentration for Nonidet P40 was 0.15% over the 0.1% recommendation. Finally， in addition to the final wash with wash buffer， we perform a final wash with the 10X Genomics Nuclei Buffer (PN-2000153/2000207). Nuclei are always kept < 0Â°C， visually inspected for integrity and quality using a viability dye， prior to library prep which was performed within 30min. Briefly， 5，000-6，500 isolated nuclei were incubated with a transposition mix to preferentially fragment and tag the DNA in open regions of the chromatin. The transposed nuclei were then partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-emulsions (GEMs) with barcoded gel beads， a master mix， and partition oil on a chromium chip H. Upon GEM formation and PCR， 10x barcoded DNA fragments were generated with an Illumina P5 sequence， a 16nt 10x barcode， and a read 1 sequence. Following library construction， sequencing-ready libraries were generated with addition of P7， a sample index， and a read 2 sequence. Quality controls of these resulting single cell ATAC libraries were performed by using Agilent High Sensitive DNA kit with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantified by Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (ThermoFisher). Pooled libraries at a final concentration of 750pM were sequenced with paired-end dual indexing configuration by Illumina NextSeq 2000 (Illumina) to achieve 40，000-30，000 read pairs per nucleus.,39567827,EMBO J

Global organelle profiling reveals subcellular localization and remodeling at proteome scale,GSE278059,Homo sapiens;Human coronavirus OC43,Defining the subcellular distribution of all human proteins and its remodeling across cellular states remains a central goal in cell biology. Here， we present a high-resolution strategy to map subcellular organization using organelle immuno-capture coupled to mass spectrometry. We apply this workflow to a cell-wide collection of membranous and membrane-less compartments. A graph-based analysis reveals the subcellular localization of over 7，600 proteins， defines spatial networks， and uncovers interconnections between cellular compartments. Our approach can be deployed to comprehensively profile proteome remodeling during cellular perturbation. By characterizing the cellular landscape following hCoV-OC43 viral infection， we discover that many proteins are regulated by changes in their spatial distribution rather than by changes in abundance. Our results establish that proteome-wide analysis of subcellular remodeling provides unique insights for the elucidation of cellular responses， uncovering an essential role for ferroptosis in OC43 infection. Our dataset can be explored at organelles.czbiohub.org.,HEK293T cells were infected with hCoV-OC43 for 16， 24， and 48 hours at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0， and subjected to single-cell transcriptomics processing on the 10x Genomics platform， along with uninfected control cells.

Analysis of deregulated genes upon Septin9 depletion in C2C12 and primary isolated myoblasts,GSE272316,Mus musculus,Controlled myogenic differentiation is integral to the development， maintenance and repair of skeletal muscle， necessitating precise regulation of myogenic progenitors and resident stem cells. The transformation of proliferative muscle progenitors into multinuclear syncytia involves intricate cellular processes driven by cytoskeletal reorganization. While actin and microtubles have been extensively studied， we illuminate the role of septins， an essential yet still often overlooked cytoskeletal component， in myoblast architecture. Notably， Septin9 emerges as a critical regulator of myoblast differentiation during the initial commitment phase. Knock-down of Septin9 in C2C12 cells and primary mouse myoblasts accelerates the transition from proliferation to committed progenitor transcriptional programs. Furthermore， we unveil significant reorganization and downregulation of Septin9 during myogenic differentiation. Collectively， we propose that filmamentous septin structures and their orchestrated reorganization in myoblasts are part of a temporal regulatory mechanism governing the differentiation of myogenic progenitors. This study sheds light on the dynamic interplay between cytoskeletal components underlying controlled myogenic differentiation.,Bulk RNA-seq of C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts was performed in duplicates for a total of 2 conditions (4 C2C12 samples and 4 primary myoblast samples). C2C12 and primary myoblasts were subjected to Septin9 siRNA treatment and non-targeting siRNA was used as a control. C2C12 cells were myogenically differentiatied for 12 hours thorugh serum deprivation (sample collection 60 hours after Septin9 depletion) and primary myoblasts were cultured under proliferatve conditions (sample collection 48 hours after Septin9 depletion).,39246450,iScience

Plant mRNAs move into a fungal pathogen via extracellular vesicles to reduce infection,GSE197077,Arabidopsis thaliana;Botrytis cinerea,By using RNA-seq analysis on purified extracellular vesicles from the infected tissue， we found that host plant Arabidopsis thaliana secretes a panel of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in extracellular vesicles. These mobile plant mRNAs were delivered into cells of the interacting fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. While using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) profiling and polysome analysis， we observed that the delivered host mRNAs were associated with active fungal polysomes isolated from the infected tissue， suggesting that they are translated in the fungal cells.,Detection of cross-kingdom mRNA trafficking between the plant host and the fungal pathogen.,nan,
Ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-seq) in Huh7 control and SMYD5 KO cells upon normal condition or Torin1 treatment,GSE241588,Homo sapiens,To understand how RPL40 K22me3 transferred by SMYD5 affected ribosome function on normal culture condition or after mTOR inhibition， we conducted ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-seq)  in Huh7 control (NC) and SMYD5 KO cells.,Huh7 control (NC) and SMYD5 KO cells were culturedHuh7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S or treated by 50 nM Torin1 for 12 hrs before collecting.

LAP2alpha facilitates myogenic gene expression by preventing spreading of nucleoplasmic lamin A/C to active chromatin regions (RNA-Seq),GSE247773,Mus musculus,A-type lamins form a filamentous meshwork beneath the nuclear membrane that anchors large heterochromatic chromatin domains at the nuclear envelope. They also exist as a more dynamic， non-filamentous pool in the nuclear interior， where they interact with gene-rich euchromatin. Lamin-associated polypeptide 2 alpha (LAP2alpha) binds to and maintains the nucleoplasmic lamin pool， but the functional significance of this interaction is poorly understood. Here we investigate the genome-wide chromatin association of A-type lamins during myogenic differentiation in the presence and absence of LAP2alpha.  We find that A-type lamins are significantly reorganized on chromatin upon depletion of LAP2alpha， spreading towards active chromatin and accumulating at regions of active H3K27ac and H3K4me3 histone marks close to the genes whose expression is impaired in the absence of LAP2alpha. This reorganization of A-type lamins on chromatin is accompanied by depletion of the active chromatin mark H3K27ac and a significant delay of myogenic differentiation. Thus， the interplay of lamins and LAP2alpha is crucial for proper positioning of intranuclear lamins on chromatin to allow normal myogenic differentiation.This research was funded in whole or in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) to Roland Foisner:P32512-B/DOI:10.55776/P36503https://www.doi.org/10.55776/P36503P36503-B/DOI:10.55776/P32512https://www.doi.org/10.55776/P32512,Gene expression profiling by RNA-sequencing of proliferating (Prol) and differentiating wildtype and LAP2alpha knockout immortalized myoblasts (D0: start of differentiation; D2: day 2 after induction of differentiation).

A highly sensitive and robust method for genome-wide 5hmC profiling of rare cell populations,GSE77967,Mus musculus,Investigations of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in biologically and clinically samples and models with low cell numbers have been hampered by the low sensitivity and reproducibility using current 5hmC mapping approaches. Here， we develop a selective 5hmC chemical labeling approach using tagmentation-based library preparation in order to profile nanogram levels of 5hmC isolated from ~1，000 cells (nano-hmC-Seal). Using this technology， we profiled the dynamics of 5hmC across different stages of mouse hematopoietic differentiation. Additionally， applying nano-hmC-Seal to the hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse model， we identified leukemia-specific， differentially hydroxymethylated regions that harbor previously reported and as-yet-unidentified functionally relevant factors. The change of 5hmC patterns in AML strongly correlates with the altered gene expression on a global scale. Together， our new approach offers a highly sensitive and robust method to study and detect DNA methylation dynamics from in vivo model and clinical samples.,Selective 5hmC chemical labeling approach using tagmentation-based library preparation in order to profile nanogram levels of 5hmC isolated from ~1，000 cells,27477909,Mol Cell
The Role and Mechanism of TEAD4 in Preimplantation Embryonic Development in Mice and Cattle,GSE237418,Bos taurus;Mus musculus,Tead4 is a critical transcription factor expressed during preimplantation development and is essential for the expression of trophectoderm-specific genes in mice. However， the mechanism of Tead4âs function in mouse preimplantation development and its conservation across mammals remains unclear. Here， we report that Tead4 is a crucial transcription factor necessary for blastocyst formation in mice. Disruption of TEAD4 through base editing results in developmental arrest at the morula stage. Additionally， RNA-seq analysis reveals dysregulation of 670 genes in Tead4 knockout embryos. As anticipated， Tead4 knockout leads to a decrease in trophectoderm genes CDX2 and GATA3. Intriguingly， we observed a reduction in KRT8， suggesting that Tead4 influences the integrity of the trophectoderm epithelium in mice. More importantly， we noted a decrease in nuclear YAP for Tead4-deficient embryos， indicating that Tead4 directly regulates Hippo signaling. In contrast， bovine embryos with TEAD4 depletion can still develop to blastocysts with normal expression of CDX2， GATA3， and SOX2， albeit with a decrease in total cell number and ICM cell number. In conclusion， we propose that Tead4 regulates mouse blastocyst formation via Krt8 and Yap， both of which are critical regulators of mouse preimplantation development.,PolyA RNA profiles of  bovine and mouse embryos,nan,

Centralized control of dynamic gene regulatory circuits governs human T cell rest and activation [Perturb-CITE-seq],GSE278572,Homo sapiens,The ability of individual cells to maintain a distinct identity and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks. However， how discrete sets of gene regulators coordinate circuits that respond to extracellular cues remains poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in human CD4+ T cells， where distinct cell lineages must respond to diverse signals to orchestrate effective adaptive immune responses and maintain homeostasis. Here， we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL2RA， which is a canonical marker of T cell activation in pro-inflammatory effector T cells (Teffs) and constitutively expressed in anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) where it is required for fitness. Strikingly， the majority of identified regulators are required in discrete cell type and stimulation timepoints， and a subset even had opposite functional effects in different conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits， we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. Upstream of these networks， MED12 â a component of the Mediator complex â serves as a dynamic orchestrator of regulators across conditions， governing both cell type- and stimulation-specific gene expression. MED12 interacts with the histone modifying complex COMPASS， affecting chromatin state and expression of genes encoding key context- and lineage-specific regulators; including rest maintenance factor KLF2 and activation promoting genes. We demonstrated that CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted this cell state transition and protected T cells from activation-induced cell death. Overall， this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across primary cell conditions to identify context-specific regulators and dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.,Perturb-CITE-seq performed with 2 donors including resting and stimulated CD4+ Tregs and Teffs,39663454,Nature
Spatiotemporal dynamics of the developing zebrafish enteric nervous system at the whole organ level,GSE274407,Danio rerio,Neural crest cells give rise to the neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) that innervate the gastrointestinal tract to regulate gut motility. The immense size and distinct subregions of the gut present a challenge to understanding the spatial organization and sequential differentiation of different neuronal subtypes. Here， we profile enteric neurons and progenitors at single cell resolution during zebrafish embryonic and larval development to provide a near complete picture of transcriptional changes that accompany emergence of ENS neurons throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Multiplex spatial RNA transcript analysis reveals the temporal order and distinct localization patterns of neuronal subtypes along the length of the gut. Finally， we show that functional perturbation of select transcription factors Ebf1a， Gata3 and Satb2 alters the cell fate choice， respectively， of inhibitory， excitatory and serotonergic neuronal subtypes in the developing ENS.,Cells in the developing ENS of the Tg(Phox2bb:mNeonGreen) zebrafish were isolated by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) according to the presence of mNeonGreen signal and used for scRNA-seq experiment.,39642879,Dev Cell

Less Deformable Erythrocyte Subpopulations Biomechanically Induce Endothelial Inflammation in Sickle Cell Disease,GSE274340,Homo sapiens,Sickle cell disease (SCD) is canonically characterized by reduced red blood cell (RBC) deformability leading to microvascular obstruction and inflammation. While the biophysical properties of sickle RBCs are known to influence SCD vasculopathy， the contribution of poor RBC deformability to endothelial dysfunction has yet to be fully explored. Leveraging interrelated in vitro and in silico approaches， we introduce a new paradigm of SCD vasculopathy in which poorly deformable sickle RBCs directly cause endothelial dysfunction via mechanotransduction， where endothelial cells sense and pathophysiologically respond to aberrant physical forces independently of microvascular obstruction， adhesion， or hemolysis. We demonstrate that perfusion of sickle RBCs or pharmacologically-dehydrated healthy RBCs into small venule-sized âendothelializedâ microfluidics leads to pathologic physical interactions with endothelial cells that directly induce inflammatory pathways. Using a combination of computational simulations and large venule-sized endothelialized microfluidics， we observed that perfusion of heterogeneous sickle RBC subpopulations of varying deformability， as well as suspensions of dehydrated normal RBCs admixed with normal RBCs leads to aberrant margination of the less-deformable RBC subpopulations towards the vessel walls， causing localized， increased shear stress. Increased wall stress is dependent on the degree of subpopulation heterogeneity and oxygen tension and leads to inflammatory endothelial gene expression via mechanotransductive pathways. Our multifaceted approach demonstrates that the presence of sickle RBCs with reduced deformability leads directly to pathological physical (i.e.， direct collisions and/or compressive forces) and shear-mediated interactions with endothelial cells and induces an inflammatory response， thereby elucidating the ubiquity of vascular dysfunction in SCD.,Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) collected after exposure to healthy red blood cells (hRBCs) or a binary suspension of 5% pharmacologically-dehydrated RBCs (pdRBCs) in hRBCs， using a four-channel 50 Âµm microfluidic device. To mimic the decreased deformability of sickle RBCs， hRBCs were pharmacologically-dehydrated with nystatin and high sucrose washes according to established practices to create RBCs with an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 40-42 g/dL.  Following endothelialization of the microfluidic channels， the hRBC or 5% pdRBCs were perfused according to our established protocol.  After endothelial cells were collected from the microfluidic devices and resuspended in media， the suspension was passed through 70 and 40 Î¼m cell strainers and centrifuged at 500xg at 4Â°C for 10 minutes. For RBC lysis， ACK buffer was added. For immediate single-cell capture， the cells were pelleted at 400xg at 4Â°C for 5 minutes and resuspended in PBS containing 1.0% BSA to get a concentration of 500 cells/Î¼l. For single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)， barcoded gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) were generated from single-cell suspensions with gel beads and reverse transcription (RT) mix on the Chromium Controller， following the 10x Genomics workflow. Following RT and cDNA amplification， the Chromium Next GEM 5âreagent kit v2 (10x Genomics) was used to generate 5â gene expression libraries.

Multiplexed single-cell characterization of alternative polyadenylation regulators (MPRA),GSE269595,Homo sapiens,Most mammalian genes have multiple polyA sites， representing a substantial source of transcript diversity regulated by the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) machinery. To better understand how these proteins govern polyA site choice we introduce CPA-Perturb-seq， a multiplexed perturbation screen dataset of 42 CPA regulators with a 3â scRNA-seq readout that enables transcriptome-wide inference of polyA site usage. We develop a framework to detect perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of co-regulated polyA sites. We find groups of intronic polyA sites regulated by distinct components of the nuclear RNA life cycle including elongation， splicing， termination， and surveillance. We train and validate a multi-task deep neural network (APARENT-Perturb) for tandem polyA site usage， delineating a cis-regulatory code that predicts perturbation response and reveals interactions between regulatory complexes. Our work highlights the potential for multiplexed single-cell perturbation screens to further our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation.,We conducted a pooled single-cell CRISPR screen (in both HEK293FT and K562 cell lines) targeting 42 genes previously implicated in regulating cleavage and polyadenylation.

We validate our polyA site quantifications by performing 3'RACE followed by Illumina sequencing at 7 loci in NT and NUDT21-perturbed cells. We also built a sequence-based deep learning model (APARENT-Perturb) to describe how sequence affects perturbation， and design an MPRA to validate these sequence-based predictions on polyA site usage.,38925112,Cell

Characterization and bioinformatic filtering of ambient gRNAs in single-cell CRISPR screens using CLEANSER [scRNA-seq],GSE272457,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Recent technological developments in single-cell RNA-seq CRISPR screens enable high-throughput investigation of the genome. Through transduction of a gRNA library to a cell population followed by transcriptomic profiling by scRNA-seq， it is possible to characterize the effects of thousands of genomic perturbations on global gene expression. A major source of noise in scRNA-seq CRISPR screens are ambient gRNAs， which are contaminating gRNAs that likely originate from other cells. If not properly filtered， ambient gRNAs can result in an excess of false positive gRNA assignments. Here， we utilize CRISPR barnyard assays to characterize ambient gRNA noise in single-cell CRISPR screens. We use these datasets to develop and train CLEANSER， a mixture model that identifies and filters ambient gRNA noise. This model takes advantage of the bimodal distribution between native and ambient gRNAs and includes both gRNA and cell-specific normalization parameters， correcting for confounding technical factors that affect individual gRNAs and cells. The output of CLEANSER is the probability that a gRNA-cell assignment is in the native distribution over the ambient distribution. We find that ambient gRNA filtering methods impact differential gene expression analysis outcomes and that CLEANSER outperforms alternate approaches by increasing gRNA-cell assignment accuracy.,gRNA library transduction: HEK293T dCas9KRAB cells were seeded at a density of 5x104 cells/cm2 and NIH3T3 dCas9KRAB cells were seeded at a density of 1.25x104 cells/cm2 on 6-well plates in one biological replicate each. The cells were transduced with lentivirus using 8 Î¼g/mL polybrene at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~10 as determined by titration. Two days post-transduction， cells were treated with either 500 (HEK293T dCas9KRAB + non-targeting library #1 cells) or 1000 (NIH3T3 dCas9KRAB + non-targeting library #2 cells) ng/mL puromycin or 20 (HEK293T dCas9KRAB cells + non-targeting library #1) or 80 (NIH3T3 dCas9KRAB cells + non-targeting library #2) Î¼g/mL blasticidin and were selected for 10 days. 7 days post-transduction， cells were trypsinized and seeded on 6-well plates in three conditions: 1) HEK293T dCas9KRAB + non-targeting library #1 cells at a density of 3.9 x 104 cells/cm2 2) NIH3T3 dCas9KRAB + non-targeting library #2 cells at a density of 1.5 x 104 cells/cm2 3) HEK293T dCas9KRAB + non-targeting library #1 cells at a density of 2.0 x 104 cells/cm2 and NIH3T3 dCas9KRAB + non-targeting library #2 cells at a density of 2.0 x 104 cells/cm2  CRISPR barnyard single-cell RNA-seq: 10 days post transduction， cells were washed three times， trypsinized， and strained through a 40 Âµm cell strainer.

Single-cell analysis of non-myocytes during heart regeneration reveals sequential coordinated responses from distinct cell populations [scRNA-seq],GSE145980,Danio rerio,Cardiac regeneration occurs primarily through proliferation of existing cardiomyocytes， yet the regenerative response also involves complex interactions between distinct cardiac cell types including not only cardiomyocytes， but also non-cardiomyocytes (nonCMs). However， the molecular features and cellular functions of the highly heterogeneous populations of nonCMs and how these populations cooperate to regenerate the injured heart remain largely unexplored. Using the newly developed LIGER algorithm that allows flexible modeling across highly diverse single-cell datasets， we analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of 61，977 individual nonCMs isolated at multiple time points during zebrafish heart regeneration. Combining single-cell analysis and in situ hybridization， we identified major nonCM cell types， including multiple novel subpopulations with unique tempo-spatial distributions and highly cooperative interactions in the regenerating heart. Interestingly， genetic perturbation of macrophage function by kit knockout led to accumulation of fibrotic deposits and severely compromised cardiomyocyte proliferation and myocardium regeneration. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of nonCMs during cardiac regeneration provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of cardiac regeneration.,Single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cardiac non-cardiomyocytes isolated at multiple time points during zebrafish heart regeneration were generated by deep sequencing using 10X Genomics Chromium System.,34523214,EMBO Rep
Translation of zinc finger domains induces ribosome collision and Znf598-dependent mRNA decay in zebrafish [Ribo-seq],GSE236144,Danio rerio,Quality control of translation is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Obstacles in translation elongation induce ribosome collision， which is monitored by multiple sensor mechanisms in eukaryotes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf598 recognizes collided ribosomes， triggering ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to rescue stalled ribosomes and no-go decay (NGD) to degrade stall-prone mRNAs. However， the impact of RQC and NGD on maintaining the translational homeostasis of endogenous mRNAs has remained unclear. In this study， we investigated the endogenous substrate mRNAs of NGD during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of zebrafish development. RNA-Seq analysis of zebrafish znf598 mutant embryos revealed that Znf598 downregulates mRNAs encoding the C2H2-type zinc finger domain (C2H2-ZF) during the MZT. Reporter assays and disome profiling indicated that ribosomes stall and collide while translating tandem C2H2-ZFs， leading to mRNA degradation by Znf598. Our results suggest that NGD maintains the quality of the translatome by mitigating the risk of ribosome collision at the abundantly present C2H2-ZF sequences in the vertebrate genome.,Ribosome profiling,39636823,PLoS Biol
Centralized control of dynamic gene regulatory circuits governs human T cell rest and activation [H3K27ac_CUTnRUN],GSE244035,Homo sapiens,The ability of individual cells to maintain a distinct identity and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks. However， how discrete sets of nuclear regulators coordinate dynamic circuits that respond to extracellular cues remains poorly defined. This is prominent in CD4+ T cells， where cells must respond to diverse immunogenic signals to orchestrate effective adaptive immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis. Here， we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify nuclear regulators that control expression of IL2RA， a canonical marker of T cell activation that is differentially regulated between pro-inflammatory effector T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. Strikingly， we discovered that the majority of identified regulators function within discrete cell type and stimulation timepoints， and a subset even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics and surface proteomics after pooled perturbation of context specific screen hits， we characterized many factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. KLF2， MYB， and SOCS3 were distinguished as interconnected repressors of activation in resting T cells while GATA3 and MYC are required for proper stimulation response. Upstream of these circuits， MED12 â a component of the Mediator complex â serves as a dynamic orchestrator of trans regulators across conditions， governing both cell type and stimulation specific gene expression. Chromatin analysis revealed how MED12 coordinates key regulators as T cells transition to and from rest and activation. We demonstrated that CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted this transition and protected T cells from activation-induced cell death.,H3K27ac CUT&RUN for CRISPR KO primary human CD4+ Teffs and CD4+ Tregs.

TEAL-seq (Targeted Expression Analysis Sequencing)  of S. aureus and S. epidermidis in TSB and skin-relevent conditions,GSE279187,Escherichia coli;Staphylococcus aureus;Staphylococcus epidermidis;Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Metagenome sequencing enables discovery and genetic characterization of complex microbial communities from diverse ecosystems. However， determining the activity of isolates within a community using transcriptomics presents several challenges including the wide dynamic range of organismal and gene expression abundances， the presence of host RNA， and low microbial biomass at many body sites. To address these limitations， we developed âTargeted Expression Analysis Sequencingâ or TEAL-seq. Targeting strategies enabled sensitive species-specific analyses of gene expression using highly multiplexed custom probe pools targeting about 1700 core and accessory genes of Staphylococcus aureus (S.a.) and S. epidermidis (S.e.)， two key species of the skin microbiome. Two targeting methods were applied to mixed cultures and nasal swab specimens from human research participants. Both methods showed a high degree of specificity， with >90% reads on target， even in the presence of complex microbial or human background DNA/RNA. Targeting using molecular inversion probes demonstrated excellent correlation in inferred expression levels with bulk RNA-seq. Further， we show that a linear pre-amplification step to increase the amount of input nucleic acids for analysis was quite reproducible . While pre-amplification introduced some noise compared to non-amplified samples， it also enabled profiling of expression from as little as 1 ng of total RNA. TEAL-seq is much less expensive than bulk metatranscriptomic profiling and enables detection across a greater dynamic range. Custom probe pools are readily configurable and this strategy is broadly applicable for determining the transcriptional status of organisms in any microbial community.,S. aureus and S. epidermidis were grown in TSB， TSB pH 4.8 or on reconstructed human epidermidis for bulk and targted RNA-seq with and without ribo-depletion and/or SPIA.,nan,

Spatially restricted immune and microbiota-driven adaptation of the gut [scRNA-seq],GSE245315,Mus musculus,The intestine is characterized by an environment where host requirements for efficient nutrient and water absorption are consequently paired with the requirement to establish and maintain tolerance to the outside environment. The organ is anatomically organized into the small intestine (SI) which specializes in nutrient absorption and the colon which specializes in water resorption. The transcriptional and cellular circuits that define intestinal regionalization and their robustness， adaptability， and resilience to changes in the local environment are not well characterized. Here， we generated a comprehensive survey of the spatial and cellular landscape of the murine intestine to demonstrate the steady state transcriptional landscape of the murine intestine is robust， adaptable， and resilient to perturbation. We characterized the transcriptional landscape of the full length of the intestine and show it is established independently of the microbiota and is not under circadian regulation. In the colon， these regional circuits were characterized by unique subsets of structural cells. Moreover， we identified a spatial adaptation to the microbiota in the colon characterized by the emergence of unique structural cell subsets including an enterocyte， fibroblast， and goblet cell， with the later two co-occurring in space. Employing a model of acute spatiotemporal damage allowed us to show the spatial landscape and adaptations we identified are both resilient to inflammation. Our results demonstrate that intestinal circuits are under host control and spatial adaptations in the steady state as well as in the process of recovery from tissue damage in the inflamed state are primarily characterized by changes to structural cell types such as epithelial and stromal cells.,Single cell suspensions were generated for single cell RNA sequencing from 4 different segments (A-D) of mouse colon from WT SPF and GF mice and 2 segments (B-C) from WT FMT mice. 3 biological replicates were generated for each segment for both SPF and GF mice. 2 biological replicates were generated for each segment for FMT mice. Samples were compared within SPF mice to establish the cellular complexity of different regions in the steady state and subsequently compared to GF mice and FMT mice to establish those that are dependent on the microbiota.,39567686,Nature
Integration of epigenome and lactylome reveals the regulation of lipid production in Nannochloropsis oceanica [RNA-Seq],GSE260894,Nannochloropsis oceanica,Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a kind of novel post-translational modification (PTM)， which participates in gene expression and various metabolic processes. Nannochloropsis， a significant oleaginous microalgae of economic significance， demonstrates a remarkable capacity for triacylglycerol (TAG) production under nitrogen stress. To elucidate the involvement of lactylation in lipid synthesis， we conducted ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq analyses to monitor lactylation modifications and transcriptome alterations in Nannochloropsis oceanica. In all， 2，057 genes showed considerable variation between nitrogen deprivation (ND) and nitrogen repletion (NR) conditions， comprising 853 upregulated genes and 1，204 downregulated genes. Moreover， a total of 5，375 differential Kla peaks were identified， including 5，331 gain peaks and 44 loss peaks under ND vs NR. The differential Kla peaks were primarily distributed in the promoter (<= 1 kb) (71.07%)， 5âUTR (22.64%)， and exon (4.25%). Integrative analysis of ChIP-seq， transcriptome， and previous proteome and lactylome data elucidates the potential mechanism by which lactylation promotes lipid accumulation under ND. Lactylation facilitates autophagy and protein degradation， leading to the recycling of carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle， thereby providing carbon precursors for lipid synthesis. Additionally， lactylation induces the redirection of carbon from membrane lipids to TAG by upregulating lipases and enhancing the TCA cycle and Î²-oxidation pathways. This research reveals the regulatory functions of lactylation in lipid metabolism and gene expression in Nannochloropsis， offering a new perspective for the investigation of lipid biosynthesis.,mRNA profiles of Nannochloropsis oceanica under nitrogen repletion and nitrogen deprivation.,38842303,J Agric Food Chem

Alarmin-loaded extracellular lipid droplets induce airway neutrophil infiltration during type 2 inflammation,GSE245964,Mus musculus,Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) play a crucial role in allergic diseases by coordinating a complex network of various effector cell lineages involved in type 2 inflammation. However， their function in regulating airway neutrophil infiltration， a deleterious symptom of severe asthma， remains unknown. Here， we observed ILC2-dependent neutrophil accumulation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of allergic mice models. Chromatography followed by proteomics analysis identified the alarmin high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the supernatant of lung ILC2s initiated neutrophil chemotaxis. Genetic perturbation of Hmgb1 in ILC2s reduced BALF neutrophil numbers and alleviated airway inflammation. HMGB1 was loaded onto the membrane of lipid droplets (LDs) released from activated lung ILC2s. Genetic inhibition of LD accumulation in ILC2s significantly decreased extracellular HMGB1 abundance and BALF neutrophil infiltration. These findings unveil a previously uncharacterized extracellular LD-mediated immune signaling delivery pathway by which ILC2s regulate airway neutrophil infiltration during allergic inflammation.,Bone marrow neutrophils and lung ILC2s were isolated from wildtype (WT) mice in homeostasis for in vitro stimulation and Bulk RNA-seq. ILC-enriched population (CD45+CD3-CD19- cells) was purified from the lungs of Il5cre/+Hilpda+/+ and Il5cre/+Hilpdaflox/flox mice at day 3 after IIL-33 treatment for scRNA-seq.,nan,
Role of CD133 molecule in WNT response and renal repair,GSE107273,Homo sapiens,Renal repair after injury is dependent on clonal expansion of proliferation competent cells. In the human kidney， the expression of CD133+ characterizes a population of resident scattered cells with resistance to damage and ability to proliferate. However， the biological function of the CD133 molecule is unknown. We found by RNA sequencing that cells undergoing cisplatin damage lost the CD133 signature and acquired metanephric mesenchymal and regenerative genes such as SNAIL1， KLF4， SOX9 and WNT3. CD133 was reacquired in the recovery phase. Lack of CD133 was specifically correlated with deregulation of the Wnt signalling and E-cadherin pathway and， functionally， limited cell proliferation after injury. By immunoprecipitation， CD133 appeared to form a complex with E-cadherin and Î²-catenin. In parallel， CD133-Kd cells showed lower Î²-catenin levels in basal condition and after Wnt pathway activation and reduced TCF/LEF promoter activation in respect to CD133+ cells. Finally， the lack of CD133 impaired generation of nephrospheres while favored senescence. These data indicate that CD133 may act as a permissive factor for beta-catenin signalling， preventing its degradation in the cytoplasm. Therefore， CD133 itself appears to play a functional role in renal tubular repair trough maintenance of proliferative response and control of senescence.,Expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing,29431914,Stem Cells Transl Med
A comprehensive assessment of RNA-seq accuracy， reproducibility and information content by the Sequence Quality Control consortium,GSE56457,Homo sapiens,We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project， coordinated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Examining Illumina HiSeq， Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls， we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for sequence discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths， we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions， with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast， RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements， and gene-specific biases are observed， for these and qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline， and variation is large for transcriptlevel profiling. The complete SEQC data sets， comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb)， provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings.,The well-characterized reference RNA samples A (pooled cell lines) and B (human brain) from the MAQC consortium， adding spike-ins of synthetic RNA from the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC).  Samples C and D were then constructed by combining A and B in known mixing ratios， 3:1 and 1:3， respectively.  All samples were distributed to several independent sites for RNA-Seq library construction and profiling by Illumina HiSeq 2000 and LifeTech SOLiD 5500 platforms.  Also， vendors created their own cDNA libraries that were then distributed to each test site， in order to examine the degree of a âsite effectâ that was independent of the library preparation process.  To support an assessment of gene models， samples A and B were also sequenced at independent sites by the Roche 454 platform， providing longer reads.  For comparison to other technologies， these data were also compared to the MAQC-I Affymetrix U133 Plus2 microarray， several current microarray platforms， and also assessed by 20，801 PrimePCR reactions.,25150838,Nat Biotechnol
Degradation of Ikaros prevents epigenetic progression of T cell exhaustion in novel antigen-specific assay [scRNA-seq],GSE244180,Homo sapiens,Epigenetic regulation drives the differentiation of T cells into phenotypically stable subsets including a dysfunctional state termed exhaustion， the presence of these epigenetically distinct T cells in tumors make them non-responsive to checkpoint blockade. Cancer immunotherapies restoring T cell function have transformed cancer treatment by preventing immune evasion of tumor cells allowed by T cell exhaustion. However， some patients develop resistance to immunotherapy or do not respond. Recent literature has demonstrated that epigenetic regulation governs the transition from effector to exhausted T cells. Here， we describe a novel antigen-specific assay for T-cell exhaustion that produces T cells biologically and epigenetically similar to their in vivo exhausted counterpart. We perform a CRISPR KO screen for epigenetic regulators of the human genome and validate Ikaros as a driver of T-cell exhaustion. We determined that the Ikaros degrader iberdomide prevents exhaustion by blocking chromatin remodeling at T cell effector enhancers by preserving activity of key transcription factors AP-1， NF-ÎºB and NFAT using transcription factor footprinting analysis. Thus， our study uncovers a role for Ikaros， degraded by the drug iberdomide， as a driver of T-cell exhaustion.,SHARE-seq to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in T cells from four healthy human donors.

m6A RNA Methylation Is Regulated by MicroRNAs and Promotes Reprogramming to Pluripotency,GSE52125,Mus musculus,N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been recently identified as a conserved epitranscriptomic modification of eukaryotic mRNAs， but its features， regulatory mechanisms， and functions in cell reprogramming are largely unknown. Here， we report m6A modification profiles in the mRNA transcriptomes of four cell types with different degrees of pluripotency. Comparative analysis reveals several features of m6A， especially gene- and cell-type-specific m6A mRNA modifications. We also show that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate m6A modification via a sequence pairing mechanism. Manipulation of miRNA expression or sequences alters m6A modification levels through modulating the binding of METTL3 methyltransferase to mRNAs containing miRNA targeting sites. Increased m6A abundance promotes the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to pluripotent stem cells; conversely， reduced m6A levels impede reprogramming. Our results therefore uncover a role for miRNAs in regulating m6A formation of mRNAs and provide a foundation for future functional studies of m6A modification in cell reprogramming.,m6A-seq in ESC， iPSC， NSC and sertoli cells.,25683224,Cell Stem Cell

The role of m6A/m-RNA methylation in stress response regulation,GSE113801,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) and N6，2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) are abundant mRNA modifications that regulate transcript processing and translation. The role of both， here termed m6A/m， in the stress response in the adult brain in vivo are currently unknown.Here， we provide a detailed analysis of the stress-epitranscriptome using m6A/m-Seq， global and gene-specific m6A/m measurements. We show that stress exposure and glucocorticoids region- and time-specifically alter m6A/m and its regulatory network. We demonstrate that deletion of the methyltransferase Mettl3 or the demethylase Fto in adult neurons alter the m6A/m epitranscriptome， increase fear memory， alter the transcriptome response to fear and synaptic plasticity. Moreover， we report that regulation of m6A/m is impaired in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients following glucocorticoid stimulation.Our findings indicate that brain m6A/m represents a novel layer of complexity in gene expression regulation after stress and that dysregulation of the m6A/m-response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders.,Refer to individual Series,30048615,Neuron

Centralized control of dynamic gene regulatory circuits governs human T cell rest and activation [ChIPseq_MED12_RNAPol_CXXC1],GSE271089,Homo sapiens,The ability of individual cells to maintain a distinct identity and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks. However， how discrete sets of gene regulators coordinate circuits that respond to extracellular cues remains poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in human CD4+ T cells， where distinct cell lineages must respond to diverse signals to orchestrate effective adaptive immune responses and maintain homeostasis. Here， we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL2RA， which is a canonical marker of T cell activation in pro-inflammatory effector T cells (Teffs) and constitutively expressed in anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) where it is required for fitness. Strikingly， the majority of identified regulators are required in discrete cell type and stimulation timepoints， and a subset even had opposite functional effects in different conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits， we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. Upstream of these networks， MED12 â a component of the Mediator complex â serves as a dynamic orchestrator of regulators across conditions， governing both cell type- and stimulation-specific gene expression. MED12 interacts with the histone modifying complex COMPASS， affecting chromatin state and expression of genes encoding key context- and lineage-specific regulators; including rest maintenance factor KLF2 and activation promoting genes. We demonstrated that CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted this cell state transition and protected T cells from activation-induced cell death. Overall， this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across primary cell conditions to identify context-specific regulators and dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.,ChIPseq experiment comparing changes in Teff after MED12 KO compared to AAVS1 KO control samples.

Autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells acquire an exhausted phenotype and persist in human antigen-specific autoimmune diseases,GSE242232,Homo sapiens,Pro-inflammatory autoantigen-specific CD4+ T helper (auto-Th) cells are central orchestrators of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). We aimed to characterize these cells in human AIDs with defined autoantigens by combining human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-tetramer-based and activation-based multidimensional ex vivo analyses. In aquaporin4-antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-NMOSD) patients， auto-Th cells expressed CD154， but proliferative capacity and pro-inflammatory cytokines were strongly reduced. Instead， exhaustion-associated co-inhibitory receptors were expressed together with FOXP3， the canonical regulatory T cell (Treg) transcription factor. Auto-Th cells responded in vitro to checkpoint inhibition and provided potent B cell help. Cells with the same exhaustion-like (ThEx) phenotype were identified in soluble liver antigen (SLA)-antibody-autoimmune hepatitis and BP180-antibody-positive bullous pemphigoid， AIDs of the liver and skin， respectively. While originally described in cancer and chronic infection， our data point to T cell exhaustion as a common mechanism of adaptation to chronic (self-)stimulation across AID types and link exhausted CD4+ T cells to humoral autoimmune responses， with implications for therapeutic targeting.,For single-cell RNA-seq， PBMCs were stimulated for 6 h (with AQP4， MP65， and Influenza HA peptide pools or PMA/Ionomycin)， CD154+ memory cells were isolated by MACS and further purified by FACS sorting on a FACS Aria Fusion (BD Bioscience， San Jose， CA， USA) based on dual expression of CD154 and CD69 and expression of CD45RO. Cells were directly sorted into skirted 96-well PCR plates which were equipped with 2 ï­l lysis buffer (nuclease-free water with 0.2% Triton-X 100 solution (Roche Diagnostics GmbH， Mannheim， Germany) with 4 U/ÂµL RNase Inhibitor (New England Biolabs)) in advance. After FACS sorting plates were shortly centrifuged (30 sec， 200xg) and immediately frozen at -80Â°C until shipment. Library preparation and sequencing was performed at the DRESDEN-concept Genome Center (DcGC， TU Dresden， Germany). The workflow was based on the previously described SMARTseq2 protocol 81. After thawing the samples， 2 ul of a primer mix was added (5 mM dNTP (Invitrogen)， 0.5 uM dT-primer*， 4 U RNase Inhibitor (NEB)). RNA was denatured for 3 minutes at 72Â°C and the reverse transcription was performed at 42Â°C for 90 min after filling up to 10 ul with RT buffer mix for a final concentration of 1X superscript II buffer (Invitrogen)， 1 M betaine， 5 mM DTT， 6 mM MgCl2， 1 uM TSO-primer*， 9 U RNase Inhibitor and 90 U Superscript II. After synthesis， the reverse transcriptase was inactivated at 70Â°C for 15 min. The cDNA was amplified using 2X Kapa HiFi HotStart Readymix (Roche) at a final 1X concentration and 0.1 uM UP-primer* under following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 98Â°C for 3 min， 22 cycles [98Â°C 20 sec， 67Â°C 15 sec， 72Â°C 6 min] and final elongation at 72Â°C for 5 min. The amplified cDNA is purified using 0.6X volume of hydrophobic Sera-Mag Beads (Cytvia: GE24152105050250，) and DNA was eluted in 12 ul nuclease free water. The cDNA quality and concentration of a few representative samples was determined with the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent). For library preparation， 2 Âµl amplified cDNA was tagmented in 1X Tagmentation Buffer using 0.8 Âµl bead-linked transposome (Illumina DNA Prep， (M) Tagmentation， Illumina) at 55Â°C for 15 min in a total volume of 4 ÂµL. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 Âµl of 0.1 % SDS (37Â°C， 15 min). Magnetic beads were bound to a magnet， the supernatant was removed， beads were resuspended in 4 Âµl indexing PCR Mix containing 1x KAPA Hifi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche). After adding 700 nM unique dual indexing primers (i5 and i7) using Echo Acoustic Liquid Handler (Echo 525， Beckman Coulter)， the reaction mixture was subjected to a PCR (72Â°C 3 min， 98Â°C 30 sec， 12 cycles [98Â°C 10 sec， 63Â°C 20 sec， 72Â°C 1 min]， 72Â°C 5 min). After PCR， libraries are quantified with a Tecan plate reader Infinite 200 pro in 384 well black flat bottom low volume plates (Corning) using AccuBlue Broad range chemistry (Biotium) and equimolarly pooled using Echo Acoustic Liquid Handler (Echo 525， Beckman Coulter GmbH).  The pooled libraries were then purified with 0.9x volume Sera-Mag SpeedBeads， followed by a double size selection with 0.6x and 0.9x volume of beads. Re-double size selection with 0.6x and 0.9x volume of beads was performed if needed. Sequencing was performed after quantification using a Fragment Analyzer on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 aiming at an average sequencing depth of 0.5 mio 100 bp paired-end fragments per cell.The method used for this single cell RNA seq is SMARTseq2 which is the full length transcriptome sequencing， thus the TCR sequences come from the same library as the expression data. However， always in some random cells， the full length of TCR alpha/beta or both are not sequenced， so it is not possible to recognize the TCR sequence， but still the expression data is available for these cells. This is the reason why fewer cells in the TCR file compare to the expression matrix (i.e. 928 samples vs. 924 columns in RawExpressionCountTable.csv， 829 data rows in TCR_data.csv),39226901,Immunity
Low-input， deterministic profiling of single-cell transcriptomes reveals individual intestinal organoid subtypes comprised of single， dominant cell types [Intestinal crypts],GSE183691,Mus musculus,High-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to resolve cellular properties across systems. A key scRNA-seq catalyzer was the introduction of microdroplet-based systems， which vastly improved sample handling and cell throughput. While powerful， the current microfluidic systems are limited to high cell density (>1000 cells) samples. This prevents the efficient processing of individual， small tissues or rare cells， leading to respectively confounded mosaic cell population read-outs or failed capture of diagnostically interesting cells.  In this study， we developed a deterministic， mRNA-capture bead and cell co-encapsulation droplet system， DisCo， that overcomes these limitations by enabling precise particle position and droplet sorting control through combined machine-vision and multilayer microfluidics. We demonstrate that DisCo is capable of processing samples containing few cells (< 100 cells) at high efficiencies( >70%). To underscore the unique capabilities of DisCo， we mapped the developmental process of 31 individual intestinal organoids at the single cell level. This uncovered extensive cellular heterogeneity among organoids， revealing two so far uncharacterized organoid subtypes， âgobloidsâ and spheroids， predominantly consisting of respectively Muc2+ goblet and Ly6a+ stem cells. Further Disco data analysis thereby revealed strongly increased Yap1 target gene expression in these spheroids， suggesting mechano sensing as the underlying mechanism for their spontaneous formation.  Together， our novel âno-cell-left-behindâ platform enables the deterministic processing of input cells， allowing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity among rare cells or individual， small tissues or organoids.Together， our novel âno-cell-left-behindâ platform enables the deterministic processing of input cells， allowing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity among rare cells or individual， small tissues or organoids.,Crypts were isolated from single small intestines of 7-week old male C57BL/6J mice following the protocol from Bas and Augenlicht et al. Briefly， the small intestine of one mouse was isolated and then washed both on the inside and outside with ice cold PBS. The small intestine was cut open longitudinally and washed again with PBS. The intestine was then non-enzymatically digested for 3 minutes in PBS/EDTA/DTT. Next， the tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred into a 50 mL Falcon tube containing 20 mL of ice-cold PBS. The PBS solution containing the tissue pieces was gently triturated 10 times using a 10 mL pipette. After tissue fragments had sedimented， the supernatant was removed， and the process was repeated three more times until the supernatant was clear. Next， the supernatant was removed， PBS/EDTA was added and the sample incubated for 30 minutes at 4oC on a rocking plate. After incubation， tissue fragments were left for sedimentation (up to 5 minutes)， then the supernatant was removed. Subsequently， tissue fragments were triturated with ice cold PBS by pipetting up and down. After large tissue fragments sedimented (up to 5 minutes)， the supernatant containing crypts was collected as Fraction 1 (F1). Fraction collection was repeated five times (F2-F5)， followed by trituration with ice cold PBS， while each fraction was stored separately. Each fraction was inspected for cell debris and villus contamination.For single-cell bulk sample preparation， crypts from F2 or F3 were spun down at 600 x g for 10 minutes (brake 5). Following centrifugation， the supernatant was removed and cells were enzymatically dissociated for 1 minute at 37oC. Cells were then washed two times in PBS/BSA and strained two times using a Flowmi 40 Âµm strainer to minimize the doublet rate. Cell suspensions were diluted in cell loading buffer and applied to the loading tip connected to the DisCo chip. For single-cell isolation from single crypts， crypts from F3 were transferred to FBS coated 6 well plates. Subsequently， single crypts were isolated by hand-picking after which they were transferred to a Nunc microwell culture plate containing single crypt dissociation mix. Single crypts were dissociated by combining trituration using non-filter pipette tips every 5 minutes and incubation at 37oC for a total of 15 minutes. Following dissociation， cell suspensions were diluted in cell loading buffer and applied to the loading tip connected to the DisCo chip.,nan,
Genomic distribution of H3K9me2 in wild-type vs. arle-14 mutant C. elegans embryos,GSE113841,Caenorhabditis elegans,We discovered arle-14/B0336.5 as a critical gene for H3K9 di-methylation. To test the hypothesis that ARLE-14 targets the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 to specific loci， we compared the distribution of H3K9me2 in wild-type and arle-14 mutants by ChIP-Seq. Our results reveal that H3K9me2 genomic distribution is similar in wild-type vs. mutants and ARLE-14 is not required for targeting MET-2.,We used two biological replicates for each genotype (wild-type and arle-14 mutant).  Input DNA was used as a control for each sample.  arle-14 mutants have overall lower levels of H3K9me2. In this experiment， we collected 3 times more material from arle-14 mutants compared to wild-type to get enough material for sequencing. We note that the results are not quantitative in terms of H3K9me2 levels.,30140741,Sci Adv
Simultaneous Profiling of Chromatin-Associated RNA at Targeted DNA Loci and RNA-RNA Interactions through TaDRIM-Seq II,GSE276894,Arabidopsis thaliana;Homo sapiens;Oryza sativa Indica Group,The enormous variety of different RNAs are transcribed from eukaryotic genome. Some RNAs， particular long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)，  enrich on chromatin via transcribed RNAs to retain at their transcription site (Cis-acting RNAs) and recruited to different genomic regions (Trans-acting RNAs)， which play significant roles in regulating gene transcription， epigenomic modifications and mediating chromatin states. Here， we developed TaDRIM-Seq (Targeted DNA-associated RNA and RNA-RNA Interactions Mapping by Sequencing) method to capture RNA-DNA  on specific protein region and RNA-RNA spatial interactions in nuclei. We performed TaDRIM-Seq of antibodies H3， H3K9ac and H3K27me3 in rice and H3K4me3 and CTCF in human K562 cells， to identify chromatin-interacting RNAs and RNA-RNA interactions.,We report TaDRIM-Seq technique PG-Tn5-mediated targeted DNA element and proximity ligation to simultaneously detect chromatin-associated RNAs in diverse regions of the genome and RNA-RNA spatial interactions in nuclei.,39929795,Nat Commun
Single-cell multi-modal profiling of proteins and chromatin accessibility using PHAGE-ATAC [Spike_mix_pbmcs],GSE172920,Homo sapiens,Multi-modal measurements of single cell profiles are a powerful tool for characterizing cell states and regulatory mechanisms. While current methods allow profiling of RNA along with either readouts of chromatin or protein， connecting chromatin state to protein levels remains a barrier. Here， we developed PHAGE-ATAC， a method that uses engineered camelid single-domain antibody (ânanobodyâ)-displaying phages for simultaneous single-cell measurement of surface proteins， chromatin accessibility profiles， and mtDNA-based clonal tracing through a single-cell and massively parallel droplet-based assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). We demonstrate PHAGE-ATAC for multimodal analysis in primary human immune cells， for multiplexing， for intracellular protein analysis， and for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Finally， we construct a synthetic high-complexity phage library for selection of novel antigen-specific nanobodies that bind cells of particular molecular profiles， opening a new avenue for protein detection， cell characterization and screening with single-cell genomics.,A mix of PBMCs and 293T cells expressing either membrane-exposed EGFP-GPI or the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were incubated with a panel of phage nanobodies and processed for PHAGE-ATAC,34675424,Nat Biotechnol
ZFP36-family RNA-binding proteins in regulatory T cells reinforce immune homeostasis [single cell RNA-seq],GSE240517,Mus musculus,RNA binding proteins (RBP) of the ZFP36 family limit the differentiation and effector functions of CD4 and CD8 T cells， but little is known of their expression or function in regulatory T cells (Treg). By Treg-restricted deletion of Zfp36 family members we identify the essential role of Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2 in Treg to maintain immune homeostasis. Mice with Tregs deficient in these RBP display an inflammatory phenotype with an expansion in the numbers of type-2 conventional dendritic cells， T effector cells， T follicular helper and germinal center B cells and elevated serum cytokines and immunoglobulins. In the absence of Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2， the pool of cycling CTLA-4 in naÃ¯ve Treg was reduced， Tregs were less sensitive to IL-2 and IL-7 but were more sensitive to IFNÎ³. In mice lacking both RBP in Treg， the deletion of a single allele of Ifng is sufficient to ameliorate the pathology. Thus， ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 regulate multiple pathways that enable Tregs to enforce immune homeostasis.,Single cell RNA-sequencing of control and Zfp36l1/Zfp36l2-deficient regulatory T cells (Treg) from 14-week-old mice， with one replicate per genotype. Deletion was driven by the Foxp3-YFP-Cre allele. Treg from the two genotypes were labelled using Totalseq oligo-conjugated antibodies (BioLegend)， before pooling， such that library generation and sequencing was performed within a single sample.,nan,
Degradation of Ikaros prevents epigenetic progression of T cell exhaustion in novel antigen-specific assay [scATAC-seq],GSE244162,Homo sapiens,Epigenetic regulation drives the differentiation of T cells into phenotypically stable subsets including a dysfunctional state termed exhaustion， the presence of these epigenetically distinct T cells in tumors make them non-responsive to checkpoint blockade. Cancer immunotherapies restoring T cell function have transformed cancer treatment by preventing immune evasion of tumor cells allowed by T cell exhaustion. However， some patients develop resistance to immunotherapy or do not respond. Recent literature has demonstrated that epigenetic regulation governs the transition from effector to exhausted T cells. Here， we describe a novel antigen-specific assay for T-cell exhaustion that produces T cells biologically and epigenetically similar to their in vivo exhausted counterpart. We perform a CRISPR KO screen for epigenetic regulators of the human genome and validate Ikaros as a driver of T-cell exhaustion. We determined that the Ikaros degrader iberdomide prevents exhaustion by blocking chromatin remodeling at T cell effector enhancers by preserving activity of key transcription factors AP-1， NF-ÎºB and NFAT using transcription factor footprinting analysis. Thus， our study uncovers a role for Ikaros， degraded by the drug iberdomide， as a driver of T-cell exhaustion.,SHARE-seq to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in T cells from four healthy human donors. Donor PBMCs were expanded for antigen-specific T cells using viral peptide cocktail over the course of 7 or 14 days. Iberdomide or DMSO was used to treat cells from day 7 -14.,nan,
Loss of miR-145 promotes remyelination and functional recovery in a model of chronic centrel demyelination,GSE268808,Rattus norvegicus,Strategies for treating progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) remain limited. Here， we found that miR-145-5p is overabundant uniquely in chronic lesion tissues from secondary progressive MS patients. We induced both acute and chronic demyelination in miR-145 knockout mice to determine its contributions to remyelination failure. Following acute demyelination， no advantage to miR-145 loss could be detected. However， after chronic demyelination， animals with miR-145 loss demonstrated increased remyelination and functional recovery， coincident with altered presence of astrocytes and microglia within the corpus callosum relative to wild-type animals. This improved response in miR-145 knockout animals coincided with a pathological upregulation of miR-145-5p in wild-type animals with chronic cuprizone exposure， paralleling human chronic lesions. Furthermore， miR-145 overexpression specifically in oligodendrocytes (OLs) severely stunted differentiation and negatively impacted survival. RNAseq analysis showed altered transcriptome in these cells with downregulated major pathways involved in myelination. Our data suggest that pathological accumulation of miR-145-5p is a distinctive feature of chronic demyelination and is strongly implicated in the failure of remyelination， possibly due to the inhibition of OL differentiation together with alterations in other glial cells. This is mirrored in chronic MS lesions， and thus miR-145-5p serves as a potential relevant therapeutic target in progressive forms of MS.,RNA-seq samples aligned to RNor6， OL-miR-145 and OL-miR-ctl (derived from primary cultures treated with miRNA mimics in vitro).,38965401,Commun Biol
Cell type-specific binding patterns reveal that TCF7L2 can be tethered to the genome by association with GATA3,GSE38447,Homo sapiens,The TCF7L2 transcription factor is linked to a variety of human diseases， including type 2 diabetes and cancer. One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding  to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis， we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in 6 human cell lines. We identified 116，000 non-redundant TCF7L2 binding sites， with only 1，864  sites common to the 6 cell lines. Using ChIP-seq， we showed that many genomic regions that are marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac are also bound by TCF7L2， suggesting that TCF7L2 plays a critical role in enhancer  activity. Bioinformatic analysis of the cell type-specific TCF7L2 binding sites revealed enrichment for multiple transcription factors， including HNF4alpha and FOXA2 motifs in HepG2 cells and the GATA3 motif in MCF7 cells. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that TCF7L2 co-localizes with HNF4alpha and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells and with GATA3 in MCF7 cells. Interestingly， in MCF7 cells the TCF7L2 motif is enriched in most TCF7L2 sites but is not enriched in the sites bound by both GATA3 and TCF7L2. This analysis suggested that GATA3 might tether TCF7L2 to the genome at these sites. To test this hypothesis， we depleted GATA3 in MCF7 cells and showed that TCF7L2 binding was lost at a subset of sites. RNA-seq analysis suggested that TCF7L2 represses transcription when tethered to the genome via GATA3. Our studies demonstrate a novel relationship between GATA3 and TCF7L2，  and reveal important insights into TCF7L2-mediated gene regulation.,RNAseq analysis of MCF7 cells transfected with siCONTROL， siTCF7L2 or siGATA3.ChIP-seq analysis of H3K27ac， H3K4me1， H3K27me3， H3K9me3 in MCF7 cells; H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in HCT116 cells.,22951069,Genome Biol

Acetylation is not mere a consequence of transcription: histones are acetylated without ongoing transcription [EU-seq],GSE260923,Mus musculus,In all eukaryotes， acetylation of histones lysine residues correlates with transcription activation. Whether histone acetylation is a cause or consequence of transcription is debated. One model suggests that transcription promotes the recruitment and/or activation of acetyltransferases and histone acetylation occurs as a consequence of ongoing transcription. However， the extent to which transcription shapes the global acetylation landscapes is not known. Here we show that global protein acetylation remains virtually unaltered after acute transcription inhibition. Transcription inhibition ablates the co-transcriptionally occurring ubiquitylation of H2BK120 but does not reduce histone acetylation. The combined inhibition of transcription and CBP/p300 further demonstrates that acetyltransferases remain active and continue to acetylate histones independently of transcription. Together， these results show that histone acetylation is not a mere consequence of transcription; acetyltransferase recruitment and activation is uncoupled from the act of transcription and histone and non-histone protein acetylation are sustained in the absence of ongoing transcription.,EU-seq experiments in ESC with triptolide treatment. The corresponding EU-seq experiments in ESC without triptolide treatment are publiclly available on GSE146328.,38862536,Nat Commun
ChIP-Seq of H4K5acK8ac and BRD2 in H23 NSCLC cell line treated with 500 nM JQ1 for 24h,GSE113714,Homo sapiens,Changes in acetylation of histone H4 are a common hallmark of cancer cells. In leukemia cells， histone H4 is characterized by loss of K16 mono-acetylation. Bromodomain proteins specifically recognize acetylated lysines and have been used as a target for anti cancer drug， JQ1 and iBET. Although acetylation and de-acetylation of histone H4 have been shown to have big impact in cancer cells， little attention has been focused on histone H4-acetylation at a genome level. To uncover potential epigenetic role of hyper-acetylated histone H4 at a genome-wide level in cancer cell， we generated a novel monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing histone H4 with at least two acetylated lysine residues (H4K5ac+K8ac).  At the genome-wide level， hyper-acetylated histone H4 is associated with promoter and regulatory element (active enhancer， eRNA and super enhancer). We show that diacetylation at K5 and K8 of histone H4 co-localizes H3K27ac and BRD2 in the majority of active enhancer and promoters. However BRD2 has a stronger association with H4K5acK8ac. Furthermore we identified two specific chromatin states， which separately contain either H3K27ac or acetylated histone H4.  Although JQ1 led to global reduction of BRD2 binding on the chromatin， only local changes of histone H4 multi-acetylation were observed upon BET inhibition by JQ1,ChIP-Seq of H4K5acK8ac and BRD2 in H23 NSCLC cell line treated with 500 nM JQ1 for 24h,30080437,Epigenetics
Inner nuclear protein Matrin-3 coordinates cell differentiation by stabilizing chromatin architecture [RNA-Seq],GSE181233,Mus musculus,Precise control of gene expression during differentiation relies on the interplay of chromatin and nuclear structure. Despite an established contribution of nuclear membrane proteins to developmental gene regulation， little is known regarding the role of inner nuclear proteins. Here we demonstrate that loss of the nuclear scaffolding protein Matrin-3 (Matr3) in erythroid cells leads to morphological and gene expression changes characteristic of accelerated maturation， as well as broad alterations in chromatin organization similar to those accompanying differentiation. Matr3 protein interacts with CTCF and the cohesin complex， and its loss perturbs their occupancy at a subset of sites. Destabilization of CTCF and cohesin binding correlates with altered transcription and accelerated differentiation. This association is conserved in embryonic stem cells. Our findings indicate Matr3 negatively affects cell fate transitions and demonstrate that a critical inner nuclear protein impacts occupancy of architectural factors， culminating in broad effects on chromatin organization and cell differentiation.,mRNA expression profiles of control and Matr3 KO in MEL and mouse ES cells during differentiation,34716321,Nat Commun
Centralized control of dynamic gene regulatory circuits governs human T cell rest and activation [CRISPR_Screens],GSE276097,Homo sapiens,The ability of individual cells to maintain a distinct identity and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks. However， how discrete sets of gene regulators coordinate circuits that respond to extracellular cues remains poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in human CD4+ T cells， where distinct cell lineages must respond to diverse signals to orchestrate effective adaptive immune responses and maintain homeostasis. Here， we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL2RA， which is a canonical marker of T cell activation in pro-inflammatory effector T cells (Teffs) and constitutively expressed in anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) where it is required for fitness. Strikingly， the majority of identified regulators are required in discrete cell type and stimulation timepoints， and a subset even had opposite functional effects in different conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits， we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. Upstream of these networks， MED12 â a component of the Mediator complex â serves as a dynamic orchestrator of regulators across conditions， governing both cell type- and stimulation-specific gene expression. MED12 interacts with the histone modifying complex COMPASS， affecting chromatin state and expression of genes encoding key context- and lineage-specific regulators; including rest maintenance factor KLF2 and activation promoting genes. We demonstrated that CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted this cell state transition and protected T cells from activation-induced cell death. Overall， this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across primary cell conditions to identify context-specific regulators and dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.,Pooled CRISPR KO screens for IL2RA. Screens were performed using a library targeting trans regulators and immune genes in CD4+ T cell subsets.,39663454,Nature

Human Airway Smooth Muscle Transcriptome Changes in Response to Asthma Medications,GSE52778,Homo sapiens,Rationale: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease. The most common medications used for its treatment are Î²2-agonists and glucocorticosteroids， and one of the primary tissues that these drugs target in the treatment of asthma is the airway smooth muscle.

Metabolic pathways for lignin-related aromatic compounds elucidated in a Xanthomonas phytopathogen,GSE252662,Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri 306,Convergent microbial biocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach for the conversion of lignin side-streams into value-added chemicals in recent decades. However， the current knowledge of metabolic pathways directing the bioconversion of lignin-related aromatics is still limited to a few microbial species and unavailable for some of these compounds. Thus， the aim of this study was to identify the genes involved in the bioconversion of aromatic compounds in Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri 306 (X. citri 306)， a bacterium belonging to a compelling yet untapped genus for studies on lignin-related aromatics metabolism. For this purpose， we used an integrative approach including genome data mining， RNA-seq， enzymology and gene knockout studies. The RNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 278 to 1464 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the aromatic-containing conditions compared to the control XVM2m-glucose， evidencing the importance of these compounds in modulating various physiological processes of X. citri 306 beyond the pathways related to their metabolism. Moreover， this work revealed the operon molRKAB， which plays a role in the first catabolic steps of the three main monolignols (p-coumaryl， coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols)， besides showing all the enzymatic steps funneling them up to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Additionally， the study uncovered aryl aldehyde reductases and efflux strategies that likely function to protect the pathogen from aromatics toxicity. Together， these findings enhance the current understanding of Xanthomonas metabolism and transcriptional responses to lignin-related aromatic compounds， shedding light on the diverse metabolic pathways available to enable the engineering of microbial chassis dedicated to lignin valorization.,To investigate the transcriptional profile of X. citri 306 in response to lignin-related compounds， samples of cells grown on XVM2m minimal medium supplemented with six lignin-related aromatic compounds， three complex mixtures of lignin-derived compounds， and glucose (reference) were collected in four biological replicates. Total RNA was extracted and used to generate RNA-Seq libraries. Differential expression analysis was carried out by pairwise comparisons between X. citri 306 grown in XVM2m supplemented with lignin-related aromatics and XVM2m(G) containing glucose (reference medium).,39266555,Nat Commun

Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits， we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. Upstream of these networks， MED12 â a component of the Mediator complex â serves as a dynamic orchestrator of regulators across conditions， governing both cell type- and stimulation-specific gene expression. MED12 interacts with the histone modifying complex COMPASS， affecting chromatin state and expression of genes encoding key context- and lineage-specific regulators; including rest maintenance factor KLF2 and activation promoting genes. We demonstrated that CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted this cell state transition and protected T cells from activation-induced cell death. Overall， this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across primary cell conditions to identify context-specific regulators and dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.,CUT&RUN experiment comparing changes in Teff after MED12 KO compared to AAVS1 KO control samples or kinase inhibitor treatment (SEL120-24A) compared to H2O control treatment.

MeCP2 regulates genome-wide gene expression through recognition of H3K27me3 [ChIP_human],GSE122364,Homo sapiens,MeCP2 plays a multifaceted role in gene expression regulation and chromatin organization. Interaction between MeCP2 and methylated DNA to regulate gene expression is well established. However， the widespread MeCP2 distribution suggests its additional interactions with chromatin. Here we show， by both biochemical and ChIP-seq analyses， that MeCP2 directly binds to nucleosome subunit proteins and is recruited to distinct chromatin regions where H3K27me3 is enriched. We further observed that the impact of MeCP2 on transcriptional changes is correlated with histone post-translational modification patterns. Our findings indicate that MeCP2 can be recruited to genomic loci via indirect binding and that interaction between MeCP2 and histone proteins plays a significant role in gene expression regulation.,In order to perform genome-wide quantitative comparisons of histone modification difference between DMSO and GSK343 treatment， the drosophila S2 genome was added to each experiment. An exogenous genome-derived normalizing factor was used for normalization.Please note that each processed data file was generated from both rep1 and rep2 samples， and is linked to the corresponding rep1 sample records.,nan,
Transfer learning associates CAFs with EMT and inflammation in tumor cells in human tumors and organoid co-culture in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [Bulk RNA-seq],GSE245319,Homo sapiens,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment enriched with cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This study provides a convergence approach to identify tumor cell and CAF interactions through the integration of single-cell data from human tumors with human organoid co-culture. Analysis of a comprehensive atlas of PDAC single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data associates CAF density with increased inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells. Transfer learning to transcriptional data from patient-derived organoid and CAF co-cultures provides in silico validation of CAF induction of inflammatory and EMT epithelial cell states. Further experimental validation in co-cultures demonstrates integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) and vascular endothelial factor A (VEGF-A) interactions with Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) mediating CAF and epithelial crosstalk. This study introduces transfer learning from human single-cell data to organoid co-culture for experimental validation of discoveries of cell-cell crosstalk， and identifies fibroblast-mediated regulation of EMT and inflammation.,Patient matched organoids and cancer associated fibroblasts were generated from PDAC surgical speciments gathered at JHU. Samples were cultured in either monoculture or coculture conditions using a matrigel substrate. For bulk-RNA sequencing， samples were FACS sorted based on EPCAM (for organoids) and FAP (for CAFs) expression prior to RNA isolation.**Submitter declares that the raw data will be deposited in dbGaP due to patient privacy concerns***,nan,

Dynamics of the chili pepper transcriptome during fruit development,GSE54123,Capsicum annuum,BackgroundThe set of all mRNA molecules present in a cell constitute the transcriptome. The transcriptome varies depending on cell type as well as in response to internal and external stimuli during development. Chili pepper is an economically and culturally important horticultural crop as well as a good model for the study of secondary metabolism during fruit development. Here we present a study of the changes that occur in the transcriptome of chili pepper fruit during development and ripening.ResultsRNA-Seq was used to obtain transcriptomes of whole Serrano-type chili pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum L.; 'Tampiqueno 74') collected at 10， 20， 40 and 60 days after anthesis (DAA). 15，550，468 Illumina MiSeq reads were assembled de novo into 34，066 chili genes. We classified the expression patterns of individual genes as well as genes grouped into Biological Process ontologies and Metabolic Pathway categories using statistical criteria. For the analyses of gene groups we added the weighted expression of individual genes. This method was effective in interpreting general patterns of expression changes and increased the statistical power of the analyses. Subsets of genes were expressed only at a single time point sampled (1，278， 1，596， 1，519 and 1，583 genes at 10， 20， 40 and 60 DAA， respectively). We also estimated the variation in diversity and specialization of the transcriptome during chili pepper development. Approximately 17% of genes exhibited a significant change of expression in at least one of the intervals sampled. In contrast， significant differences in approximately 63% of the Biological Processes and 80% of the Metabolic Pathways studied were detected in at least one interval. Confirming previous reports， genes related to capsaicinoid and ascorbic acid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated at 20 DAA while those related to carotenoid biosynthesis were highly expressed in the last period of fruit maturation (40-60 DAA). Our RNA-Seq data was validated by examining the expression of nine genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis by qRT-PCR.ConclusionsIn general， more profound changes in the chili fruit transcriptome were observed in the intervals between 10 to 20 and 40 to 60 DAA. The last interval， between 40 to 60 DAA， included 49% of all significant changes detected， and was characterized predominantly by a global decrease in gene expression. This period signals the end of maturation and the beginning of senescence of chili pepper fruit. The transcriptome at 60 DAA was the most specialized and least diverse of the four states sampled.,RNA-seq libraries of whole chili pepper (Capsicum annuum Serrano 'Tampiqueno 74' landrace) were prepared from fruits at 10， 20， 40 and 60 days after anthesis (DAA). Two biological replicates of each fruit state were prepared (8 libraries in total). Libraries were sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq platform.  The title of the libraries are: <DAA>repbio<#> where <DAA> are the days after anthesis (10， 20， 40 or 60) and <#> is the number of biological replicate， 1 or 2. Details follow.Biological material and RNA extractionCapsicum annuum Serrano 'Tampiqueno 74' seeds were germinated and the seedlings were cultivated until maturity under greenhouse conditions in a completely randomized experimental design at Cinvestav-Unidad Irapuato (Guanajuato， Mexico). The plants were grown during the spring and summer， and individual flowers were tagged at anthesis. Chili pepper fruits were randomly collected from different plants at 10， 20， 40 and 60 DAA. After sampling， the fruits were cleaned with ethanol immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. For total RNA extractions， 10 fruits at the 10 DAA developmental stage and 5 fruits from each of the 20， 40 and 60 DAA stages were randomly selected from the pool of all harvested fruits. Whole fruits (pericarp， placenta and seeds) were ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle to form a fine uniform powder. Samples were mixed vigorously and 100 mg aliquots were measured for each RNA extraction. The process was repeated with different sets of fruits in order to obtain two independent biological replicates at each developmental stage. A NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used for total RNA extraction and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNase I (Macherey-Nagel) treatment following the manufacturers' protocols.Total RNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop， Wilmington， DE， USA) and RNA quality was evaluated by gel electrophoresis on 1.0% denaturing agarose gels. In addition， aliquots of RNA were run on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using RNA 6000 chips (Agilent， Santa Clara， CA， USA) to test the RNA integrity number (RIN). All eight samples had RIN values higher than 8.7. Thirty Î¼g of total RNA from each of the eight samples (two biological replicates of four fruit developmental stages) was used for cDNA library preparation.Library construction and sequencingThe eight total RNA samples (two biological replicates from chili pepper fruits at 10， 20， 40 and 60 DAA) were prepared for RNA-Seq using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Guide following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly， mRNA was purified from 20Î¼g of total RNA using poly-T oligo- attached magnetic beads using two rounds of purification. During the second elution of the poly-A RNA， mRNA was fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature and primed for cDNA synthesis. The cleaved RNA fragments were primed with random hexamers and reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using reverse transcriptase. In the next step， the RNA template was removed and the complementary cDNA strand was synthesized using RNAse H and DNA polymerase I， respectively.The overhangs that resulted from fragmentation were polished into blunt ends using an End Repair Mix (consisting of T4 DNA polymerase， Klenow fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase). A single T nucleotide was added on the 3' end of the adapter for ligating the adapter to the cDNA fragments. Indexing adapters were ligated to the ends of the cDNAs using T4 DNA ligase， preparing them for hybridization onto a flow cell. Finally， the DNA fragments with adapter molecules at both ends were amplified by PCR to enrich the amount of DNA in the library. PCR was performed with a PCR primer cocktail that anneals to the ends of the adapters. Quantity and quality of the DNA libraries was assessed using Agilent DNA-1000 chips on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.The 8 cDNA libraries were pooled and simultaneously sequenced from both 5â and 3â ends using the Illumina MiSeq System platform according to the manufacturer's instructions. We performed three sequencing runs (technical replicates) with the aim of increase the sequencing depth. 150 bp paired-end reads were obtained in each sequencing run. Fluorescent image processing， base-calling and quality value calculations for each of the three runs were performed using Illumina MiSeq Control Software. Data were deposited at the NCBI (GEO database under series record GSE54123).,24555715,BMC Genomics
Strand-specific transcriptomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus,GSE58319,Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Saccharomyces paradoxus,Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that antisense transcription is pervasive in budding yeasts and is conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. While studies have examined antisense transcripts of S. cerevisiae for inverse transcription in stationary phase and stress conditions， there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the conditional specific evolutionary characteristics of antisense transcription between yeasts. Here we attempt to decipher the evolutionary relationship of antisense transcription of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cultured in mid log， early stationary phase， and heat shock conditions.Results: Massively parallel sequencing of sequence strand-specific cDNA library was performed from RNA isolated from S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus cells at mid log， stationary phase and heat shock conditions. We performed this analysis using a stringent set of sense ORF transcripts and non-coding antisense transcripts that were expressed in all the three conditions， as well as in both species. We found the divergence of the condition specific anti-sense transcription levels is higher than that in condition specific sense transcription levels， suggesting that antisense transcription played a potential role in adapting to different conditions. Furthermore， 43% of sense-antisense pairs demonstrated inverse transcription in either stationary phase or heat shock conditions relative to the mid log conditions. In addition， a large part of sense-antisense pairs (67%)， which demonstrated inverse transcription， were highly conserved between the two species. Our results were also concordant with known functional analyses from previous studies and with the evidence from mechanistic experiments of role of individual genes.Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive picture of the role of antisense transcription mediating sense transcription in different conditions across yeast species. We can conclude from our findings that antisense regulation could act like an on-off switch on sense regulation in different conditions.,Transcriptomes of two yeast species under mid-log phase， early stationary phase， and after heat shock treatment were generated by Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired-end sequencing,24965678,BMC Genomics
Synthetic genomic reconstitution reveals principles of mammalian Hox cluster regulation [Hi-C],GSE190894,Mus musculus,Precise Hox gene expression is crucial for embryonic patterning. Local transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have emerged as the major regulatory modes controlling the initiation and maintenance of Hox gene expression. However， quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here， we introduce âsynthetic regulatory reconstitutionâ， a novel conceptual framework for studying gene regulation and apply it to the mammalian HoxA cluster. To measure the HoxA intrinsic regulatory potential and distal enhancer contributions， we de novo synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130-170 kilobases each) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We find that a minimal HoxA cluster lacking distal enhancers induces the appropriate gene set and establishes distinct chromatin domains in response to patterning signals， while distal enhancers are required for full transcriptional output. These results suggest that the genomically compact Hox clusters contain all the information to decode patterning signals and maintain positional information,Hi-C was used to investigate topological organization in cells carrying synthetic Hox cluster variants during ESC-to-MN differentiation,nan,

RNA-seq profiles of rat cardiomyocytes overexpressing hsa-miR-106b-5p， hsa-miR-93-5p， hsa-miR-25-3p or cel-miR-67,GSE178867,Rattus norvegicus,Myocardial regeneration is restricted to early postnatal life， when mammalian cardiomyocytes still retain the ability to proliferate. The molecular cues that induce cell cycle arrest of neonatal cardiomyocytes towards terminally differentiated adult heart muscle cells remain obscure. We report that the miR-106b~25cluster is higher expressed in the early postnatal myocardium and decreases in expression towards adulthood， especially under conditions of overload， and orchestrates the transition of cardiomyocyte hyperplasia towards cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy by virtue of its targetome. To identify the relevant targets of individual miRNAs in the miR-106b~15 cluster and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the proliferative effects of this microRNA cluster， we assessed the global transcriptomic changes by deep-sequencing total neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte RNA after exogeneous transfection with hsa-miR-106b-5p， hsa-miR-93-5p， hsa-miR-25-3p and compared the transcriptomic profiles to cardiomyocytes transfected with cel-miR-67， a control miRNA.,Cardiomyocyte RNA profiles of 1-day old wild type (WT) rats overexpressing individual members of the miR-106b~25 microRNA cluster were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000; Four condition experiment; one replicate per condition,34376683,Nat Commun

Comprehensive evaluation of differential gene expression analysis methods for RNA-seq data,GSE49712,Homo sapiens,A large number of computational methods have been recently developed for analyzing differential gene expression (DE) in RNA-seq data. We report on a comprehensive evaluation of the commonly used DE methods using the SEQC benchmark data set and data from ENCODE project. We evaluated a number of key features including: normalization， accuracy of DE detection and DE analysis when one condition has no detectable expression. We found significant differences among the methods. Furthermore， computational methods designed for DE detection from expression array data perform comparably to methods customized for RNA-seq. Most importantly， our results demonstrate that increasing the number of replicate samples significantly improves detection power over increased sequencing depth.,The Sequencing Quality Control Consortium generated two datasets from two reference RNA samples in order to evaluate transcriptome profiling by next-generation sequencing technology.

Structural perturbation of chromatin domains with multiple developmental regulators can severely impact gene regulation and development [RNA-seq-blastocyst],GSE274230,Mus musculus,Chromatin domain boundaries delimited by CTCF motifs can restrict the range of enhancer action. However， disruption of domain structure often results in mild gene dysregulation and thus predicting the impact of boundary rearrangements on animal development remains challenging. Here， we tested whether structural perturbation of a chromatin domain with multiple developmental regulators can result in more acute gene dysregulation and severe developmental phenotypes. We targeted clusters of CTCF motifs in a domain of the mouse genome containing three FGF ligand genesÂ¬âFgf3， Fgf4， and Fgf15âthat regulate several developmental processesÂ¬. Deletion of the 23.9kb cluster that defines the centromeric boundary of this domainÂ¬ resulted in ectopic interactions of the FGF genes with enhancers located across the deleted boundary that are active in the developing brain. This caused strong induction of FGF expression and perinatal lethality with encephalocele and orofacial cleft phenotypes. Heterozygous boundary deletion was sufficient to cause these fully penetrant phenotypes， and strikingly， loss of a single CTCF motif within the cluster also recapitulated ectopic FGF expression and caused encephalocele. However， such phenotypic sensitivity to perturbation of domain structure did not extend to all CTCF clusters of this domain， nor to all developmental processes controlled by these three FGF genesÂ¬âfor example， the ability to undergo lineage specification in the blastocyst and pre-implantation development were not affected. By tracing the impact of different chromosomal rearrangements throughout mouse development， our work starts to uncover the determinants of phenotypic robustness and sensitivity to perturbation of chromatin boundaries.  Our data show how small sequence variants at certain domain boundaries can have a surprisingly outsized effect and must be considered as potential sources of gene dysregulation during development and disease.,RNA sequencing was done in single blastocysts， by isolating RNA using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Purification Kit as previously described (Huffman et al.， 2012). Blastocysts at E4.5 were flushed out of the uterine horns from super-ovulated females using M2 media and transferred into 50 Âµl of pre-warmed lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl pH-7.5， 500mM LiCl， 10mM EDTA pH-8， 1%LiDS， 5mM DTT) in DNA low binding PCR tubes. Lysed embryos were stored in -20C and processed within a few weeks. Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 mRNA isolation beads were warmed to room temperature for 30 mins and rinsed with 100 Âµl of lysis buffer by vortexing continuously for 5 mins. 10 Âµl of bead suspension was used per embryo lysate. The poly A tail of mRNA was allowed to anneal to beads by mixing the embryo lysates and bead suspension in a vortexer for 5 mins at low speed， followed by 5 mins incubation without shaking. Tubes were briefly spun and placed in a magnetic stand to collect the clear supernatant， which was used for DNA isolation using 2X SPRI beads to determine the genotype of each embryo. mRNA bead complexes were washed twice using Wash Buffer A and twice with Wash Buffer B by vortexing for 5 mins each. cDNA and library prep were then processed using an adaptation of the smartseq2 protocol (Picelli et al.， 2014; Satija et al.， 2015; Trombetta et al.， 2014). Buffers were removed and beads annealed with mRNA was resuspended in 12.5Âµl of RNA suspension mix containing 20U/Âµl SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher， #AM2694)， 10mM each dNTP Mix (New England Biolabs， #N0447L) and 100ÂµM polydT oligonucleotide primer (custom sequence âAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVNâ synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies). Bead suspension is heated at 75Â°C for 5mins to denature the RNA and supernatant is transferred into a new RNase free 0.2ml PCR tube.  To each sample tube 7.5Âµl of first strand reverse transcription mix with 100mM DTT， 5X SuperScript IV Buffer， SuperScriptTM IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher， #18090050)， 20U/Âµl SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher， #AM2694)， 100ÂµM of template switching oligo with 3Gâs and an adaptor sequence same as polydT oligonucleotide (custom sequence âAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNrGrGrGâ， Integrated DNA Technologies) was added and incubated at 50Â°C for 60 mins to prepare the first strand of cDNA， followed by 85Â°C for 5mins to inactivate the enzyme. The first strand of cDNA is bound by the template switching oligo and a complementary sequence to the template switching oligo was synthesized， where a PCR oligo is hybridized (custom sequence âAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTâ， Integrated DNA Technologies) and amplified. PCR cDNA amplification was done for 16 cycles (98Â°C for 15 secs， 67Â°C for 20 secs and 72Â°C for 10 mins) in a thermal cycler with KAPA Hifi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche， #9420398001). Pre-amplication cDNA mix was purified with 0.8X SPRI beads and quality of cDNA was assessed with a D5000 Screen Tape assay (Agilent， #5067-5588) using Agilent 4150 Tapestation. cDNA mix was diluted to 0.2ng/Âµl and used for library preparation as described earlier (Trombetta et al.， 2014) using Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina， #FC-131-1024). Briefly， in a 384 well plate， 1 Âµl of cDNA， 2Âµl of Tagment DNA Buffer and 1Âµl of Amplicon Tagment Mix was mixed in ice and tagmentation was done in a thermocycler at 55Â°C for 10 mins.

SEUSS: A scalable screening platform to assess transcriptomic and fitness effects of transcription factor overexpression,GSE107185,Homo sapiens;unidentified plasmid,Understanding the complex effects of genetic perturbations on cellular state and fitness in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been challenging using traditional pooled screening techniques which typically rely on unidimensional phenotypic readouts. Here， we use barcoded open reading frame (ORF) overexpression libraries with a coupled single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and fitness screening approach， a technique we call SEUSS (ScalablE fUnctional Screening by Sequencing)， to establish a comprehensive assaying platform. Using this system， we perturbed hPSCs with a library of developmentally critical transcription factors (TFs)， and assayed the impact of TF overexpression on fitness and transcriptomic cell state across multiple media conditions. We further leveraged the versatility of the ORF library approach to systematically assay mutant gene libraries and also whole gene families. From the transcriptomic responses， we built genetic co-perturbation networks to identify key altered gene modules. Strikingly， we found that KLF4 and SNAI2 have opposing effects on the pluripotency gene module， highlighting the power of our method to characterize the effects of genetic perturbations. From the fitness responses， we identified ETV2 as a driver of reprogramming towards an endothelial-like state.,Pooled transcription factor overexpression screens with scRNA-seq in ~35，000 cells across ten screens: 61 pluripotency/lineage TFs in hPSC media with five replicates， endothelial media with one replicate， multilineage media with two replicates; MYC mutant overexpression in hPSC media with one replicate; KLF family TF overexpression in hPSC media with one replicate.,30448000,Cell Syst
Integrative epigenetic taxonomy of primary prostate cancer [ChIP-Seq],GSE120738,Homo sapiens,The Androgen Receptor (AR) is the key-driving transcription factor in prostate cancer， tightly controlled by epigenetic regulation. To date， most epigenetic profiling has been performed in cell lines or limited tissue samples. To comprehensively study the epigenetic landscape， we complemented RNA-seq with ChIP-seq for AR and histone modification marks (H3K27ac， H3K4me3， H3K27me3) in 100 primary prostate carcinomas. Integrative molecular subtyping of the five data streams revealed three major subtypes of which two were clearly TMPRSS2-ERG dictated. Importantly， a third novel subtype was identified， with low AR chromatin binding and activity， even though the receptor was clearly expressed. While positive for neuroendocrine-hallmark genes， these tumors were copy number-neutral with low mutation burden， significantly depleted for genes characteristic of poor-outcome associated luminal B-subtype. We present a rich novel resource on transcriptional and epigenetic control in prostate cancer， revealing a tight control of gene regulation differentially dictated by AR over the three subtypes.,AR， H3K27ac， H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data for  primary prostate carcinomas,30464211,Nat Commun
Expression data from 30do mouse spermatid [Affymetrix],GSE29781,Mus musculus,Chromatin performs numerous functions during cellular differentiation， and therefore it must be capable of adopting a multitude of different structures. How these various structures are established is poorly understood， but we propose that specific histone H2A variants will have a key role in remodelling chromatin during differentiation. Structurally， we show here that the gain of just a single acidic amino acid residue has generated a new mouse âH2A.Bbd-likeâ histone variant， H2A.Lap1， and that when incorporated into nucleosomal arrays imparts on them unique biophysical properties that are distinct from arrays containing either H2A or human H2A.Bbd. Functionally， we identify H2A.Lap1 as a novel chromatin component of active genes that are expressed during spermatogenesis， and in combination with H2A.Z create a unique chromatin landscape at the start site of transcription. During round spermatid differentiation， H2A.Lap1 dramatically loads onto the inactive X chromosome enabling a subset of its genes to be transcriptionally activated.We used microarrays together with ChIP-seq data in order to see distribution of Lap1 and expression level of the Lap1 associated genes,Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were DNase I treated (Roche) and reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase following the manufacturerâs recommendations (Invitrogen). DNA was either analysed by semiâquantitative PCR， real-time qPCR using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems)， or subjected to DNA microarray analysis (in triplicate) using the GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix). Robust Multichip Average (RMA) correction and probe set summaries were obtained using Affymetrix Power Tools software annotation (Affymetrix) based on the mm9 mouse genome. Unless otherwise stated， all subsequent expression analyses (see Supplementary Methods) were performed in the R statistical computing environment (version 2.11.1).,22139013,Nat Struct Mol Biol
HSF1 ChIP-seq: Molecular mechanisms that distinguish TFIID housekeeping from regulatable SAGA promoters,GSE81787,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,An important distinction is frequently made between constitutively expressed housekeeping genes versus regulated genes. Although generally characterized by different DNA elements， chromatin architecture and cofactors， it is not known to what degree promoter classes strictly follow regulatability rules and which molecular mechanisms dictate such differences. We show that SAGA-dominated/TATA-box promoters are more responsive to changes in the amount of activator， even compared to TFIID/TATA-like promoters that depend on the same activator Hsf1. Regulatability is therefore an inherent property of promoter class. Further analyses show that SAGA/TATA-box promoters are more dynamic because TBP recruitment through SAGA is susceptible to removal by Mot1. In addition， the nucleosome configuration upon activator depletion shifts on SAGA/TATA-box promoters and seems less amenable to preinitiation complex formation. The results explain the fundamental difference between housekeeping and regulatable genes， revealing an additional facet of combinatorial control: an activator can elicit a different response dependent on core promoter class.,Hsf1 binding was determined under standard laboratory growth conditions using ChIP-seq. Hsf1 was depleted from the nucleus using the anchor away technique and subsequently changes in nucleosome positioning were investigated using Mnase-seq， with different concentrations of Mnase.,27979920,EMBO J
Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid-responsive transcripts in the hypothalamic paraventricular region of male rats,GSE120002,Rattus norvegicus,Purpose: we sought to search for genes that are transcribed or repressed in a glucocorticoid (GC)-dependent manner in a hypothalamic region containing the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH)， thereby unraveling mechanisms underlying GC-induced neuroendocrine and autonomic regulation.Methods: we employed unbiased quantification of the abundance of DNA transcripts provided by RNA-seq in the PVH region of male rats and identified genes whose expression is enhanced or suppressed by the 12-day exposure to a high dose of corticosterone (Cort) by Cort implant (12-day high Cort) or deprivation of corticoids for 7 days [7-day adrenalectomy (ADX)] (Experiment 1)， as well as by acute Cort increase (Experiment 2). Sham-ADX animals served as controls in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2， rats underwent ADX and supplemented with Cort in drinking water. The animals were decapitated at 1 h [acute Cort (1) 1 h] or 3 h [acute Cort (1) 3 h] following injection of HBC Cort (1 mg)， a dose shown to elicit plasma Cort surge comparable to that during acute stress. A group of rats without Cort injection served as controls (ADX + Cort suppl). Differential expression was calculated as fold-changes in gene expression [measured as fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM)]. The Benjamini & Hochberg method was applied to correct the unavoidable false positive data ensued from the multiple tests， and a q-value was calculated as the false discovery rate-adjusted p-value. The q-value < 0.05 was used as the cut-off criterion. Pearsonâs correlation analysis was carried out for grouping genes that showed similar expression patterns. qRTâPCR validation was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR mix. Semi-quantitative in situ hybridization was carried out using 35S-labeled cRNA probes.Results: some canonical GC target genes， among others of a broad functional spectrum， were upregulated prominently by 12-day high Cort. Crh was upregulated or downregulated most prominently by either 7-day ADX or 12-day high Cort， emphasizing the recognized feedback effects of GC on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Concomitant changes in Avp and Aplnr expression are likely to contribute to HPA repression. In keeping with the pleotropic cellular actions of GCs， 7-day ADX downregulated numerous genes of a broad functional spectrum. The transcriptome response signature differed markedly between acute Cort injection and 12-day high Cort. Remarkably， 6 immediate early genes， Bsx， Egr1， Fos， Fosb， Junb， and Nr4a3， were upregulated at 1 h after Cort injection， and the changes were confirmed by qRTPCR and semi-quantitative in situ hybridization.Conclusions: the present study uncovered a broad spectrum of Cort-responsive genes， potentially involved in the regulation of the HPA-axis， as well as other neuroendocrine and pre-autonomic functions of the PVH.,Transcriptome profiles of the hypothalamic region containing the PVH were generated by deep sequencing， in duplicate， using Illumina HiSeq2000.,30364965,Endocrinology

Mouse embryonic stem cells can differentiate via multiple paths to the same state [RNA-seq],GSE97390,Mus musculus,In embryonic development， cells must differentiate through stereotypical sequences of intermediate states to generate mature states of a particular fate. By contrast， direct programming can generate similar fates through alternative routes， by directly expressing terminal transcription factors. Yet the cell state transitions defining these new routes are unclear. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare two mouse motor neuron differentiation protocols: a standard protocol approximating the embryonic lineage， and a direct programming method. Both undergo similar early neural commitment. Then， rather than transitioning through spinal intermediates like the standard protocol， the direct programming path diverges into a novel transitional state. This state has specific and abnormal gene expression. It opens a 'loop' or 'worm hole' in gene expression that converges separately onto the final motor neuron state of the standard path. Despite their different developmental histories， motor neurons from both protocols structurally， functionally， and transcriptionally resemble motor neurons from embryos.,2 protocols were profiled at 3 timepoints each (samples 1-5)， and compared to primary embryonic motor neurons (sample 6). Each sample contains 667-1，057 single-cell transcriptomes (total = 5，405).,28990928,Elife
Multivalent binding of PWWP2A to H2A.Z-marked transcriptional active chromatin regulates mitosis and organ development [RNA-seq],GSE78003,Homo sapiens,The essential histone variant H2A.Z affects various DNA-based biological processes by so far not well understood mechanisms. Using a comprehensive label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach we identified the human H2A.Z nucleosome interactome providing further insights into H2A.Zâs regulatory functions. Besides histone modification writer， eraser and reader complexes we identified PWWP2A as a novel H2A.Z-nucleosome binder.

Early-life thymectomy leads to an increase of granzyme-producing Î³Î´ T cells in children with congenital heart disease,GSE274083,Homo sapiens,Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in newborns， often requiring cardiac surgery with concomitant thymectomy that is known to increase disease susceptibility later in life. Studies of Î³Î´ T cells， which are one of the dominant T cells in the early fetal human thymus， are rare. Here， we provide a comprehensive analysis of the Î³Î´ T cell compartment via flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing in children and infants with CHD， who underwent cardiac surgery shortly after birth. A perturbation of the Î³Î´ T cell repertoire is evident and VÎ´1 T cell numbers are reduced. However， those cells that are present， do retain cytotoxicity. In contrast， GZMA+CD28+CD161hi innate effector VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells are found in higher proportions. TCR-seq identifies an increase in TRDJ3+ Î³Î´ T cell clones in children with CHD， but not in a confirmatory group of neonates prior to CHD surgery， which overall points to a persistence of fetal-derived effector Î³Î´ T cells in children with CHD.,We aim to investigate the transcriptional profiles of T cells in children with CHD after thymectomy. To this end， scRNA-seq was performed on peripheral blood T cells from 5-12-year-old children with CHD who received thymectomy early after birth (CHD， n = 4， old_CHD) and control children (ctrl， n = 4， old_Ctrl). Next， to elucidate the impact of congenital heart surgery with concomitant removal of thymic tissue on the postnatal maturation of T cells within the first 6 months of life， we performed scRNA-seq of isolated peripheral blood T cells from two longitudinally followed infants with CHD before (Baseline， BSL， on day 8 and 9 of life， HLM139_1 and HLM140_1) and six months after surgery (Follow-up， FU， at day 188 and 189 of life， HLM139_2 and HLM140_2),nan,

Charting oncogenicity of genes and variants across lineages via multiplexed screens in teratomas,GSE169114,Homo sapiens,To deconstruct tissue-specific effects of genes and variants on proliferative advantage and transformation potential we developed a novel approach， harnessing single-cell cancer driver screens in teratomas coupled with hit enrichment by serial teratoma reinjection， to simultaneously screen drivers across multiple lineages in vivo. Using this system， we analyzed population shifts and lineage-specific enrichment for 51 cancer associated genes and gene variants， profiling over 100，000 cells spanning over 20 lineages， across two rounds of serially injected teratomas. We confirmed that c-MYC alone or combined with myristoylated AKT1 potently drives proliferation in progenitor neural lineages， demonstrating signatures of malignancy. These drivers directed teratoma development to lineages representative of pediatric tumors such as medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally， mutant MEK1 (S218D/S222D) provides a proliferative advantage in mesenchymal lineages like fibroblasts.,We first transduced H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with a library of 51 cancer drivers and injected them into immunodeficient mice to form round 1 teratomas in 4 mice. Cells prior to injection as well as each round 1 teratoma was dissociated and profiled via single cell RNA-seq. Cells from the dissociated round 1 teratomas were reinjected into immunodeficient mice to form round 2 tumors， 2 of which were profiled via single cell RNA-seq.  We then removed the most potent drivers in the initial screen， c-MYC and myristoylated AKT1， and formed a driver sub-library. H1 hESCs were transduced with this sub-library and injected  into immunodeficient mice to form round 1 teratomas. 3 of these round 1 teratomas were profiled via single cell RNA-seq. Cells from the dissociated round 1 teratomas were reinjected into immunodeficient mice to form round 2 tumors， 2 of which were profiled via single cell RNA-seq.  For each of the single cell RNA-seq runs， driver barcodes were associated with cell barcodes by amplifying from unfragmented cDNA.  Individual drivers which were top hits (c-MYC， myr-AKT1， c-MYC + myr-AKT1 and MEK1 (S218D/S222D)) were also profiled via bulk RNA-seq (2 tumors each) and barcode enrichment was assessed from genomic DNA.,34646987,iScience

Multiplex enhancer-reporter assays uncover unsophisticated p53 enhancer logic [ChIP-seq],GSE76655,Homo sapiens,Analysis of p53 binding sites using multiplex enhancer reporter assays， ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data.Transcription factors establish and maintain the specific transcriptome of a cell by binding to genomic regulatory regions， thereby regulating the transcription of their target genes. Like many transcription factors， the DNA sequence-specific binding preferences of p53 are known. However， it remains largely unclear what distinguishes functional enhancers from other bound genomic regions that have no regulatory activity. In addition， the genome is scattered with seemingly perfect recognition sequences that remain unoccupied. To disentangle the rules of genome-wide p53 binding， we employed two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays， one using barcoded reporters and the other using enhancer self-transcription. We compared the activity of more than one thousand candidate p53 enhancers under loss and gain of p53 conditions and identified several hundred high-confidence p53-responsive enhancers. Strikingly， the large majority (99%) of these target enhancers can be characterized and distinguished from negative sequences by the occurrence of a single p53 binding site. By training a machine learning classifier on these data， and integrating the resulting genome-wide predictions with fifteen publicly available human p53 ChIP-seq data sets， we identified a consensus set of 1148 functional p53 binding sites in the human genome. Unexpectedly， this direct p53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions， while differences between experiments can be largely attributed to indirect non-functional binding. Our data suggest that direct p53 enhancers function in a context-independent manner and do not contain obvious combinatorial complexity of binding sites for multiple transcription factors. They represent a class of unsophisticated cell-autonomous enhancers with a single binding site， distinct from complex developmental enhancers that integrate signals from multiple transcription factors. This suggests that context-dependent regulation of p53 target genes is not encoded in the p53 enhancer， but at different upstream or downstream layers of the cell's gene regulatory network.,Comparing active enhancers between p53 stimulated and non-stimulated MCF7 cells.,27197205,Genome Res
Mitochondrial-derived glutamate dictates resistance to pathogen infection through vitamin-dependent metabolic remodeling,GSE160652,Drosophila melanogaster,The functional integration of innate immune and metabolic signaling responses represents an ancient strategy to manage infections in metazoans.  Using Drosophila， we uncovered that immune-metabolic sensing in muscle dictates resistance to enteric bacterial infection through vitamins dependent metabolic remodeling. Within muscle， the activation strength of systemic innate immune signaling， integrated with mitochondrial-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh) function， conditions lipid mobilization from adipose. Mild intramuscular IMD/innate immune signaling activity allows for infection-mediated increases in mitochondrial biogenesis/function， which further stimulates mitochondria/Gdh-dependent synthesis of glutamate. Intramuscular derived glutamate acts as a systemic metabolite to influence lipid mobilization through altering vitamin metabolism. This lipid mobilization improves bacterial clearance and boost infection resistance. Conversely， elevated activation of IMD/innate immune signaling in muscle impedes infection-mediated increases in mitochondrial biogenesis/function and subsequent metabolic remodeling. Finally， life history traits that fine-tune intramuscular mitochondrial dynamics consequently influence infection resistance and shape phenotypic diversity of infection responses within populations.,We wanted to explore the muscle and adipose transcriptional networks in response to enteric bacterial infection. Utilizing transcriptomics (RNA-seq.)， we generated genome-wide expression profiles from dissected thoraces/muscle and carcass/fat body of Act88FGal4>UAS-RelishRNAi flies upon Mock (sucrose) or Pseudomonas entomophila (P.e.) oral infection (compared to controls [Act88FGal4>w1118)， and also drosocin-GFP (Dro-GFP) flies upon Mock (sucrose) or P.e. oral infection (Dro-GFP Positive and Dro-GFP Negative).,34710355,Cell Metab
TET2 regulates histone H2AK119ub and leukemogenesis through LTR RNA m5C oxidation [seq_RNA-nascentRNA],GSE241310,Mus musculus,Mutation of TET2 drives myeloid malignancy progression. TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin and activation of genes contributing to aberrant HSPC self-renewal. We show here that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C)， installed by NSUN2， can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein MBD6， which guides deubiquitylation of nearby histone H2AK119ub to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m5C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitylation. Thereby， TET2 depletion leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub， more open chromatin， and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2 mutant human leukemia became dependent on this gene activation pathway， with MBD6 silencing selectively inhibits proliferation of TET2 mutant leukemia in vitro and in vivo. Altogether， our findings reveal a previously unknown chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m5C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies.,RNA synthesis rate was measured with a procedure modified from the protocol Click-iTâ¢ Nascent RNA Capture Kit， for gene expression analysis (Invitrogen， C10365).,39358506,Nature

Large-scale discovery of chromatin dysregulation induced by oncofusions and other protein-coding variants,GSE243553,Homo sapiens,Although population-scale databases have expanded to millions of genetic variants， mechanistic insight into variant function has not kept pace. We present PROD-ATAC， a high-throughput method for discovering the effects of protein-coding variants on chromatin regulation. A pooled library of variants is expressed in a disease-agnostic biosensor cell line， and single-cell ATAC resolves each variantâs effect on chromatin. Using PROD-ATAC， we characterized the impacts of >100 oncogenic fusions and controls. We showed that pioneer activity is a common feature of fusions spanning an enormous range of frequencies. Further， fusion-induced dysregulation can be context-agnostic as observed mechanisms overlapped with cancer and cell-type specific prior knowledge. We also showed that gain-of-function pioneering is a common feature among oncofusions. This work provides a global view of fusion-induced chromatin disruption across many fusion frequencies and cancer types. Systematically dissecting this landscape revealed convergent mechanisms among seemingly disparate oncofusions and shared modes of chromatin dysregulation across different cancers.,A pooled library of >100 oncofusions and controls was expressed in HEK293T cells where each cell contained one protein-coding perturbation. 10X Genomics' droplet platform was used to capture ~120，000 nuclei (~10，000 nuclei per sample for 12 samples) and Spear-ATAC was used to resolve the effects of each variant on chromatin regulation. Note in this case the 12 samples all dervied from the same biological library of cells and are in this way replicates used to increase the number of nuclei captured (but they are not different biological conditions).,39048711,Nat Biotechnol

Clusters of lineage-specific genes are anchored by ZNF274 in repressive perinucleolar compartments [ChIP-seq],GSE234311,Homo sapiens,Epigenetic mechanisms influencing chromatin architecture are key to the spatio-temporal control of transcription. Here we identify ZNF274 as a new regulator of chromosome compartmentalization that silences lineage-specific gene clusters. ZNF274 is a SCAN-bearing member of the KrÃ¼ppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). Ablation of ZNF274 results in the transcriptional activation of genomic neighbourhoods encompassing， among others， zinc finger and protocadherin-encoding genes， with loss of H3K9me3 repressive mark， altered 3D genome conformation and de novo CTCF binding. In contrast to other factors that have been implicated in chromatin anchoring， ZNF274 is necessary both for transcriptional silencing and nucleolar tethering. While the establishment of silencing depends on the KRAB domain， we demonstrate that the SCAN domain is required to gather ZNF274 complexes at the nucleolus and efficiently spread heterochromatin. Thus， ZNF274 orchestrates the segregation of developmentally regulated gene clusters at nucleoli to allow timely and selective activation of cell-restricted alleles.,ChIP-seqs of H3K9me3 and ZNF274 mutants in ZNF274KO HEK293T cells.

A Reproducibility-Based Computational Framework Identifies An Inducible， Enhanced Antiviral Dendritic Cell State In HIV-1 Elite Controllers (TLR perturbation Bulk RNA-Seq),GSE108444,Homo sapiens,Human immunity relies on the coordinated responses of many cellular subsets and functional states. Inter-individual variations in cellular composition and communication could thus potentially alter host protection. Here， we explore this hypothesis by applying single-cell RNA-Seq to examine viral responses among the dendritic cells (DCs) of three elite controllers (ECs) of HIV-1 infection. We discover a highlyÂ functional antiviralÂ DCÂ state in ECsÂ whose fractional abundance afterÂ in vitroÂ exposure to HIV-1 correlates with higher CD4+Â T cell counts and lower HIV-1 viral loads， and that effectively primes polyfunctional T cell responsesÂ in vitro. WeÂ identify and validate selectÂ immunomodulators that increase the fractional abundance of this state inÂ primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individualsÂ in vitro.,Bulk RNA-seq profiling of TLR-perturbed cDCs and controls from a healthy donor for comparison with gene expression programs associated with cell-intrinsic HIV-1 immune recognition.,29378643,Genome Biol
Changes in chromatin accessibility in intratumoral CD8+ T cell subsets between young and aged TME,GSE255230,Mus musculus,Here， we present genome-wide comparisons of chromatin accessibility from endogenous CD8+ T cells and transferred OT-1 CD8+ T cells in young vs. aged B16-OVA tumors using ATAC-seq. This ATAC-seq dataset includes three different intratumoral CD8+ T cell subsets， such as TProg: Slamf6+Tim-3-， TTerm: Slamf6-Tim-3+， and TTAD: Slamf6-Tim-3-， as well as naive CD8+ T cells from spleens.,Live tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells or OT-1 CD8+ T cells from tumors on day 15 after tumor inoculation were sorted and pooled into 2 or 3 independent biological replicates， which ranged from 5，000 to 50，000 cells per genotype/subset combination (TProg: Slamf6+Tim-3-， TTerm: Slamf6-Tim-3+， and TTAD: Slamf6-Tim-3-). Pelleted cells were incubated in 5â50 Î¼l of reaction mix containing 2ÃTD， Tn5 enzyme， 2% digitonin in nuclease-free water at 37 Â°C for 30 min with agitation at 1000 RPM. MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen) was used for DNA purification. Following PCR， bead cleanup was done using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter/Agencourt)， library quality was verified using Tapestation analysis， and library quantification was confirmed by KAPA Library Quantification Kit IlluminaÂ® Platforms (Roche).

Cardiomyocyte gene programs encoding morphological and functional signatures in cardiac hypertrophy and failure (RNA-Seq),GSE95140,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Pressure overload induces a transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure， but its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we reconstruct a trajectory of cardiomyocyte remodeling and clarify distinct cardiomyocyte gene programs encoding morphological and functional signatures in cardiac hypertrophy and failure， by integrating single-cardiomyocyte transcriptome with cell morphology， epigenomic state and heart function. During early hypertrophy， cardiomyocytes activate mitochondrial translation/metabolism genes， whose expression is correlated with cell size and linked to ERK1/2 and NRF1/2 transcriptional networks. Persistent overload leads to a bifurcation into adaptive and failing cardiomyocytes， and p53 signaling is specifically activated in late hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific p53 deletion shows that cardiomyocyte remodeling is initiated by p53-independent mitochondrial activation and morphological hypertrophy， followed by p53-dependent mitochondrial inhibition， morphological elongation， and heart failure gene program activation.

LAP2alpha facilitates myogenic gene expression by preventing spreading of nucleoplasmic lamin A/C to active chromatin regions (ChIP-Seq),GSE247771,Mus musculus,A-type lamins form a filamentous meshwork beneath the nuclear membrane that anchors large heterochromatic chromatin domains at the nuclear envelope. They also exist as a more dynamic， non-filamentous pool in the nuclear interior， where they interact with gene-rich euchromatin. Lamin-associated polypeptide 2 alpha (LAP2alpha) binds to and maintains the nucleoplasmic lamin pool， but the functional significance of this interaction is poorly understood. Here we investigate the genome-wide chromatin association of A-type lamins during myogenic differentiation in the presence and absence of LAP2alpha.  We find that A-type lamins are significantly reorganized on chromatin upon depletion of LAP2alpha， spreading towards active chromatin and accumulating at regions of active H3K27ac and H3K4me3 histone marks close to the genes whose expression is impaired in the absence of LAP2alpha. This reorganization of A-type lamins on chromatin is accompanied by depletion of the active chromatin mark H3K27ac and a significant delay of myogenic differentiation. Thus， the interplay of lamins and LAP2alpha is crucial for proper positioning of intranuclear lamins on chromatin to allow normal myogenic differentiation.This research was funded in whole or in part by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) to Roland Foisner:P32512-B/DOI:10.55776/P36503https://www.doi.org/10.55776/P36503P36503-B/DOI:10.55776/P32512https://www.doi.org/10.55776/P32512,Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for A-type lamins， LAP2alpha and H3K27ac and H3K4me3 histone marks in wildtype and LAP2alpha knockout immortalized myoblasts in the proliferating (Prol) and early differentiating state (D2: day 2 after induction of differentiation).,39228367,Nucleic Acids Res

Mir-146a wild-type 3Ê¹ sequence identity is dispensable for proper innate immune function in vivo (miRNA-Seq),GSE125473,Mus musculus,A long-prevailing model has held that the âseedâ region (nucleotides 2-8) of a microRNA is typically sufficient to mediate target recognition and repression. However， numerous recent studies， both within the context of defining miRNA/target pairs by direct physical association and by directly assessing this model in vivo in C. elegans have brought this model into question. To test the importance of miRNA 3' pairing in vivo， in a mammalian system， we engineered a mutant murine mir-146a allele in which the 5' half of the mature microRNA retains the sequence of the wild-type mir-146a but the 3Ê¹ half has been altered to be anti-complementary to the wild-type miR-146a sequence. Mice homozygous or hemizygous for this mutant allele are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type controls and do not recapitulate any of the immunopathology previously described for mir-146a-null mice. Our results strongly support the conclusion that 3Ê¹ pairing is dispensable in the context of the function of a key mammalian microRNA.,Small-RNA expression profiling of resting bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from miR-146 wild-type (WT)， knock-out (KO) and non-seed swap (3'F) mice,30777858,Life Sci Alliance
Induction of T cell dysfunction and NK-like T cell differentiation in vitro and in patients after CAR T cell treatment [scRNA-seq KO],GSE189924,Homo sapiens,Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in hematological malignancies but remains largely ineffective in solid tumors. A major factor leading to the reduced efficacy of CAR T cell therapy is T cell dysfunction， and the mechanisms mediating this dysfunction are under investigation. Here we establish a robust in vitro model to study mesothelin-redirected CAR T cell dysfunction in pancreatic cancer. Continuous antigen exposure results in hallmark features of exhaustion including reduced proliferation capacity and cytotoxicity， and severe defects in cytokine production. Here we identified a transcriptional signature at both population and single-cell levels in CAR T cells after chronic antigen exposure. In addition， TCR lineage tracing revealed a CD8+ T-to-NK-like T cell plasticity that results in reduced antigen- dependent tumor cell killing. The transcription factors SOX4 and ID3 are specifically expressed in the dysfunctional CAR NK-like T cells and are predicted to be master regulators of the dysfunction gene expression signature and of the post-thymic acquisition of an NK-like T cell fate. Finally， we identified the emergence of CAR NK-like T cells in a subset of patients after infusion of CAR T cells. The findings gleaned from this study reveal new approaches to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors by preventing or revitalizing CAR T cell dysfunction and shed light on the plasticity of human CAR T cells.,Examines expression by single-cell RNA-seq in CD8+ T cells from two donors.

Spliced synthetic genes as internal controls in RNA sequencing experiments.,GSE77072,Homo sapiens;synthetic construct,RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to assemble spliced isoforms， quantify expressed genes and provide a global profile of the transcriptome. However， the size and diversity of the transcriptome， the wide dynamic range in gene expression and inherent technical biases confound RNA-seq analysis. We have developed a set of spike-in RNA standards， termed âsequinsâ (sequencing spike-ins)， that represent full-length spliced mRNA isoforms. Sequins have an entirely artificial sequence with no homology to natural reference genomes， but align to gene loci encoded on an artificial in silico chromosome. The combination of multiple sequins across a range of concentrations emulates alternative splicing and differential gene expression， and provides scaling factors for normalization between samples. We demonstrate the use of sequins in RNA-seq experiments to measure sample-specific biases and determine the limits of reliable transcript assembly and quantification in accompanying human RNA samples. In addition， we have designed a complementary set of sequins that represent fusion genes arising from rearrangements of the in silico chromosome to aid in cancer diagnosis. RNA sequins provide a qualitative and quantitative reference with which to navigate the complexity of the human transcriptome.,"Detailed transcriptomic analysis of two human cell lines with synthetic RNA spike-ins ('sequins'). Sequins were initially combined at equimolar concentrations (a ""flat"" mix) and sequenced neat (i.e. without any natural RNA added).

An environmentally-responsive transcriptional state modulates cell identities during root development,GSE198394,Arabidopsis thaliana,Roots are fundamental organs for plant development and response to their environment: they anchor the plant to its growth substrate， uptake nutrients and water vital to plant growth， and can sense and respond to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. The architecture of root systems and their growth are known to be strongly affected by the environmental conditions found in the soil. However， the acquisition of cell identities at the root meristem is still mainly viewed as ontogenetically driven， where a small number of stem cells generate all the cell types through stereotyped divisions followed by differentiation， along a simple developmental trajectory. The extent to which environmental cues precisely shape and affect these developmental trajectories remains an open question. We used single-cell RNA-seq， combined with spatial mapping， to deeply explore the trajectories of cell states at the tip of Arabidopsis roots， known to contain multiple developing lineages. Surprisingly， we found that most lineage trajectories exhibit a stereotyped bifid topology with two developmental trajectories rather than one. The formation of one of the trajectories is driven by a strong and specific activation of genes involved in the responses to various environmental stimuli， that affects only of a subset of the cells in multiple cell types simultaneously， revealing another layer of patterning of cell identities in the root that is independent of cell ontogeny. We demonstrate the robustness of this environmentally-responsive transcriptional state by showing that it is present in a mutant where cell type identities are greatly perturbed， as well as in different Arabidopsis ecotypes. We also show that the root can adapt the proportion of cells that acquire this particular state in response to environmental signals such as nutrient availability. The discovery of this transcriptional signature further highlights the adaptive potential of plant development.,Single cell RNA-seq profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana root tips from 5 wild-type accessions and the scr-3 mutant.

Coupled single-cell epigenome editing and profiling reveals causal gene regulatory networks [Perturb-ATAC (GBC/sgRNA)],GSE116285,Homo sapiens,Here we present Perturb-ATAC， a method which combines multiplexed CRISPR interference or knockout with genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling in single cells， based on the simultaneous detection of CRISPR guide RNAs and open chromatin sites by Assay of Transposase-accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). We applied Perturb-ATAC to transcription factors (TFs)， chromatin-modifying factors， and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in ~3，700 single cells， encompassing more than 75 unique genotype-phenotype relationships.,Single-cell epigenome and perturbation identification in lymphoblastoid cells and epidermal keratinocytes.,30580963,Cell
Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) supports the ESR1 action in breast cancer (ChIP-seq),GSE159724,Homo sapiens,Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a key regulator of transcriptional responses to proteotoxic stress. It has been recently linked to signaling of estrogen via ESR1. To study the cooperation of HSF1 and ESR1 in the transcriptional response to estrogen， we established estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines with reduced HSF1 levels using specific shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 approach. HSF1 deficiency led to the inhibition of the mitogenic effect of estrogen in MCF7 and T47D cells. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the stimulatory effect of E2 on the transcriptome was smaller in HSF1-deficient MCF7 cells. This could partially result from the higher basal expression of E2-dependent genes in these cells as a consequence of the enhanced binding of unliganded ESR1 to chromatin， which was revealed by ChIP-seq analyses. Thus， we postulate that some fraction of ESR1 could be released from the inhibitory complex with HSP90 and gain transcriptional competence without E2-stimulation.,We sequenced DNA immunoprecipitated from MCF7 cells variants with the normal level of HSF (WT and MIX) and in HSF1-deficient cells (KO#2)， using mouse monoclonal anti-ERÎ± antibody. Cells were untreated (control) or stimulated using estrogen (17beta-estradiol) for indicated time. Four ChIP biological replicates were collected and pooled per each sequenced sample. Input samples were included as negative control (no DNA enrichment was observed in mock-IP samples).,34783649,Elife
A genome-scale screen for synthetic drivers of T-cell proliferation,GSE193736,Escherichia coli;Homo sapiens,The engineering of patient T-cells for adoptive cell therapies has revolutionised the treatment of several cancer types. However， further improvements are needed to increase response and cure rates. CRISPR-based loss-of-function screens have been limited to negative regulators of T-cell functions and raise safety concerns due to permanent genome modification. Here we identify positive T-cell regulators via overexpression of ~12，000 barcoded human open reading frames (ORFs). The top-ranked genes increased primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation， activation， and secretion of key cytokines like interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. In addition， we developed a single-cell genomics method (OverCITE-seq) for high-throughput quantification of the transcriptome and surface antigens in ORF-engineered T-cells. The top-ranked ORF， lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR)， is typically expressed in myeloid cells but absent in lymphocytes. When overexpressed in T-cells， LTBR induced profound transcriptional and epigenomic remodelling， increasing T-cell effector functions， as well as resistance to exhaustion in chronic stimulation settings， via constitutive activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. LTBR and other top-ranked genes improved antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and gamma delta T-cell responses， highlighting their potential for future cancer-agnostic therapies5. Our results provide several strategies for improving next generation T-cell therapies via induction of new synthetic cell programmes.,Screen data: Primary T cells from three donors were transduced with a DNA barcoded ORF library. Best proliferating cells after restimulated were sorted and barcode abundance was compared to unsorted population. Single cell data: T cells overexpressing each ORF were separately transduced and cultured， and pooled only prior to the single cell experiment. Barcoded hashing antibodies were added for sample identification and overloading. Additionally， barcoded anti-NGFR antibody was added. In addition to transcriptome and TCR sequencing， direct ORF capture was performed. RNAseq: CD4 and CD8 T cells were transduced in triplicate with LTBR or tNGFR， and total RNA was extracted from resting or stimulated cells for 3' RNA sequencing in bulk. ATAC-seq: CD8 T cells were transduced in duplicate with LTBR  or tNGFR; T cells were either rested or stimulated with CD3/CD28 for 24 h prior to nuclei isolation and tagmentation.,35296855,Nature
Notch induces transcription by stimulating release of paused RNA Pol II without increasing chromatin accessibility [ChIP-seq],GSE269113,Homo sapiens,Notch proteins undergo ligand-induced proteolysis to release a nuclear effector that influences a wide range of cell fate decisions by regulating gene activity. However， despite years of study， how Notch induces the transcription of its target genes remains unclear. Here， we comprehensively examined the response to human Notch1 across a time course of activation， using genomic assays of nascent RNA and chromatin accessibility. These data revealed that Notch induces target gene transcription primarily by releasing paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)， in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that Notch acts by promoting chromatin accessibility. Indeed， we found that open chromatin is established at Notch-responsive regulatory elements prior to Notch signaling， through SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling. Notch activation， however， elicited no further chromatin opening at these loci. Together， these studies reveal that the nuclear response to Notch signaling is dictated by the pre-existing chromatin state and RNAPII distribution at the time of signal activation.,Notch signaling was induced in SC2 cells by GSI washout， and cells were harvested at 15m， 30m， 45m， 1h， 90m， 2h， and 4h after Notch induction， and chromatin was prepared from these samples. Chromatin was also prepared from cells harvested at 0h， immediately post mock GSI washout， as a reference condition. ChIP-seq was performed for the H3K27ac chromatin mark. There are 10total conditions， and two replicates of the full experiment.,nan,

Fine Resolution Mapping of TF binding and Chromatin  Interactions,GSE108948,Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Mus musculus,Monitoring the location of transcription factors (TFs) binding to DNA is key to understanding  transcriptional regulation. The main tool for mapping TF binding is ChIP-seq and its variants.  However， current ChIP-based methods are hampered by at least one of the following limitations:  large input requirements， low spatial resolution， and limited compatibility with high-throughput  automation. Here， we describe SLIM-ChIP (Short fragment enriched， Low input， Indexed，  MNase ChIP)， which overcomes these challenges by combining enzymatic fragmentation of  chromatin and on-bead indexing of immobilized TF-DNA complexes. We show that SLIM-ChIP  reproduces high resolution binding map of yeast Reb1 similarly to the high-resolution TF  mapping methods ChIP-exo and ORGANIC. Yet， SLIM-ChIP requires substantially less input  material， and is fully compatible with high-throughput procedures. We further demonstrate the  robustness and flexibility of SLIM-ChIP by probing Abf1 and Rap1 in yeast and CTCF in mouse  embryonic stem cells. Finally， we show that the unique combination of high resolution and  preservation of DNA protection patterns by SLIM-ChIP provide an additional layer of information  on the chromatin landscape surrounding the bound TF. We used this information to identify a  class of Reb1 sites in which the proximal -1 nucleosome tightly interacts with Reb1 and unlike  in most Reb1 sites is refractory to remodeling by the RSC complex. Importantly， the interaction  of Reb1 with the -1 nucleosome prevents transcription initiation and can serve as a more  general mechanism for maintaining unidirectional transcription. Altogether， SLIM-ChIP is an  attractive solution for mapping DNA binding proteins in a more informative context regarding  their surrounding chromatin occupancy landscape at a single cell level.,The dataset includes several ChIP-Seq experiments of yeast and mouse ESCs transcription factors.  Reb1 (yeast) ChIP was performed in several Mnase levels and different numbers of input cells (five samples overall). Mouse CTCF ChIP was performed in several Mnase levels (five samples overall). Abf1 and Rap1 (yeast) were mapped using a mix of different Mnase levels (one sample each).,29514105,Cell Rep
Role of TAF5L and TAF6L in controlling the mouse ESC state [RNA-seq],GSE113329,Mus musculus,Self-renewal and pluripotency of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state is established and maintained by multiple regulatory networks that comprise transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Although many studies have been performed， the function of epigenetic regulators in these networks is incompletely defined. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated loss-of-function genetic screen to target 323 epigenetic and ESC-specific transcription factor genes. This screen identified two new epigenetic regulatorsâTAF5L and TAF6Lâwith high confidence for the mouse ESC state. TAF5L and TAF6L are also essential for the efficient somatic reprogramming. In-depth analyses demonstrate that TAF5L and TAF6L belong to and establish a regulatory circuitry with MYC and CORE networks. Moreover， detailed molecular studies reveal TAF5L and TAF6L predominantly regulate their target genes through the c-MYC and MYC regulatory network to control self-renewal of mouse ESCs. Our findings illuminate the multi-layered regulatory networks of TAF5L and TAF6L for gene regulation to maintain the ESC state.,RNA-seq gene expression comparison between WT mouse embryonic stem cells and Taf5l/Taf6l knockouts， as well as between c-Myc knockout and WT.,31005419,Mol Cell
Amplification-based expression data show bias towards long gene misregulation in synaptic disorders,GSE94073,Homo sapiens,Several recent studies have suggested that genes that are over 100 kb in length are particularly likely to be misregulated in neurological diseases associated with synaptic dysfunction， such as autism， Fragile X syndrome， and Rett syndrome. These length-dependent transcriptional changes seem to be modest， but， given the low sensitivity of high-throughput transcriptome profiling technology， the statistical significance of these results needs to be reevaluated. Here we show that transcriptional changes reflected in microarray and RNA-Sequencing benchmark datasets from the SEQC Consortium show a bias toward genes of greater length， even in the comparison of technical replicates. We hypothesized that PCR amplification， which is used in both microarray and RNA-Seq technologies， could be introducing this bias. We found that， when the fold-change values are small， PCR amplification in microarray and RNA-Seq technologies does produce a bias toward longer genes; we found no similar bias with nCounter technology， which is not based on PCR amplification. We provide an approach to more rigorously assess length-dependent changes that begins with comparing randomized control samples to estimate baseline gene length dependency and evaluate the statistical significance of gene length regulation.,We purchased Universal Human Reference RNA from Agilent Technologies， Inc.， and Human Brain Reference RNA from Life Technologies， Inc. For the nCounter experiments， we used the same RNA sample types as SEQC. We assessed RNA purity and integrity with Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies， Inc.) prior to use in the nCounter assays.

Interplay between Nsd1 and PRC2 demarcates regions of H3K27me2 and H3K27me3.,GSE107773,Mus musculus,The core Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) is composed of Ezh1/2， Suz12， Eed and is responsible for mediating both H3K27me2 and H3K27me3. However， the mechanisms by which PRC2 demarcates these two repressive modifications in the genome are unknown. In a functional screen， we identified the H3K36 dimethyltransferase Nsd1 as a modulator of PRC2-mediated di- and trimethylation of H3K27. ChIP-Seq analysis following the depletion of Nsd1 revealed a global reduction in H3K36me2 and an increase in H3K27me3 at sites previously marked by H3K27me2. We show that the H3K36me2 at H3K27me2 marks co-occupy regions and provide evidence that the presence of H3K36me2 functions to restrict the spatial distribution of Polycomb mediated H3K27me3 domains.,Immuno-precipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin prepared from mouse embryonic stem cells transduced with shRNA targeting Nsd1 (pLKO.TRC1shNsd1.1 and pLKO.TRC1shNsd1.2) and non-targeting control shRNA (pLKO.TRC1shLuciferase).

Extensive cellular heterogeneity of X inactivation revealed by single-cell allele-specific expression in human fibroblasts,GSE123028,Homo sapiens,X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) provides a dosage compensation mechanism where， in each female cell， one of the two X chromosomes is randomly silenced. However， some genes on the inactive X  chromosome and outside the pseudoautosomal regions escape from XCI and are expressed from both alleles (escapees). We investigated XCI at single-cell resolution combining deep single cellRNA sequencing with whole-genome sequencing to examine allelic-specific expression in 935 primary fibroblast and 48 lymphoblastoid single cells from five female individuals. In this framework we integrated an original method to identify and exclude doublets of cells. In fibroblast cells， we have identified 55 genes as escapees including five novel escapee genes. Moreover， we observed that all genes exhibit a variable propensity to escape XCI in each cell and cell type and that each cell displays a distinct expression profile of the escapee genes. A metric， the Inactivation Scoreâdefined as the mean of the allelic expression profiles of the escapees per cellâenables us to discover a heterogeneous and continuous degree of cellular XCI with extremes represented by âinactiveâ cells， i.e.， cells exclusively expressing the escaping genes from the active X chromosome and âescapingâ cells expressing the escapees from both alleles.

Diverse reprogramming codes for neuronal identity,GSE112381,Mus musculus,The transcriptional programs that establish neuronal identity evolved to produce a rich diversity of neuronal cell types that arise sequentially during development. Remarkably， transient expression of certain transcription factors (TFs) can also endow non-neural cells with neuronal properties. To decipher the relationship between reprogramming factors and transcriptional networks that produce neuronal identity and diversity， we screened ~600 TF pairs and identified 76 that produce induced neurons (iNs) from fibroblasts. By intersecting the transcriptomes of iNs with those of endogenous neurons， we define a âcoreâ cell-autonomous neuronal signature. The iNs also exhibit diversity; each TF pair produces iNs with unique transcriptional patterns that can predict their pharmacological responses. By linking distinct TF input âcodesâ to defined transcriptional outputs， this study uncovers cell autonomous features of neuronal identity and expands the reprogramming toolbox to enable more facile engineering of induced neurons with desired patterns of gene expression and related functional properties.,RNA-Seq profiles for 35 TauEGFP-positive induced neuron populations， 1 embryonic fibroblast population， and 7 endogenous neural populations in biological duplicates. 2 endogenous neural populations were sequenced in biological triplicates.

Screening thousands of transcribed coding and non-coding regions reveals sequence determinants of RNA polymerase II elongation potential.,GSE178230,Mus musculusOrganismal growth and development rely on RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) synthesizing the appropriate repertoire of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from protein-coding genes. Productive elongation of full-length transcripts is essential for mRNA function， however what determines whether an engaged RNAPII molecule will terminate prematurely or transcribe processively remains poorly understood. Notably， despite a common process for transcription initiation across RNAPII-synthesized RNAs1， RNAPII is highly susceptible to termination when transcribing non-coding RNAs such as upstream antisense RNAs (uaRNAs) and enhancers RNAs (eRNAs)2， suggesting that differences arise during RNAPII elongation. To investigate the impact of transcribed sequence on elongation potential， we developed a method to screen the effects of thousands of INtegrated Sequences on Expression of RNA and Translation using high-throughput sequencing (INSERT-seq). We found that higher AT content in uaRNAs and eRNAs， rather than specific sequence motifs， underlies the propensity for RNAPII termination on these transcripts. Further， we demonstrate that 5â splice sites exert both splicing-dependent and autonomous， splicing-independent stimulation of processive transcription， even in the absence of polyadenylation signals.

Our study provides a rich resource for understanding the functional states and regulatory dynamics of immune cells in RCC.Â,We used single cell RNA-seq (5' RNA expression sequencing)  and TCR-sequencing (VDJ sequencing)  of human immune cells from blood， normal adjacent kidney， and malignant tissues from early stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients at baseline.

3'-TARGET-seq: a novel method for high-sensitivity single-cell mutational analysis and parallel high throughput RNA-sequencing [Figures 5 and 6， Figure S7],GSE122198,Homo sapiens,We developed 3'-TARGET-seq， a single-cell genotyping and RNA-seq method， which allows accurate detection of multiple mutations within single-cells from genomic and coding DNA in parallel with high throughput 3'-biased whole transcriptome analysis， providing a powerful tool to link transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity. Single cell whole transcriptome sequencing of 2798 Lineage-CD34+ HSPC (Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells) from patients with JAK2-V617F mutant myelofibrosis and normal controls using 3'-TARGET-seq reveals distinct molecular signatures associated with the presence of somatic mutations in single cells as well as distinct transcriptional profiles of WT cells from patient samples as compared with normal controls.,We isolated single HSPCs from patients with JAK2V617F mutant myelofibrosis patient samples and aged-matched normal controls and processed them using 3'-TARGET-seq， a novel method for parallel mutational analysis and high throughput whole transcriptome sequencing from the same single cell. We analyzed a cohort of patients with  JAK2-V617F mutation and several cooperating mutations in spliceosome components (SF3B1， U2AF1， SRSF2)， epigenetic modifiers (TET2， ASXL1) and signalling genes (CBL). We performed differential expression analysis between different genetic subclones from multiple patients as well as cells obtained from normal donors. We also analyzed molecular signatures corresponding to every combination of mutations found in single cells as well as molecular signatures of WT cells from patient samples as compared to WT cells from normal controls.,30765193,Mol Cell
Lipolysis regulates major transcriptional programs in brown adipocytes [3Dcultured_eWAs_RNA-seq],GSE202834,Mus musculus,Î²-Adrenergic signaling is a core regulator of brown adipocyte function stimulating both lipolysis and transcription of thermogenic genes， thereby expanding the capacity for oxidative metabolism. Here we have used pharmacological inhibitors and a novel direct activator of lipolysis to acutely modulate the activity of lipases， thereby enabling us to uncover lipolysis-dependent signaling pathways downstream of Î²-adrenergic signaling in brown adipocytes. We show that induction of lipolysis leads to acute induction of several gene programs and is required for transcriptional regulation by Î²-adrenergic signals. Using machine-learning algorithms to infer causal transcription factors， we show that PPARs are key mediators of lipolysis-induced activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis. Importantly， lipolysis also activates the unfolded protein response and regulates the core circadian transcriptional machinery independently of PPARs. Our results demonstrate that lipolysis generates important metabolic signals that exert profound pleiotropic effects on brown adipocyte transcription and function.,Isolated epididymal white adipocytes with ISO for 3 hrs in the presence and absence of lipase inhibitors and determined the effect on the transcriptome by RNA-seq analysis. Subsequently， we stimulated the mature brown adipocytes with SR-3420 for 3hrs and harvsted for RNA for RNAsequencing.,35803907,Nat Commun
Transcriptional regulation of cellular mechanosignaling by PREP1 (PKNOX1),GSE160286,Homo sapiens,Mechanosignaling， initiated by the extracellular physical forces and propagated through the intracellular cytoskeletal network， triggers signaling cascades leading to processes such as embryogenesis， tissue maintenance and disease development. While signal transduction by transcription factors occurs downstream of cellular mechanosensing， nothing is known about the cell intrinsic mechanisms that can regulate mechanosignaling.  Here we show that transcription factor PREP1 (PKNOX1) regulates the expression of LINC complex proteins and mechanotransduction of YAP-TAZ. PREP1 depletion upsets the nuclear membrane protein stoichiometry rendering nuclei soft. However， reduced nuclear tension is not conveyed to the cytoplasm， since these cells display fortified actomyosin network with bigger focal adhesion complexes resulting in greater traction forces at the substratum. Intriguingly， YAP-TAZ remains localized to the cytoplasm irrespective of the substrate rigidity indicating disrupted mechanotransduction. Our data demonstrate a hitherto unknown transcriptional mechanism which regulate mechanosignaling upstream of YAP-TAZ transduction.,Chip-seq analysis of Prep1 (pknox1) binding profiles in human cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells,35550602,Commun Biol

Two batches of replicates were generated for each condition. batch 1 has two replicates for each of the three conditions， and batch2 has three replicates for two conditions (siControl and siSbsn). The comparison between siSbsn vs siControl was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes.,29899432,Sci Rep
Single-cell RNA sequencing-based CRISPRi screening resolves molecular drivers of early human endoderm development [set 2],GSE127201,Homo sapiens,Studies in vertebrates have outlined conserved molecular control of definitive endoderm (END) development. Yet， recent work also shows that key molecular aspects of human END regulation differ even from rodents. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to END offers a tractable system to study the molecular basis of normal and defective human-specific END development. Here， we interrogated dynamics in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of hPSCs to END， predicting DNA-binding proteins that may drive this cell fate transition. We then combined single-cell RNA-seq with parallel CRISPR-perturbations to comprehensively define the loss-of-function phenotype of those factors in END development. Following a few candidates， we revealed distinct impairments in the differentiation trajectories for mediators of TGFÎ² signaling and expose a role for the FOXA2 transcription factor in priming human END competence for human foregut and hepatic endoderm specification.

Computational identification of clonal cells in single-cell CRISPR screens,GSE185995,Homo sapiens,Single-cell CRISPR screens are powerful tools to understand genome function by linking genetic perturbations to transcriptome-wide phenotypes. However， since few cells can be affordably sequenced in these screens， biased sampling of cells could affect data interpretation. One potential source of biased sampling is clonal cell expansion. Here， we present a computational pipeline for clonal cell identification in single cell screens using multiplexed sgRNA barcodes. We find that the cells in each clone share transcriptional similarities and we infer the segmental copy number changes in clonal cells. These analyses suggest that clones are genetically distinct. Finally， we show that the transcriptional similarities of clonally expanded cells contribute to false positives in single-cell CRISPR screens. As a result， experimental conditions that reduce clonal expansion or computational filtering of clonal cells will improve the reliability of single-cell CRISPR screens.,We performed single-cell CRISPR screen on 2045 enhancers in MDA-MB-231 cells. We used 10X genomics 3â V3 kit and Cell Hashing staining to prepare the single-cell transcriptome libraries. The sgRNA is expressed by using the CROP-seq design， and a sgRNA enrichment library was also prepared for each single-cell library. In total， we performed six 10X runs， with a total number of 50000 singlets. For the processed data， we uploaded the gene expression matrix (HDF5 format) from 10X cellranger pipeline in together with the sgRNA information and Cell Hashing information of each cell.,35168568,BMC Genomics
Transcriptomic analysis of wild type and Del(Hotair)-/- mouse tissues,GSE79028,Mus musculus,Despite decades of interest， the mechanisms that control Hox gene expression are not yet fully understood. It was recently proposed that Hotair， a lncRNA transcribed from the HoxC cluster， regulates HoxD gene expression via Polycomb targeting and thus is important for correct skeletal development. However， genetic manipulations of the locus led to conflicting results regarding the roles of Hotair. Here， we analyze the molecular and phenotypic consequences of deleting the Hotair locus in vivo. In contradiction with previous findings， we show that deleting Hotair has no detectable effect on HoxD gene expression in vivo. We could not observe any morphological alteration in mice lacking the Hotair locus. However， we find a significant impact of deleting Hotair on the expression of neighboring genes Hoxc11 and Hoxc12. Our results do not support an RNA-dependent role for Hotair in vivo， but argue in favor of a DNA-dependent effect of Hotair deletion on the transcriptional landscape in cis.,We micro-dissected wild type and Del(Hotair)-/- E12.5 embryos into 6 segments: forelimbs (FL)， hindlimbs (HL)， genital tubercle (GT)， trunk section corresponding to the lumbar/sacral region (T1); trunk section corresponding to the sacral/caudal region (T2) and trunk section corresponding to the caudal region (T3). We generated strand-specific RNA-seq data for each segment， in two biological replicates and we performed differential expression analyses for each tissue. Furthermore， we analyzed the impact of deleting the Hotair locus on the local transcriptional landscape， in the HoxC cluster.,27977683,PLoS Genet

Opposing roles for the lncRNA Haunt and its genomic locus in regulating HOXA gene activation during embryonic stem cell differentiation,GSE58514,Mus musculus,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in controlling various aspects of embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology， although the functions of specific lncRNAs， and the molecular mechanisms through which they act， remain unclear. Here， we demonstrate discrete and opposing roles for the lncRNA transcript Haunt and its genomic locus in regulating the HOXA gene cluster during ESC differentiation. Reducing or enhancing Haunt expression， with minimal disruption of the Haunt locus， led to up- or down-regulation of HOXA genes， respectively. In contrast， increasingly large genomic deletions within the Haunt locus attenuated HOXA activation. The Haunt DNA locus contains potential enhancers of HOXA activation， whereas Haunt RNA acts to prevent aberrant HOXA expression. This work reveals a multi-faceted model of lncRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of the HOXA cluster， with distinct roles for a lncRNA transcript and its genomic locus， while illustrating the power of rapid CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing for assigning lncRNA functions.,All RNA-seq(s) were designed to reveal the differentially expressed genes among different stages of ESCs differentiation， or differentially expressed genes between wild-type or Haunt or HOXA mutant cells during RA-induced differentiation. All ChIRP-Seq were used to reveal the DNA or RNA targets of Haunt before or after RA treatment.,25891907,Cell Stem Cell

Identification of miR-29b targets using 3-cyanovinylcarbazole containing mimics - human,GSE120763,Homo sapiens,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved â¼22 nt small noncoding RNAs that bind partially complementary sequences in target transcripts. MicroRNAs regulate both translation and transcript stability， and play important roles in development， cellular homeostasis， and disease. There are limited approaches available to agnostically identify microRNA targets transcriptome-wide， and methods using miRNA mimics， which in principle identify direct miRNA:transcript pairs， have low sensitivity and specificity. Here， we describe a novel method to identify microRNA targets using miR-29b mimics containing 3cyanovinylcarbazole ( CNV K)， a photolabile nucleoside analog. We demonstrate that biotin-tagged， CNV K-containing miR-29b ( CNV K-miR-29b) mimics are nontoxic in cell culture， associate with endogenous mammalian Argonaute2， arehighly sensitive for known targets and recapitulate endogenous transcript destabilization. Partnering CNV K-miR-29b with ultra-low-input RNA sequencing， we recover â¼40% of known miR-29b targets and findrobust conservation of the focal adhesion and apoptotic target pathways in mouse and human. We also identify hundreds of novel targets， including NRAS， HOXA10， and KLF11， with a validation rate of 71% for a subset of 73 novel target transcripts interrogated using a high-throughput luciferase assay. Consistent with previous reports， we show that both endogenous miR-29b and CNV K-miR-29b are trafficked to the nucleus， but find no evidence of nuclear-specific miR-29b transcript binding. This may indicate that miR-29b nuclear sequestration is a regulatory mechanism in itself. We suggest that CNV K-containing small RNA mimics may find applicability in other experimental models,pulldown assay with 3x3x3x3 design: miRNA mimic and scrambled miRNA mimic x input and pulldown conditions,29246928,RNA

Systematic functional characterization of BAF mutations yields novel intra-complex synthetic lethalities [RNA-Seq],GSE108388,Homo sapiens,Aberrations in genes coding for subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex are highly abundant in human cancers. Currently， it is not understood how these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cancer development and how they can be targeted therapeutically. The cancer type specific occurrence patterns of certain subunit mutations suggest subunit-specific effects on BAF complex function， possibly by the formation of aberrant residual complexes. Here， we systematically characterize the effects of individual subunit loss on complex composition， chromatin accessibility and gene expression in a panel of knock-out cell lines deficient for 22 targetable BAF subunits.

Direct full-length RNA sequencing reveals unexpected transcriptome complexity during C. elegans development,GSE130044,Caenorhabditis elegans,High throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using cDNA has played a key role in delineating transcriptome complexity， including alternative transcription initiation， splicing， polyadenylation and base modification. However， the reads derived from current RNA-seq technologies are usually short and deprived of information on modification during reverse transcription， compromising their potential in defining transcriptome complexity. Here we applied a direct RNA sequencing method with ultra-long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to study the transcriptome complexity in C. elegans. We sequenced native poly-A tailed mRNAs by generating approximately six million reads from embryos， L1 larvae and young adult animals， with average read lengths ranging from 900 to 1，100 bps across stages. Around half of the reads represent full-length transcripts， judged by the presence of a splicing-leader or their full coverage of an existing transcript. To take advantage of the full-length transcripts in defining transcriptome complexity， we devised a novel algorithm to predict novel isoforms or group them with exiting isoforms using their mapping tracks rather than the existing intron/exon structures， which allowed us to identify roughly 57，000 novel isoforms and recover at least 26，000 out of the 33，500 existing isoforms. Intriguingly， stage-specific expression at the level of gene and isoform demonstrates little correlation. Finally， we observed an elevated level of modification in all bases in the coding region relative to the UTR. Taken together， the ONT long reads are expected to deliver new insights into RNA processing and modification and their underlying biology.,Animals of different stages， i.e.， embryo， L1 larva and young adult， were collected and total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturerâs instructions. Approximately 100 Âµg total RNAs were extracted for each sample. Around 900 ng of poly-A tailed mRNAs was purified using Dynabeadsâ¢ mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen) based on the userâs manual for each library preparation. Nanopore sequencing libraries were constructed using Direct RNA sequencing kit (cat# SQK-RNA001). The libraries were loaded onto Nanopore R9.4.1 flow cell (cat# FLO-MIN106) and sequenced on MinION acquired from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

Perivascular signals alter global genomic profile of glioblastoma and response to temozolomide in a gelatin hydrogel,GSE111231,Homo sapiens,Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor， with patients exhibiting poor survival (median survival time: 15 months). Difficulties in treating GBM include not only the inability to resect the diffusively-invading tumor cells but also therapeutic resistance. The perivascular niche within the GBM tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor cell invasion， cancer stem cell maintenance， and has been shown to protect tumor cells from radiation and chemotherapy. In this study， we describe the development of an in vitro artificial perivascular niche (PVN)， culturing endothelial and stromal cells along with GBM cells within a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin hydrogel， in order to examine how the presence of the PVN alters global genomic expression profiles. Using RNA-seq， we demonstrate that the inclusion of perivascular niche cells with GBM cells upregulates genes related to angiogenesis and remodeling， while downregulated genes are related to cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Signaling pathways and genes commonly implicated in GBM malignancy， such as MGMT， EGFR， PI3K-Akt signaling， and Ras/MAPK signaling are also upregulated in the presence of perivascular niche cells. We describe the kinetics of gene expression within the PVN hydrogels over a course of 14 days， observing the patterns associated with previously-observed GBM-mediated endothelial network co-option and regression that are altered in the presence of covalently-bound hyaluronic acid. We finally examine the effect of PVN culture on GBM cell responsiveness to temozolomide， a frontline chemotherapy used clinically against GBM. Notably， the presence of a PVN leads to significantly increased TMZ resistance compared to hydrogels containing only GBM cells. Overall， these results demonstrate that inclusion of cellular and matrix-associated elements of the PVN within in vitro models of GBM provide critical signals to regulate the phenotype and therapeutic responsiveness of GBM cells.,Tri-Culture RNA samples were compared to Mixed Culture RNA samples. RNA for Tri-Culture groups was extracted from methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogels containing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)， normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs)， and U87-MG cells cultured together. For Mixed samples， RNA from GelMA hydrogels containing only U87-MG cells was mixed with RNA from GelMA hydrogels containing HUVECs and NHLFs cultured together， such that the fraction of RNA belonging to NHLFs was equivalent between Tri-Culture and Mixed samples.

Time series of Methanococcus maripaludis MM901:del_MMP0719， a shift from a H2-excess and P-limiting condition to a H2-limited and P-excess condition in chemostats (growth rate held constant),GSE42159,Methanococcus maripaludis S2,Methanogens catalyze the critical， methane-producing step (called methanogenesis) in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and have applications in carbon-neutral fuel production. Here， we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen， Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and non-coding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network (EGRIN) model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 100 different steady-state and time course experiments that were performed in chemostats， or batch cultures， under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to inter-coordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility， ATP biosynthesis， and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the EGRIN-predicted role of two novel TFs in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydorgenase â a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway.,The strain was grown by continuous culture in a one-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific， Edison， NJ) at 37Â°C (FEMS Microbiol Lett 238: 85-91， 2004). Medium and gas compositions were modified from those for non-limiting conditions (BMC Microbiol 9: 149， 2009).   Growth conditions were carefully designed to separate the effects of different environmental factors. To ensure physico-chemical factors being constant， all cell cultures were performed using continuous cultivations with a constant dilution rate. The standard gassing regime was 110 mL/min H2， 40 mL/min CO2， 35 mL/min Ar， and 15 mL/min H2S/Ar mixture (1:99). For shifts from a H2 excess to a H2 limited condition， H2 was lowered from standard 110 mL/min to 21 mL/min and Ar was raised from standard 35 mL/min to 125 mL/min. For shifts from P-limited to P-excess conditions， phosphate was raised from 0.12 mM to the standard 0.8 mM. The dilution rate was held constant at 0.083 h-1. For time-series array data， cultures before perturbation were allowed to reach steady state. We rapidly changed concentration(s) of H2 and/or a nutrient， and sampled at intervals after the perturbation; right away， after 5 mins， 10， 20， 30， 45， 60， 90， 120， 180， and 300 mins. Culture samples (1.5 mL) were rapidly removed from the chemostat vessels by syringe and cell pellets collected by microcentrifugation， immediately frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath， and stored at -80Â°C.  Total RNA from each sample was compared against a reference RNA pool that was generated in bulk from a mid-log phase culture of MM901. Total RNA from samples and reference were directly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5， and were hybridized to the tiling array. After hybridization and washing according to array manufacturer's instructions， the arrays were scanned by Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies， Santa Clara， CA). Dye-flip experiments were done for each sample.,24089473,Genome Res
Drug combination sci-Plex Data,GSE206741,Homo sapiens,Recent advances in multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics experiments are facilitating the high-throughput study of drug and genetic perturbations. However， an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible， so computational methods are needed to predict， interpret， and prioritize perturbations. Here， we present the compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA)， which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep-learning  approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA encodes and learns transcriptional drug responses across different cell type， dose， and drug combinations. The model produces easy-to-interpret embeddings for drugs and cell types， which enables drug similarity analysis and predictions for unseen dosage and drug combinations. We show that CPA accurately models single-cell perturbations across compounds， doses， species， and time. We further demonstrate that CPA predicts combinatorial genetic interactions of several types， implying that it captures features that distinguish different interaction programs. Finally， we demonstrate that CPA can generate in-silico 5，329 missing genetic combination perturbations ($97.6% of all possibilities) with diverse genetic interactions. We envision our model will facilitate efficient experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in-silico response prediction at the single-cell level， and thus accelerate therapeutic applications using single-cell technologies.,Drug treatments were performed in triplicate including controls matching prior study (Srivatsan， 2020),37154091,Mol Syst Biol
Remapping the SRA: Drosophila melanogaster RNA-Seq data from the Sequence Read Archive,GSE117217,Drosophila melanogaster,The sequence read archive (SRA) contains over 52 terabases or 482 billion reads from Drosophila melanogaster (as of June 2018). These data are massively underused by the community and include 14，423 RNA-Seq samples， that is roughly 7 times the size of modENCODE. Currently the major challenge is finding high quality datasets that are suitable for inclusion in new studies. To help the community overcome this hurdle， we re-processed all D. melanogaster RNA-Seq SRA experiments (SRXs) using an identical workflow. This workflow uses a data driven approach to identify technical metadata (i.e.， strandedness and layout) for each sample in order to optimize mapping parameters. The workflow generates QC metrics， coverage tracks based on the dm6 assembly， and calculates gene level， junction level， and intergenic counts against FlyBase r6.11. Â This resource will allow any researcher to visualize browser tracks for any publicly available dataset， quickly identify high quality data sets for use in their own research， and download identically processed counts tables. There is a treasure trove of underused data sitting in the SRA and this work addresses the first challenge to make data integration a common laboratory practice.,Published Drosophila melanogaster RNA-seq data were re-mapped to dm6 and processed with an identical work flow.,37232385,Brief Bioinform
Ectopic CTCFL/BORISÂ expressionÂ in ovarian cancer precursor cells enhancesÂ cellular motility and invasion through GALNT14 and altersÂ CTCF chromatin occupancy,GSE131931,Homo sapiens,High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most aggressive and predominant form of epithelial ovarian cancer and the leading cause of gynecological cancer death. We have previously shown that CTCFL (also known as BORIS， Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites) is expressed in a large proportion of ovarian cancers， which is associated with global and promoter-specific DNA hypomethylation， advanced tumor stage， and poor prognosis. To explore its functional role in HGSC， we expressed BORIS in human fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSEC)， the presumptive cell of origin for HGSC. BORIS-expressing cells exhibited increased motility and invasion， and BORIS expression was associated with alterations in several cancer-associated gene expression networks， including fatty acid metabolism， TNF signaling， cell migration， and ECM-receptor interactions. Importantly， GALNT14， a glycosyltransferase gene previously implicated in cancer cell migration and invasion， was highly induced by BORIS， and GALNT14 knockdown significantly abrogated BORIS-induced cell motility and invasion.  In addition， in silico analyses provided evidence for BORIS and GALNT14 co-expression in several human cancers.  Finally， ChIP-seq demonstrated that expression of BORIS in FTSEC cells was associated with de novo and enhanced binding of CTCF at hundreds of loci， many of which correlated with activation of transcription at target genes， including GALNT14. Taken together， our data indicate that BORIS may promote cell motility and invasion in HGSC via upregulation of GALNT14， and suggests BORIS as a potential therapeutic target in this malignancy.,Genome-wide mapping of CTCF and BORIS occupancy in FT282 cells ectopically expressed either EV (Empty Vector) or BORIS.Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) of FT282 cells ectopically expressed either EV (Empty Vector) or BORIS.,31292201,Mol Cancer Res
MOWChIP-seq for low-input and high-throughput profiling of genome-wide histone modifications,GSE123606,Mus musculus,Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and DNA methylation form a critical layer of control that regulates gene activities. Histone modifications play critical roles in adaptive tuning of chromatin structures. Profiling various histone modifications at the genome scale using primary tissues from animal and human samples is an important step for functional studies of epigenomes and epigenomics-based precision medicine. Because the profile of a histone mark is highly specific to a particular cell type， isolation of a cell type of interest from primary tissues is often necessary to generate a homogeneous cell population and such operation tends to yield a low number of cells. In addition， high-throughput processing is desired in such effort due to the number of histone marks of interests and the potential volume of samples in a hospital setting. In this protocol， we describe detailed information on device fabrication， setup， and operation of microfluidic oscillatory washing-based chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MOWChIP-seq) for profiling histone modifications using as few as 30-100 cells per assay with a throughput as high as 8 assays in a run. The critical step of MOWChIP-seq operation involves flowing of chromatin fragments through a packed bed of antibody-coated beads followed by a vigorous microfluidic oscillatory washing. The ChIP process is semi-automated for reduced labor and improved reproducibility. We have used the protocol to study a number of histone modifications in various types of mouse and human tissue types ranging from isolated nuclei of brain cells to cell subtypes isolated from human breast tissues.,We examined genome-wide H3K9me3， H3K36me3， H3K79me2 profiles of nuclei isolated from mouse prefrontal cortex， 1000 nuclei per assay.

Genome-wide mapping of Collier in vivo binding sites highlights its hierarchical position in different transcription regulatory networks,GSE67805,Drosophila melanogaster,Collier， the single Drosophila COE (Collier/EBF/Olf-1) transcription factor， is required in several developmental processes， including head patterning and specification of muscle and neuron identity during embryogenesis. To identify direct Collier (Col) targets in different cell types， we used ChIP-seq to map Col binding sites throughout the genome， at mid-embryogenesis. In vivo Col binding peaks were associated to 415 potential direct target genes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed a strong enrichment in proteins with DNA binding and/or transcription-regulatory properties. Characterization of a selection of candidates， using transgenic CRM-reporter assays， identified direct Col targets in dorso-lateral somatic muscles and specific neuron types in the central nervous system. These data brought new evidence that Col direct control of the expression of the transcription regulators apterous  and eyes-absent (eya) is critical to specifying neuronal identities. They also showed that cross-regulation between col and eya in muscle progenitor cells is required for specification of muscle identity， revealing a new parallel between the myogenic regulatory networks operating in Drosophila and vertebrates. Col regulation of eya， both in specific muscle and neuronal lineages， may illustrate one mechanism behind the evolutionary diversification of Col biological roles.,Fixed nuclear extract of stage 13-14 whole drosophila embryo were submit to Chromatine Immunoprecipitation with a mix of three COL monoclonal antibodies. As control a non relevent antibody (anti-HA) was used. Precipitated DNA was submit to Illumina high-throughput sequencing.,26204530,PLoS One

Dynamic profiling of the protein life cycle in response to pathogens (RNA-seq),GSE59784,Mus musculus,Protein expression is regulated by production and degradation of mRNAs and proteins， but their specific relationships remain unknown. We combine measurements of protein production and degradation and mRNA dynamics to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in LPS stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely， the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation， accounting for over half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. Thus， the proteome is regulated by transcriptional induction of novel cellular functions and remodeling of preexisting functions through the protein life cycle.,Mouse primary dendritic cells were treated with LPS or mock stimulus and profiled over a 12-hour time course. Cells were grown in M-labeled SILAC media， which was replaced with H-labeled SILAC media at time 0.

Heat Shock Factor 1 drives intergenic association of its target gene loci during heat shock,GSE122666,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Transcriptional induction of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes in yeast is accompanied by dynamic changes in their 3D structure and spatial organization， yet the molecular basis for these phenomena remains unknown. Using chromosome conformation capture and single cell imaging， we show that genes transcriptionally activated by Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) specifically interact across chromosomes and coalesce into diffraction-limited intranuclear foci. Genes activated by the alternative stress regulators Msn2 and Msn4， in contrast， do not interact among themselves nor with Hsf1 targets.Likewise， constitutively expressed genes， even those interposed between HSP genes， show no detectable interaction. Hsf1 forms discrete subnuclear puncta when stressactivated， and these puncta dissolve in concert with transcriptional attenuation， paralleling the kinetics of HSP gene coalescence and dissolution. Nuclear Hsf1 and RNA Pol II are both necessary for intergenic HSP gene interactions， while DNA-bound Hsf1 is necessary and sufficient to drive coalescence of a heterologous gene. Our findings demonstrate that Hsf1 can dynamically restructure the yeast genome.,4 yeast RNA seq samples;We performed RNA seq coupled Hsf1-AA at 30ÂºC and following 10' heat shock at 39ÂºC.  1 ÂµM rapamycin was added for 45 minutes to anchor away Hsf1.,30605674,Cell Rep
Systems-level analyses reveal a convergent pathway for progression of diffuse astrocytoma and potential role for resveratrol in delaying high-grade transformation,GSE117620,Homo sapiens,We assembled genome-wide gene regulatory networks (âmodulesâ) that are differentially co-expressed between grade II and grade III IDH1-mutated astrocytomas in order to identify drivers of astrocytoma progression. We prioritized module M2 as a candidate module regulating glioma transformation on the basis that the module was enriched for cancer predisposition genes and had a pattern of expression in human glioma samples associated with both clinical progression and genomic aberrations in known cancer genes. M2 was functionally enriched for genes related to cell cycle regulation， and a genome-wide reverse engineering approach predicted the known cell cycle regulators FoxM1， B-Myb， and E2F2 as key transcriptional regulators of this module. Using separate drug-induced transcriptional perturbation data， we predicted that the naturally occurring polyphenol resveratrol down-regulates multiple nodes of M2. Transcriptional modulation of M2 by resveratrol and its predicted growth inhibitory effects was experimentally confirmed in vitro using low-passage primary human astrocytoma cells， including at nanomolar concentrations of resveratrol achievable in human cerebral spinal fluid from oral dosing.,Primary anaplastic astrocytoma cells (TB98) were treated with 20uM， 10nM and 2nM resveratrol for 24h,31420939,Ann Clin Transl Neurol
Effect of miR-494-3p on LPS-treated intestinal epithelial cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice,GSE137890,Mus musculus,The microenvironment of injured mucosa has important effects on intestinal stem cell self-renewal and reconstruction of epithelial barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However， the precise status of the interactions between intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) injury， particularly intestinal crypt absence， and microenvironment in IBD is not completely understood. We identified miR-494-3p as important for protection of colonic stemness in intestinal inflammation colonic organoid culture. A novel cytokine-cytokine receptor， EDA-A2/EDA2R， could suppress colonic stemness and epithelial repair during IBD. During intestinal inflammation， high level of LP macrophage-derived EDA-A2 inhibited the nuclear Î²-catenin/c-Myc axis and organoid growth by targeting EDA2R in colonic crypt stem cells. We further demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-6 are capable of stimulating macrophages to release EDA-A2 during colitis. Secondly， we identified the cross-talk among IECs， colonic crypts， and lamina propria (LP) macrophages in miR-494-3p-mediated colitis. Furthermore， our study showed that miR-494-3p deficiency in IECs promoted LP macrophage recruitment and M1 activation in DSS-induced colitis mice. In addition， we identified miR-494-3p as critical to dampening IEC injury; specifically， miR-494-3p inhibited inflammation-induced IKKÎ²/NF-ÎºB activation by targeting the IKKÎ² 3âUTR in IECs. As such， administration of adequate amounts of a miR-494-3p agomire attenuate colitis in vivo. Consistent with this inference， we showed that miR-494-3p levels were decreased in colonic crypts and serum in colitis mice， and loss of miR-494 potentiated the severity of colonic colitis. Our clinical data on the interactions between miR-494-3p levels in serum exosomes & colonic tissues and associated outcomes support the clinical relevance of miR-494-3p in IBD. The miR-494-3p agomir system， which we designed permits local delivery in vivo in this study， significantly ameliorated the severity of colonic colitis. Our findings no only uncover a miR-494-3p-mediated cross-talk mechanism by which inflamed colonic LP macrophages integrate signals from IECs to regulate colonic stemness and colonic epithelial repair/homeostasis. The miR-494-3p agomir may serve as a potential therapeutic approach in IBD.,mRNA profiles of intestinal epithelial cells from C57BL/6 mice (male， 8-week-old) which were pretreated with 1Î¼g/ml LPS for 24 hours were generated by deep sequencing， using BGISEQ-500 RS RNA-Seq.,33594251,Commun Biol
A comprehensive epigenomic analysis of phenotypically distinguishable， genetically identical female and male Daphnia pulex,GSE124427,Daphnia pulex,BackgroundDaphnia species reproduce by cyclic parthenogenesis involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. The sex of the offspring is environmentally determined and mediated via endocrine signalling by the mother. Interestingly， male and female Daphnia can be genetically identical， yet display large differences in behaviour， morphology， lifespan and metabolic activity. Our goal was to integrate multiple omics datasets， including gene expression， splicing， histone modification and DNA methylation data generated from genetically identical female and male Daphnia pulex under controlled laboratory settings with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the underlying epigenetic factors that may contribute to the phenotypic differences observed between the two genders.ResultsIn this study we demonstrate that gene expression level is positively correlated with increased DNA methylation， and histone H3 trimethylation at lysineâ4 (H3K4me3) at predicted promoter regions. Conversely， elevated histone H3 trimethylation at lysineâ27 (H3K27me3)， distributed across the entire transcript length， is negatively correlated with gene expression level. Interestingly， male Daphnia are dominated with epigenetic modifications that globally promote elevated gene expression， while female Daphnia are dominated with epigenetic modifications that reduce gene expression globally. For examples， CpG methylation (positively correlated with gene expression level) is significantly higher in almost all differentially methylated sites in male compared to female Daphnia. Furthermore， H3K4me3 modifications are higher in male compared to female Daphnia in more than 3/4 of the differentially regulated promoters. On the other hand， H3K27me3 is higher in female compared to male Daphnia in more than 5/6 of differentially modified sites. However， both sexes demonstrate roughly equal number of genes that are up-regulated in one gender compared to the other sex. Since， gene expression analyses typically assume that most genes are expressed at equal level among samples and different conditions， and thus cannot detect global changes affecting most genes.ConclusionsThe epigenetic differences between male and female in Daphnia pulex are vast and dominated by changes that promote elevated gene expression in male Daphnia. Furthermore， the differences observed in both gene expression changes and epigenetic modifications between the genders relate to pathways that are physiologically relevant to the observed phenotypic differences.,Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from the samples using MasterPure DNA puriï¬cation kit (Epicentre， USA) and RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen Ltd， UK)， respectively as described by (Athanasio et al. 2016， 2018).

Fine-mapping within eQTL Credible Intervals by E-CROPseq,GSE140553,Homo sapiens,Precise identification of causal variants within credible intervals of eQTL associations is needed to identify regulatory GWAS variants. We show that CROPseq， namely multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing combined with single cell RNAseq， is a viable strategy for fine mapping regulatory SNPs.  Mutations were induced nearby 67 SNPs in three genes， two of which， rs2251039 and rs17523802， significantly altered CISD1 and PARK7 expression， respectively， and overlap with chromatin accessibility peaks.,Single cell RNA-seq profiles of HL60/S4 infected by 67 gRNA CROP-seq lenti-viral libraries of two biological replicates.

A large pool of actively cycling progenitors orchestrates self-renewal and injury repair of an ectodermal appendage,GSE131204,Mus musculus,The classical model posits that a small number of quiescent stem cells (SCs) gives rise to proliferating transit-amplifying cells before terminal differentiation. However， recent evidence indicates that some tissues house multiple progenitor pools with distinct proliferative and differentiation potentials. Resolving the identity and spatial organization of these populations is therefore a fundamental requirement for understanding tissue renewal. Here， using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)， mouse genetics， and tissue injury approaches， we uncovered cellular hierarchies and mechanisms underlying the maintenance and repair of the ever-growing mouse incisor， an ectodermal appendage model system that requires high cell turnover for its homeostasis and quick healing capability. We found that during homeostasis， a group of actively cycling epithelial progenitors generates both the enamel-producing ameloblasts and the adjacent non-ameloblast cell layers， which were previously proposed to be quiescent SCs. Upon injury， transient adjustments to the proliferation kinetics of dental epithelial progenitor cells compensated for cell loss. Injury repair was also supported by direct conversion of supporting Notch1-expressing cells to ameloblasts. Our elucidation of epithelial SC identity， position， and function thus provides a mechanistic basis for the homeostasis and repair of a fast-turnover ectodermal appendage and illustrates how a cycling progenitor pool confers considerable epithelial plasticity during tissue renewal.,Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse incisor growth region EPCAM+ cells under two conditions: 1) homeostasis (5 mice pooled into one sample); 2) 3-days post-injury with 5- fluorouracil (5 mice pooled into one sample).,31481792,Nat Cell Biol
Systematic evaluation of C. elegans lincRNAs with CRISPR knockout mutants [lncRNA-seq],GSE115320,Caenorhabditis elegans,Background: LincRNAs play critical roles in eukaryotic cells， but systematic analyses of lincRNAs of an animal for phenotypes have been missing. We have generated CRISPR knockout strains for C. elegans lincRNAs and have evaluated their phenotypesResults: C. elegans lincRNAs demonstrate global features such as shorter length and fewer exons than mRNAs. For the systematic evaluation of C. elegans lincRNAs， CRISPR knockout strains for 155 out of all the 170 C. elegans lincRNAs were produced. Mutants of 23 lincRNAs have shown phenotypes in 6 traits analyzed. We have investigated these phenotypic lincRNAs for their gene expression patterns and their potential functional mechanisms. Some C. elegans lincRNAs play cis roles to modulate the expression of their neighboring genes， and some other lincRNAs play trans roles as ceRNAs against microRNAs. LincRNAs are extensively regulated by transcription factors， and we dissect the pathway that two transcription factors UNC-30 and UNC-55 control the expression of linc-73 together. Furthermore， linc-73 plays a cis role to modulate the expression of its neighboring gene unc-104， and thus regulates the formation of presynapses.Conclusions: By using CRISPR/cas9 technology， we have generated knockout strains of 155 C. elegans lincRNAs as valuable resources for studies in noncoding RNAs， and we provide biological insights for 23 phenotypic lincRNAs identified from 6 traits examined.,C. elegans mRNA profiles of 9 different stages (N2_embryo， N2_L1， N2_L2， N2_L3， N2_L4， N2_Young_Adult， N2_dauer， N2_starved_mixture， him-5) were generated by deep sequencing， using Illumina HiSeq 2500 and BGISEQ-500.,30621757,Genome Biol
Teosinte Pollen Drive guides maize domestication and evolution by RNA interference [small RNA-seq],GSE234924,Zea mays subsp. mays x Zea mays subsp. mexicana,Meiotic drivers subvert Mendelian expectations by manipulating reproductive development to bias their own transmission. Chromosomal drive typically functions in asymmetric female meiosis， while gene drive is normally postmeiotic and typically found in males.  Cryptic drive is thought to be pervasive and can be unleashed following hybridization with a naÃ¯ve genome， resulting in sterility and hybrid incompatibility. Using single molecule and single pollen genome sequencing， we describe an instance of gene drive in hybrids between maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and teosinte mexicana (Zea mays ssp. mexicana)， that depends on RNA interference (RNAi) in the male germline. Multiple hairpin-derived small RNA from mexicana target a novel domestication gene，  Teosinte Drive Responder，  that is required for pollen fertility and has undergone selection for immunity to RNAi.  Introgression of mexicana into early cultivated maize is thought to have been critical to its geographical dispersal throughout the Americas.  A survey of maize landraces and sympatric populations of teosinte mexicana reveals allelic bias at genes required for RNAi on at least 4 chromosomes that are also subject to gene drive in pollen from synthetic hybrids.  Teosinte Pollen Drive likely played a major role in maize domestication， and offers an explanation for the widespread abundance of hairpin-encoded and other endogenous small RNA  in the germlines of plants and animals.,Small RNA sequencing of Tpd1/tpd1;Tpd2/tpd2 and tpd1;tpd2 pollen and leaf， and dcl2T-/- and dcl2-mu1-/- pollen,39112710,Nature

SLFN11 blocks stressed replication forks independently of ATR,GSE101512,Homo sapiens,SLFN11 sensitizes cancer cells to a broad range of DNA-targeted therapies. Here we show that， in response to replication stress induced by camptothecin， SLFN11 tightly binds chromatin at stressed replication foci via RPA1 together with the replication helicase subunit MCM3. Unlike ATR， SLFN11 neither interferes with the loading of CDC45 and PCNA nor inhibits the initiation of DNA replication but selectively blocks fork progression while inducing chromatin opening across replication initiation sites. The ATPase domain of SLFN11 is required for chromatin opening， replication block and cell death but not for the tight binding of SLFN11 to chromatin. Replication stress by the CHK1 inhibitor Prexasertib also recruits SLFN11 to nascent replicating DNA together with CDC45 and PCNA. We conclude that SLFN11 is recruited to stressed replication forks carrying extended RPA filaments where it blocks replication by changing chromatin structure across replication sites.,Genome-wide mapping of chromatin accessibility was done by following the published method (Buenrostro et al.， 2013). Briefly， fifty thousand CCRF-CEM parental and SLFN11-del cells were treated with DMSO or CPT (100 nM) for 2 and 4 hours. K562-Vector， -WT and âE669Q cells were treated with DMSO or CPT (1 Î¼M) for 4 hours. To prepare nuclei， cells were lysed using cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl， pH 7.4， 10 mM NaCl， 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). Immediately following the nuclei preparation， the pellet was re-suspended in the transposase reaction mix [25 Î¼l 2x TD buffer， 2.5 Î¼l Transposase (Illumina) and 22.5 Î¼l of nuclease free water]， and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 Â°C. Directly following transposition， the sample was purified using a DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 (ZYMO RESEARCH) and eluted with 25 Î¼l of DNA elution buffer. Following purification， we amplified library fragments using 1x NEBnext PCR master mix and 1.25 Î¼M of custom Nextera PCR primers 1 and 2， using the following PCR conditions: 72Â°C for 5 minutes， 98Â°C for 30 seconds， followed by thermo-cycling at 98Â°C for 10 seconds， 63Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 1 minute. We amplified the full libraries for 5 cycles， after 5 cycles we took an aliquot of the PCR reaction and added 10 Î¼l of the PCR cocktail with Syber Green at a final concentration of 0.6x. We ran this reaction for 20 cycles， to determine the additional number of cycles needed for the remaining 45 Î¼L reaction. Libraries were amplified for a total of 10â12 cycles and purified using a PCRClean DX yielding a final library concentration of ~30 nM in 20 Î¼l.,29395061,Mol Cell

Human lineage tracing enabled by mitochondrial mutations and single cell genomics [TF1_clones_ATAC],GSE115208,Homo sapiens,Lineage tracing provides unprecedented insights into the fate of individual cells and their progeny in complex organisms. While effective genetic approaches have been developed in vitro and in animal models， these cannot be used to interrogate human physiology in vivo. Instead， naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues， but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale， and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. Here， we show how somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be tracked by current single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) or single cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) for simultaneous analysis of single cell lineage and state. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their use as clonal markers to infer lineal relationships. We trace the lineage of human cells by somatic mtDNA mutations in a native context both in vitro and in vivo， and relate it to expression profiles and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow lineage tracing at a 100- to 1，000-fold greater scale than with single cell whole genome sequencing， while providing information on cell state， opening the way to chart detailed cell lineage and fate maps in human health and disease.A variety of experimental designs using cells derived from both in vitro and in vivo to determine the efficacy of using mtDNA mutations in human clonal tracing.,TF1 (sub-)clones were clonally derived by single cell sorting in an iterative manner and expanded before processing each clone with bulk ATAC-seq.

Transcription-induced formation of extrachromosomal DNA during yeast ageing,GSE135542,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) facilitates adaptive evolution by allowing rapid and extensive gene copy number variation， and is implicated in the pathology of cancer and ageing. Here， we demonstrate that yeast aged under environmental copper accumulate high levels of eccDNA containing the copper resistance gene CUP1. Transcription of CUP1 causes CUP1 eccDNA accumulation， which occurs in the absence of phenotypic selection. We have developed a sensitive and quantitative eccDNA sequencing pipeline that reveals CUP1 eccDNA accumulation on copper exposure to be exquisitely site specific， with no other detectable changes across the eccDNA complement. eccDNA forms de novo from the CUP1 locus through processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by Sae2 / Mre11 and Mus81， and genome-wide analyses show that other protein coding eccDNA species in aged yeast share a similar biogenesis pathway. Although abundant we find that CUP1 eccDNA does not replicate efficiently， and high copy numbers in aged cells arise through frequent formation events combined with asymmetric DNA segregation. The transcriptional stimulation of CUP1 eccDNA formation shows that age-linked genetic change varies with transcription pattern， resulting in gene copy number profiles tailored by environment.,Aged cell samples analysed in pairs of -/+ Cu， for both wt and various mutants. 3 replicates of the 3xCUP1 experiment are included,31794573,PLoS Biol

VGLL1 cooperates with TEAD4 to control human trophectoderm lineage specification [scRNA-Seq],GSE252377,Homo sapiens,In contrast to rodents， the mechanisms underlying human trophectoderm and early placenta specification are understudied due to ethical barriers and the scarcity of embryos. Recent reports have shown that human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can differentiate into trophectoderm (TE)-like cells (TELCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs)， offering a valuable in vitro model to study early placenta specification. Here， we demonstrate that the VGLL1 (vestigial-likefamilymember1)， which is highly expressed during human and non-human primate TE specification in vivo but is negligibly expressed in mouse， is a critical regulator of cell fate determination and self-renewal in human TELCs and TSCs derived from naÃ¯ve PSCs. Mechanistically， VGLL1 partners with the transcription factor TEAD4 (TEA domain transcription factor 4) to regulate chromatin accessibility at target gene loci through histone acetylation and acts in cooperation with GATA3 and TFAP2C. Our work is relevant to understand primate early embryogenesis and how it differs from other mammalian species.,Human naÃ¯ve PSCs were dissociated into single cells with a 1:1 mixture of 0.5 mM EDTA and TrypLE Express and plated at a density of 100，000 cell/well of 6-well plate on Geltrex in TE induction medium (1:1 mix of Neurobasal medium (Gibco) and DMEM/F12 (HyClone) supplemented with N2 (Gibco) and B27 (Gibco)， penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone)， Glutamax (Gibco)， Î²-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)， 1 ÂµM PD0325901 (Axon) and 1 ÂµM A83-01 (Selleck)) for five days.

Proliferation-competent Tcf1+ CD8 T-cells in dysfunctional populations are CD4 T-cell help independent,GSE137007,Mus musculus,Effector CD8 T-cell responses in chronic infection and cancer are maintained by proliferation competent progenitors， which share features with the progenitors of memory T-cells in acutely resolved infections. Combining classical assessment of population dynamics with single cell RNA-sequencing， we discovered a switch in the need for CD4 help between related populations in acute and chronic infection. While in acute infection memory T-cells but not effector T-cells are CD4 help dependent， we found the opposite in chronic infection. Thus， progenitor cells in chronic infection acquire a level of autonomous function that is not seen among their counterparts in acute infection. Vice versa， the dependece of the effector cells highlight why a functional antigen-specific CD4 T-cell compartment is critical in therapeutic settings.,Single cell splenocyte suspensions were obtained by mashing total spleens through a 100 Î¼m nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon) and red blood cells were lysed with a hypotonic ACK buffer. Transgenic CD8+ T-cells were isolated using the mouse CD8+ T-cell enrichment kit (Miltenyi Biotech， Bergisch-Gladbach， Germany). 2x10e3 CD45.1+ P14 TCRÎ±Î² were transferred into naÃ¯ve CD45.2+ C57BL/6 mice. 5x10e6 pfu wild-type LCMV c13 was diluted in PBS and injected intravenously. In vivo depletion of CD4 lymphocytes was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 300 Âµg anti-mouse CD4 antibody (clone GK1.5; Bio X Cell， USA) diluted in PBS and injected on day -2， +1， and thereafter on each fifth day after infection. At day 40 post infection， splenocytes were enriched for CD45.1 + P14 T-cells using anti-CD45.1 biotin/ anti-biotin conjugated microbeads and magnetic MACS cell separation (Miltenyi Biotech， Bergisch-Gladbach， Germany). Single-cells were sorted on BD FACS Fusion (100 micron nozzle， standard operation settings， single-cell purity， index sorting). Individual cells meeting the gating strategy were sorted directly in lysis buffer into individual wells of a low-binding PCR plate. Immediately after sorting， each plate was spun down， snap-freezed on dry ice and stored at -80oC until use. The single-cell libraries were generated using the previously described SCRB-seq protocol (doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/003236)， with some modifications.  After RNA purification and reverse transcription， the generated single-cell cDNA was amplified for 22 cycles. The barcoded single-cell amplicons were purified with the use of (0.6x) Agencourt AMPure XP beads. 1 ng of the resulting amplified cDNA were used for library preparation with the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Library reagents (FC-131-1024， Illumina). After PCR amplification of the fragmented libraries， the samples were purified with (0.6x) Agencourt AMPure XP beads and eluted in 10 Âµl of molecular grade water. The quality of the resulting library was assessed with the use of Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (5067-4626， Agilent). The library quantification was performed based on the Illumina recommendations (SY-930-1010， Illumina) with the use of KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (KK4600， Kapa Biosystems). The samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 system at the following conditions â high output run mode， paired-end， 16 bp read 1， 49 bp read 2， single-indexed sequencing resulting in 1 million reads per single-cell. A total of 1728 single-cells were sequenced â 864 ctrl and 864 w/o CD4 single-cells.

Characterization of novel primary miRNA transcription units in human cells using Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing,GSE132392,Homo sapiens,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key contributors to gene regulatory networks. Because miRNAs are processed from RNA polymerase II transcripts， insight into miRNA regulation requires a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of primary miRNA transcripts. We used Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing and hidden Markov model segmentation to map primary miRNA transcription units (TUs) across 32 human cell lines， allowing us to describe TUs encompassing 1462 miRNAs from miRBase and 465 from MirGeneDB. We identified 54 TUs not previously described for MirGeneDB miRNAs. Many primary transcripts containing miRNA sequences failed to generate mature miRNAs， suggesting that miRNA biosynthesis is under both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. In addition to constitutive and cell-type specific TU expression regulated by differential promoter usage， miRNA synthesis can be regulated by transcription past polyadenylation sites (transcriptional read through) and promoter divergent transcription (PROMPTs). We identified 203 miRNA TUs with novel promoters， 99 with transcriptional read-throughs and 3 miRNA TUs that resemble PROMPTs in at least one cell line. The miRNA TU annotation data resource described here reveals a greater complexity in miRNA regulation than previously known and provides a framework for identifying cell-type specific differences in miRNA transcription in cancer and following exposure to environmental insults or therapeutics.,Nascent RNA Bru-seq used to map primary miRNA transcripts across 32 diverse human cell lines， allowing for systematic assessment of the various transcription units encompassing known miRNAs,31709421,NAR Genom Bioinform

We propose a model whereby RNA demethylases ensure normal RNA metabolism by suppressing disruptive RNA methylation in the nucleus.,UV crosslinking， immunoprecipitation and exonuclease treatment with anti-m6A antibodies was used to map m6A/m6Am in transcriptome-wide at single-base-resolution.,32813009,Nucleic Acids Res

Analysis of gene expression profiles from the liver of rats treated with the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III inhibitor GSK932121A (50mg/kg) or vehicle control,GSE65374,Rattus norvegicus,BACKGROUND: Correlating in vitro mitochondrial data to outcomes in vivo remains a challenge and improving methods to assess mitochondrial function in vivo would both guide safer candidate selection and support the growing number of discovery programmes targeting mitochondria for pharmacological intervention. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to assess the toxicity profile of a compound with complex III electron transport chain inhibitory activity (GSK932121A) in order to identify markers and mechanisms of mitochondrial perturbation in vivo. METHODS:Crl:CD(SD) rats were dosed IP with GSK932121A for up to 5 hours depending upon the severity of observed clinical signs. Respirometry， microscopy， lactate/pyruvate and transcriptomics profiling were used to aid identification of a mode of action and this data was compared with functional data in isolated mitochondria. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: GSK932121A administered in vivo caused hypothermia and a metabolic shift in energy production provoking an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio， microvesicular steatosis and glycogen depletion; alongside gene expression changes indicative of a fasted state. Our data improves current understanding of the toxicological consequences of drug induced respiratory chain inhibition and guides endpoint selection for future investigative safety studies with mitochondrially active molecules.,50mg/kg GSK932121A treated rat livers (n=10) were used to assess differential gene expression when compared with 0mg.kg GSK932121A Vehicle Control (n=12). Two samples were excluded from the 50mg/kg group due to low plasma exposure to GSK932121A,29780577,Toxicol Res (Camb)

A TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis modulates PRC2 functions in controlling stem cell bivalency [ChIP-seq],GSE182442,Mus musculus,The mammalian Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins regulate the epigenome through catalytic activity (CA)-dependent and -independent functions. While catalytic activity of TETs has been intensely studied as DNA demethylation enzymes， little is known about their CA-independent function in early embryo development. Here we defined the CA-independent function of TET1 in naÃ¯ve-to-formative pluripotent states transition. Using a proteomics method， we mapped the TET1 interactome and identified Paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) as a partner of TET1 for transcriptional repression at the bivalent genes in early development. Genome-wide location analysis revealed that PSPC1-bound regions largely overlap with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits. Functional studies with genetic methods indicated that PSPC1 and TET1 repress， while lncRNA Neat1 activates the bivalent genes during their transcriptional activation. In embryonic stem cell (ESC) state， Neat1 tethers TET1， PSPC1， and PRC2 at promoters. During the ESCs to formative Epiblast like stem cells (EpiLCs) differentiation， PSPC1 and TET1 repress the PRC2 affinity to nascent mRNA transcripts of bivalent genes， while Neat1 facilitates PRC2 binding to those transcripts. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which proteins TET1 and PSPC1， and lncRNA Neat1 dynamically regulate gene transcription by modulating the PRC2 activity in pluripotent states transition.,ChIP-seq analysis of PSPC1 and SUZ12 in ESCs and EpiLCs,35675764,Cell Rep

Pre-clinical models for prediction of immunotherapy outcomes and immune evasion mechanisms in genetically heterogeneous multiple myeloma,GSE220997,Mus musculus,Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasia of bone marrow (BM) plasma cells that remains largely incurable with current treatment. Advancing therapeutic discoveries has been hampered by the lack of genetically heterogeneous models of MM. To circumvent this limitation， we engineered fifteen mouse models carrying combinations of eight MM genetic drivers， which fulfilled the pathogenesis of human disease including progression from premalignant states under immune surveillance. Integrative analyses of â500 mice and â1，000 patients revealed a MAPK-MYC genetic pathway that regulates time to progression and immune escape mechanisms across genetically heterogeneous tumors. During progression， MYC-dependent and independent remodeling of the BM microenvironment divided MM into immune categories with predominance of selected T-cell subpopulations， which dictated immunotherapy responses. Experimental targeting of the cytotoxic or immunosuppressive T-cell states observed in refractory MM patients enhanced immunotherapy effectiveness. Our resource enabled characterization of MM cell-intrinsic and immunological traits at unprecedented levels， which will accelerate the translation of personalized immunotherapy.,scRNA-seq + scTCR-seq were performed in 13 bone marrow aspirates from 2 healthy (YcÉ£1)， 3 MGUS (BIcÉ£1)， 3 MM (BIcÉ£1)， 3 MGUS (MIC) and 2 MM (MIC) bearing mice. Cells were FACS sorted (a mix of 0.8x10^5 T cells + 0.8x10^5 NK cells + 0.25x10^5 monocytes + 0.15x10^5 B cells) in 100 ÂµL of PBS+0.05% BSA. Samples with at least 90% viability were processed using the 10X Genomics (CA， USA) scRNA/TCRseq kit， following the manufacturerâs instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J v1.1 protocol rev F for human samples and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5â v2 Dual Index protocol rev B for mice samples). Quality control was performed with Qubit Fluorometric Quantification (ThermoFisher Scientific， MA， USA) using the double-stranded DNA high-sensitivity assay kit， and with TapeStation (Agilent， Santa Clara， CA) using high-sensitivity screentapes. Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 550 (Illumina， San Diego， CA).WES was performed in 71 BM samples isolated from GFP+ CD138+B220â PCs (purity， >99%)， including 62 samples from the MM stage， 3 samples of pooled PCs from nine mice at the MGUS stage (3 mice with similar genotype were included on each pooled sample)， and 6 samples from MM-derived cell lines.

RNA-seq - Combining developmental and perturbation-seq uncovers transcriptional modules orchestrating neuronal remodeling,GSE101946,Drosophila melanogaster,Developmental neuronal remodeling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism required for accurate wiring of mature nervous systems.Despite its fundamental role in neurodevelopment and proposed contribution to various neuropsychiatric disorders， the mechanisms instructing remodeling are only partially known.Here， we uncover the fine temporal transcriptional landscape of a stereotypic remodeling event - that of the Drosophila mushroom body Î³ neurons.To enrich and complement this developmental expression atlas， we also sequenced developing Î³ neurons perturbed for three key transcription factors known to regulate pruning.Together， these datasets allowed us to construct the developmental and temporal framework of transcriptional modules that together drive remodeling.Moreover， we identified 10 DNA binding proteins that are involved in various aspects of remodeling， and describe their hierarchical relationships.Overall， this study provides the first broad and detailed molecular insight into the complex regulatory dynamics of developmental neuronal remodeling.,Transcriptional profiling of drosophila Î³ neurons during development and when perturbed by EcR-DN， E75 RNAi or Sox14 RNAi.

Hepatocyte mARC1 Promotes Fatty Liver Disease,GSE223652,Homo sapiens,Background and AimsNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a prevalence of ~25% worldwide， with significant public health consequences yet has few effective treatments. Human genetics can help elucidate novel biology and identify targets of new therapeutics. Genetic variants in mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1 (MTARC1) have been associated with NAFLD and liver-related mortality， however， its pathophysiological role and the cell type(s) mediating these effects remain unclear. We aimed to investigate how MTARC1 exerts its effects on NAFLD by integrating human genetics with in vitro and in vivo studies of mARC1 knockdown.MethodsAnalyses including multi-trait colocalization and Mendelian randomization were used to assess the genetic associations of MTARC1. In addition， we established an in vitro long-term primary human hepatocyte model with metabolic readouts and used the Gubra GAN diet NASH mouse model treated with hepatocyte specific GalNAc-siRNA to understand the in vivo impacts of MTARC1.ResultsWe show that genetic variants within the MTARC1 locus are associated with liver enzymes， liver fat， plasma lipids and body composition and these associations are due to the same causal variant (p.A165T， rs2642438 G>A)， suggesting a shared mechanism. We demonstrated that increased MTARC1 mRNA had an adverse effect on these traits using Mendelian Randomization， implying therapeutic inhibition of mARC1 could be beneficial. In vitro mARC1 knockdown decreased lipid accumulation and increased triglyceride secretion and in vivo GalNAc-siRNA mediated knockdown of mARC1 lowered hepatic， but increased plasma triglycerides. We found alterations in pathways regulating lipid metabolism and decreased secretion of 3-hydroxybutyrate upon mARC1 knockdown in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionsCollectively， our findings from human genetics， and in vitro and in vivo hepatocyte-specific mARC1 knockdown support the potential efficacy of hepatocyte-specific targeting of mARC1 for treatment of NAFLD.,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for cultured primary human hepatocytes treated with MTARC1 siRNA under different media conditions.,nan,
Developmental programming of Kupffer cells by maternal obesity causes fatty liver disease in the offspring II,GSE237405,Mus musculus,Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages which colonize the developing liver early during embryogenesis1. Throughout development and adulthood， KCs have distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis， such as supporting fetal erythropoiesis as well as postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism2. KCs acquire their tissue-specific transcriptional signature immediately after colonizing the liver， mature together with the tissue， and adapt to the tissueâs function1，3，4. However， whether perturbation of macrophage core functions during development may contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here， we utilize a maternal obesity model to disturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring born to obese mothers develop fatty liver disease that is accompanied by a local pro-inflammatory response， a phenotype that is augmented if the offspring is kept on control diet after birth. Further， transcriptional analyses reveal that KCs undergo developmental programming through the maternal high-fat diet， which lasts until adulthood. The offspringâs KC developmental programming is irreversible despite the switch to control diet and leads to increased lipid uptake in hepatocytes mediated via paracrine factors stemming from KCs. The transcriptional programming of KCs and the fatty liver disease phenotype are rescued by genetic depletion of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (Hif1a) in macrophages during gestation. These results demonstrate that macrophages rely on an undisturbed development to fulfil their core functions and support organ homeostasis during adulthood， and establish developmental programming of KCs as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders， such as fatty liver disease.,Three-week-old female mice were initially fed with a control diet (CD) for two weeks and were thereafter divided into two groups: one continued on the CD while the other received a high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks. The homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess metabolic changes. Mice with higher HOMA-IR on the HFD were selected to create a maternal obesity model and mice fed with CD were used to generated maternal lean offspring. All females were mated with CD males. Offspring born to maternal obese were cross-fostered to generate both lactating groups and offspring born to maternal lean mothers were crossed-fostered by other maternal lean mothers. Male offspring were weaned into CD or HFD postweaning cages. Livers of offspring were harvested at 11-12 weeks of age and subsequently dissociated into single-cell suspension. Kupffer cells were then sorted using flurescence-activated cell sorting on an BD FACSAria lII cell sorter directly into 500Î¼l QIAzol lysis buffer (Qiagen) and proceeded for sequencing using SMART-Seq2 protocol.,38778016,Sci Data
spinDrop: a modular droplet microfluidic platform to maximise single-cell RNA sequencing information content,GSE208156,Homo sapiens;Mus musculus,Droplet microfluidic methods have massively increased the throughput of single-cell RNA sequencing campaigns. The benefit of scale-up is， however， accompanied by increased background noise when processing challenging samples as well as lower overall RNA capture efficiency. These drawbacks stem from the lack of strategies to enrich for high-quality material at the moment of cell encapsulation and the lack of implementable multi-step enzymatic processes that increase RNA capture. Here we alleviate both bottlenecks by deploying fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells， intact nuclei or fixed cells and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold， while reducing background noise by up to half， depending on sample quality. We harness these unique properties to deliver a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development using highly damaged input material. Our method is broadly applicable to other droplet-based workflows to deliver sensitive and accurate single-cell profiling at a reduced cost.,Mouse ES， HEK293T cells and mouse embryonic brain sections at stage E10.5 were dissociated and processed for single-cell RNA-sequencing using the spinDrop workflow.,37553326,Nat Commun

ZNF643/ZFP69B exerts oncogenic properties and associates with cell adhesion and immune processes [RNA-seq],GSE242002,Homo sapiens,The global cancer burden remains high; thus， it is crucial to entangle molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis to improve current prevention and treatment options. We previously detected the ZNF643/ZFP69B gene upregulated in multiple tumors， and we speculated it may play a role in tumor biology. To test this hypothesis， we employed TCGA-centered databases to correlate ZNF643 status with various clinicopathological parameters. We also performed RNA-seq analysis， in vitro studies assessing cancer cell phenotype， and searched for ZNF643-bound genomic loci. Our data indicated higher levels of ZNF643 in most analyzed tumors compared to normal samples， possibly due to copy number variations. ZNF643 mRNA correlated with diverse molecular and immune subtypes and clinicopathological features (tumor stage， grade， patient survival). RNA-seq analysis revealed that ZNF643 silencing triggers the deregulation of the genes implicated in various cancer-related processes， such as growth， adhesion， and the immune system. Moreover， we observed that ZNF643 positively influences cell proliferation， cell cycle， migration， and invasion in a cell type-dependent manner. Finally， our ChIP-seq analysis indicated that the genes associated with ZNF643 binding are linked to adhesion and immune signaling. In conclusion， our data confirm the oncogenic properties of ZNF643 and pinpoint its impact on cell adhesion and immune processes.,We analyzed 6 samples from two different lung cancer cell lines in biological triplicates (total 18 samples). For each cell line (H2073 and SKMES) we analyzed unmodified cells (WT)， cells with knocked-down expression of ZNF643 (shZNF643) and cells carrying control shRNA sequence (shLUC). Pair-end RNA sequencing was performed for all samples on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina). DEG (Differentially Expressed Genes) analysis was performed on two different comparison pairs (sh643 vs. two control samples WT and shLUC separately) using edgeR.,38003570,Int J Mol Sci
Effect of Replicative Aging on Cryptococcus neoformans,GSE260902,Cryptococcus neoformans,Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is an opportunistic fungal microorganism that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis. During the infection， the microbial population is heterogeneously composed of cells with varying generational ages， with older cells accumulating during chronic infections. This is attributed to their enhanced resistance to phagocytic killing and tolerance of antifungals like fluconazole (FLC). Using RNA-seq， we investigated how transcriptomic changes in different aspects of metabolism contribute to age-associated FLC tolerance in Cn.,To study the effects of replicative aging on the transcriptome of C. neoformans， we isolated young (0-3 generations) and old (10 generations) cells. Then， the transcriptomes of young and old cells were analyzed to identify ent gene expression.,39136442,mBio

However， some patients develop resistance to immunotherapy or do not respond. Recent literature has demonstrated that epigenetic regulation governs the transition from effector to exhausted T cells. Here， we describe a novel antigen-specific assay for T-cell exhaustion that produces T cells biologically and epigenetically similar to their in vivo exhausted counterpart. We perform a CRISPR KO screen for epigenetic regulators of the human genome and validate Ikaros as a driver of T-cell exhaustion. We determined that the Ikaros degrader iberdomide prevents exhaustion by blocking chromatin remodeling at T cell effector enhancers by preserving activity of key transcription factors AP-1， NF-ÎºB and NFAT using transcription factor footprinting analysis. Thus， our study uncovers a role for Ikaros， degraded by the drug iberdomide， as a driver of T-cell exhaustion.,SHARE-seq to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in T cells from four healthy human donors. Donor PBMCs were expanded for antigen-specific T cells using viral peptide cocktail over the course of 7 or 14 days. Iberdomide or DMSO was used to treat cells from day 7 -14.,nan,
Disruption of the IL-33-ST2-AKT signaling axis impairs neurodevelopment by inhibiting microglial metabolic adaptation and phagocytic function,GSE127449,Mus musculus,Using single-cell RNA-Seq coupled with pharmacological and genetic perturbation to indentify a range of microglial states and uncover novel pathways that regulate microglial function and activation during postnatal development.,1， To define the transcriptional landscape of developing microglia in postnatal cortex， we profiled 9，391 CD45int CD11bint cells from postnatal (postnatal day 9， P9) and young adult (postnatal day 28， P28) cortices by massively parallel droplet-based 3â scRNA-seq. 2. To explore the role of IL33-ST2 signaling in regulating the microglial activation gene program and the microglia heterogeneity， we performed scRNA-seq of cortical microglia from ST2â/â mice and littermate controls at P9. 3， To analyze the molecular signature induced by IL-33 in primary microglia， we profiled low-input bulk RNA Sequencing of primary mouse microglia stimulated with IL-33 and unstimulated control cells. 4， To analyze transcriptional features of pro-phagocytic microglia from developing brain， Tau-GFP positive and negative microglia were sorted from postnatal day 9 cortex for low-input bulk RNA Seq by SmartSeq2. 5， To analyze transcriptional signature of metabolically active microglia in developing brain， TMRM staining high and low microglia subsets were sorted from postnatal day 9 cortex for low-input bulk RNA Seq by SmartSeq2,nan,
Set6: ERCC bulk short-read RNA-seq by Element Biosciences AVITI platform， additional samples,GSE269800,synthetic construct,DNA sequencing is a critical tool in modern biology. Over the last two decades， it has been revolutionized by the advent of massively parallel sequencing， leading to significant advances in genome and transcriptome sequencing of various organisms. Nevertheless， challenges such as accuracy， lack of competitive options and prohibitive costs associated with high throughput parallel short-read sequencing persist. Here， we conduct a comparative analysis between the Element Biosciences AVITI platform and its counterpart the Illumina NextSeq platform， testing DNA and RNA short-read sequencing， as well as synthetic long-read sequencing for single cells and RNA transcripts.,Bulk short-read RNA-seq on Universal Human Reference with ERCC spike-in samples (Mix 1) by Element Biosciences AVITI platform， with four repeats,39127634,BMC Genomics
A CRISPRi/a platform in iPSC-derived microglia uncovers regulators of disease states,GSE178317,Homo sapiens,Microglia are emerging as key drivers of neurological diseases. However， we lack a systematic understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here， we present a screening platform that enables the systematic elucidation of functional consequences of genetic alterations in human iPSC-derived microglia. We developed a protocol based on the inducible expression of six transcription factors， which generates microglia-like cells in an efficient eight-day protocol which was confirmed by bulk RNA sequencing. We established inducible CRISPR interference and activation in this system and conducted three screens targeting the âdruggable genomeâ that uncovered genes controlling microglia survival， activation and phagocytosis， including neurodegeneration-associated genes. A screen with single-cell RNA sequencing readout revealed that these microglia adopt a spectrum of states mirroring those observed in human brains and identifies regulators of these states. A disease-associated state characterized by SPP1 expression is selectively depleted by CSF1R inhibition.Thus， our platform can systematically uncover regulators of microglia states， enabling their functional characterization and therapeutic targeting.,QuantSeq bulk RNA-sequencing of iTF-Microglia (Day 0， Day 8 (non-targeting and PFN1 CRISPRa sgRNAs)， Day 9 +/- LPS treatment， Day 15) and Brownjohn-iMicroglia (Brownjohn et al.， 2018， Day 9 +/- LPS treatment); Paired-end RNA-sequencing of iTF-Microglia (D14 +/- LPS treatment); and CROP-seq， single cell RNA-sequencing of Day 8 iTF-Microglia infected with a library of sgRNAs targeting 38 genes performed on four lanes of the 10X platform.,35953545,Nat Neurosci

Antibody from Single Human VH-rearranging Mouse Potently Neutralizes All SARS-CoV-2 Variants Through BA.5 by Inhibiting Membrane Fusion,GSE197255,Mus musculus,Here， we describe a mouse model in which the primary B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire is generated solely through V(D)J recombination of a human VH1-2 heavy chain (HC) and， substantially， a human Vk1-33 light chain (LC).  Thus， primary humanized BCR repertoire diversity in these mice derives from immensely diverse HC and LC antigen-contact complementarity-region-3 (CDR3) sequences generated de novo by non-templated junctional modifications during V(D)J recombination. We assayed the V usage and CDR3 diversity in this mouse model by HTGTS-repertoire sequencing.  Immunizing this human VH1-2/Vk1-33-rearranging model with prototype SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunogens elicited several VH1-2/Vk1-33-based nAbs.  Of these， SP1-77 potently and broadly neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants through BA.5.  Cryo-EM studies revealed that SP1-77 binds RBD away from the ACE2 receptor-binding-motif via a striking CDR3-dominated mode of recognition.  Lattice-light-sheet-microscopy-based studies confirmed that SP1-77 did not block ACE2-mediated viral attachment or subsequent endocytosis， but rather blocked membrane fusion.  The SP1-77 binding epitope and neutralization mechanism may offer additional strategies for designing vaccines that robustly neutralize emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.,High-thoughput sequencing of splenic B cell receptor repertoire,35951767,Sci Immunol

Epigenetic dosage identifies two major and functionally distinct Î² cell subtypes [RNA-seq],GSE224059,Mus musculus,The mechanisms that specify and stabilize cell subtypes remain poorly understood. Here， we identify two major subtypes of pancreatic Î² cells based on histone mark heterogeneity (Î²HI and Î²LO). Î²HI cells exhibit â¼4-fold higher levels of H3K27me3， distinct chromatin organization and compaction， and a specific transcriptional pattern. Î²HI and Î²LO cells also differ in size， morphology， cytosolic and nuclear ultrastructure， epigenomes， cell surface marker expression， and function， and can be FACS separated into CD24+ and CD24â fractions. Functionally， Î²HI cells have increased mitochondrial mass， activity， and insulin secretion in vivo and ex vivo. Partial loss of function indicates that H3K27me3 dosage regulates Î²HI/Î²LO ratio in vivo， suggesting that control of Î² cell subtype identity and ratio is at least partially uncoupled. Both subtypes are conserved in humans， with Î²HI cells enriched in humans with type 2 diabetes. Thus， epigenetic dosage is a novel regulator of cell subtype specification and identifies two functionally distinct Î² cell subtypes.,Bulk RNA-seq of FACS sorted Î²-cell,36948185,Cell Metab
