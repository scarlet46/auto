A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 Platform and the First 1，000，000 Profiles.,Cell, 2017 Nov 30,29195078,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195078/,We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap)， whereby genes， drugs， and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here， we report more than a 1，000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium， made possible by a new， low-cost， high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible， comparable to RNA sequencing， and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules， functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes， and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here， as well as tools for their analysis， are available at https://clue.io.Keywords:Functional genomics; chemical biology; gene expression profiling.
Comprehensive molecular characterization of pediatric radiation-induced high-grade glioma.,Nat Commun, 2021 Sep 20,34545084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34545084/,Radiation-induced high-grade gliomas (RIGs) are an incurable late complication of cranial radiation therapy. We performed DNA methylation profiling， RNA-seq， and DNA sequencing on 32 RIG tumors and an in vitro drug screen in two RIG cell lines. We report that based on DNA methylation， RIGs cluster primarily with the pediatric receptor tyrosine kinase I high-grade glioma subtype. Common copy-number alterations include Chromosome (Ch.) 1p loss/1q gain， and Ch. 13q and Ch. 14q loss; focal alterations include PDGFRA and CDK4 gain and CDKN2A and BCOR loss. Transcriptomically， RIGs comprise a stem-like subgroup with lesser mutation burden and Ch. 1p loss and a pro-inflammatory subgroup with greater mutation burden and depleted DNA repair gene expression. Chromothripsis in several RIG samples is associated with extrachromosomal circular DNA-mediated amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4. Drug screening suggests microtubule inhibitors/stabilizers， DNA-damaging agents， MEK inhibition， and， in the inflammatory subgroup， proteasome inhibitors， as potentially effective therapies.
Identification of potential synthetic lethal genes to p53 using a computational biology approach.,BMC Med Genomics, 2013 Sep 11,24025726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24025726/,Background:Identification of genes that are synthetic lethal to p53 is an important strategy for anticancer therapy as p53 mutations have been reported to occur in more than half of all human cancer cases. Although genome-wide RNAi screening is an effective approach to finding synthetic lethal genes， it is costly and labor-intensive.Methods:To illustrate this approach， we identified potentially druggable genes synthetically lethal for p53 using three microarray datasets for gene expression profiles of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines， one next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project， and one gene expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. We selected the genes which encoded kinases and had significantly higher expression in the tumors with functional p53 mutations (somatic mutations) than in the tumors without functional p53 mutations as the candidates of druggable synthetic lethal genes for p53. We identified important regulatory networks and functional categories pertinent to these genes， and performed an extensive survey of literature to find experimental evidence that support the synthetic lethality relationships between the genes identified and p53. We also examined the drug sensitivity difference between NCI-60 cell lines with functional p53 mutations and NCI-60 cell lines without functional p53 mutations for the compounds that target the kinases encoded by the genes identified.Results:Our results indicated that some of the candidate genes we identified had been experimentally verified to be synthetic lethal for p53 and promising targets for anticancer therapy while some other genes were putative targets for development of cancer therapeutic agents.Conclusions:Our study indicated that pre-screening of potential synthetic lethal genes using gene expression profiles is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of synthetic lethal RNAi screening.
Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis identifies cholesterol transport pathway as a therapeutic target of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus.,Virus Res, 2024 Dec,39580000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39580000/,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious virus that poses a serious threat to the global pig industry. Despite extensive efforts， the mechanism underlying virus entry for PEDV remains elusive. In this study， we first identified PEDV-susceptible and non-susceptible cell lines by using PEDV spike pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus. Subsequently， we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis on these cell lines. Through integrating differential expression gene analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis， we identified the key pathways that are correlated with the PEDV entry. Our analysis revealed a strong correlation between cholesterol， sterols， and lipid transport with PEDV entry， suggesting a potential role for cholesterol transport in the PEDV entry. For further investigation， we treated Huh7， Vero and LLC-PK1 cells with a cholesterol transport inhibitor， ezetimibe， and observed a significant inhibition of PEDV entry and subsequent viral replication in these cells. Interestingly， pre-treating Huh7 cells with ezetimibe resulted in an increase in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pseudoviruses. Moreover， we found that cholesterol could facilitate the entry of PEDV into Huh7 and Vero cells， and this promoting effect can be blocked by ezetimibe. These findings suggest that targeting cholesterol transport specifically inhibits PEDV entry into susceptible cells. Our study offers novel insights into the mechanism of PEDV entry and the development of new therapeutic strategies against this economically important virus.Keywords:Cholesterol transport; Coronavirus; Ezetimibe; PEDV; Viral entry.
Transcriptomic evidence of black soybean ethanolic extract and 2-aminobutyric acid in suppressing neuroinflammation and enhancing synaptic transmission.,Biomed Pharmacother, 2024 Dec,39488055,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39488055/,Introduction:Recently， the awareness of the beneficial utilization of natural bioactive compounds in treating neuroinflammation has gained particular attention. We aimed to understand the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of black soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr) ethanolic extract (BBEE) and its bioactive compound， 2-aminobutyric acid (2-AB)， against LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells.Method:Cell viability and the optimum therapeutic dose were confirmed by MTT assay. We conducted a whole-transcriptomic analysis of BBEE and 2-AB in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells using microarray normalized with SST-RMA. DEGs were selected based on p-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2， and validated by RT-qPCR and immunocytochemical analyses.Results:We found that both BBEE and 2-AB down-regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFA under LPS-induced conditions. This was also observed in the microarray data， showing downregulation of several inflammatory pathways， such as NF-kB， and IL6-JAK/STAT3-signaling pathways. In contrast， it upregulated the expression of CALML3， GRIN2， and GRIA2 gene expressions， which influence the AMPK and CAMK2 signaling pathways， indicating the potential of BBEE in neurotransmission and synaptic function. Also， immunofluorescence analysis revealed that 2-AB treatment significantly increased PSD-95 and Ca2+levels， suggesting its effect on synaptic transmission essential for brain function.Conclusion:Our findings suggest the potential anti-neuroinflammatory effects of BBEE and 2-AB， which may offer therapeutic and preventive benefits in mitigating neurological disorders. Given that BB is widely consumed in many Asian countries， our study may encourage its incorporation into the daily diet to slow inflammation-induced neurodegenerative disorders， reduce age-related cognitive decline， and enhance overall brain function.Keywords:Black soybean; Neuroinflammation; Proinflammatory cytokine; Synaptic transmission; Transcriptomics.
Deep representation learning of chemical-induced transcriptional profile for phenotype-based drug discovery.,Nat Commun, 2024 Jun 25,38918369,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38918369/,ificial intelligence transforms drug discovery， with phenotype-based approaches emerging as a promising alternative to target-based methods， overcoming limitations like lack of well-defined targets. While chemical-induced transcriptional profiles offer a comprehensive view of drug mechanisms， inherent noise often obscures the true signal， hindering their potential for meaningful insights. Here， we highlight the development of TranSiGen， a deep generative model employing self-supervised representation learning. TranSiGen analyzes basal cell gene expression and molecular structures to reconstruct chemical-induced transcriptional profiles with high accuracy. By capturing both cellular and compound information， TranSiGen-derived representations demonstrate efficacy in diverse downstream tasks like ligand-based virtual screening， drug response prediction， and phenotype-based drug repurposing. Notably， in vitro validation of TranSiGen's application in pancreatic cancer drug discovery highlights its potential for identifying effective compounds. We envisage that integrating TranSiGen into the drug discovery and mechanism research holds significant promise for advancing biomedicine.
Mapping the landscape of genetic dependencies in chordoma.,Nat Commun, 2023 Apr 6,37024492,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37024492/,Identifying the spectrum of genes required for cancer cell survival can reveal essential cancer circuitry and therapeutic targets， but such a map remains incomplete for many cancer types. We apply genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens to map the landscape of selectively essential genes in chordoma， a bone cancer with few validated targets. This approach confirms a known chordoma dependency， TBXT (T; brachyury)， and identifies a range of additional dependencies， including PTPN11， ADAR， PRKRA， LUC7L2， SRRM2， SLC2A1， SLC7A5， FANCM， and THAP1. CDK6， SOX9， and EGFR， genes previously implicated in chordoma biology， are also recovered. We find genomic and transcriptomic features that predict specific dependencies， including interferon-stimulated gene expression， which correlates with ADAR dependence and is elevated in chordoma. Validating the therapeutic relevance of dependencies， small-molecule inhibitors of SHP2， encoded by PTPN11， have potent preclinical efficacy against chordoma. Our results generate an emerging map of chordoma dependencies to enable biological and therapeutic hypotheses.
Molecular landscape， subtypes， and therapeutic vulnerabilities of central nervous system solitary fibrous tumors.,Nat Commun, 2025 Aug 23,40849425,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40849425/,Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare， aggressive mesenchymal neoplasms with high recurrence and metastasis rates. Here， we perform a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of 189 cases of CNS SFTs integrating 94 whole genome sequencing， 88 transcriptomics， 7 single-nucleus RNA sequencing and 3 spatial transcriptome sequencing. We find that receptor tyrosine kinase mutations are significantly more prevalent besides the widespread NAB2-STAT6 fusion and correlate with tumor grade. Transcriptomic analysis reveals four molecular subtypes-classical， neural-like， inflamed and migratory-each associated with distinct clinical and biological characteristics. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing identifies five tumor cell states， with the SFT_classical state serving as a precursor to other states influenced by hypoxia and inflammation. Notably， we identify FER kinase as a key therapeutic target， with FER inhibition significantly reducing tumor cell proliferation， migration and invasion. These findings provide important insights into CNS SFT biology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for this challenging tumor type.
Characterization of transcriptome diversity and in vitro behavior of primary human high-risk breast cells.,Sci Rep, 2022 Apr 22,35459280,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35459280/,Biology and transcriptomes of non-cancerous human mammary epithelial cells at risk for breast cancer development were explored following primary isolation utilizing conditional reprogramming cell technology from mastectomy tissue ipsilateral to invasive breast cancer. Cultures demonstrated consistent categorizable behaviors. Relative viability and mammosphere formation differed between samples but were stable across three different mammary-specific media. E2F cell cycle target genes expression levels were positively correlated with viability and advancing age was inversely associated. Estrogen growth response was associated with Tissue necrosis factor signaling and Interferon alpha response gene enrichment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy exposure significantly altered transcriptomes， shifting them towards expression of genes linked to mammary stem cell formation. Breast cancer prognostic signature sets include genes that in normal development are limited to specific stages of pregnancy or the menstrual cycle. Sample transcriptomes were queried for stage specific gene expression patterns. All cancer samples and a portion of high-risk samples showed overlapping stages reflective of abnormal gene expression patterns， while other high-risk samples exhibited more stage specific patterns. In conclusion， at-risk cells preserve behavioral and transcriptome diversity that could reflect different risk profiles. It is possible that prognostic platforms analogous to those used for breast cancer could be developed for high-risk mammary cells.
Cannabinerol Prevents Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondria Dysfunctions in an In Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease: A Network-Based Transcriptomic Analysis.,Cells, 2024 Jun 10,38920643,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38920643/,Neurodegenerative disorders are affecting millions of people worldwide， impacting the healthcare system of our society. Among them， Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia， characterized by severe cognitive impairments. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD are β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles， as well as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria dysfunctions， which finally lead to apoptosis and neuronal loss. Since， to date， there is no definitive cure， new therapeutic and prevention strategies are of crucial importance. In this scenario， cannabinoids are deeply investigated as promising neuroprotective compounds for AD. In this study， we evaluated the potential neuroprotective role of cannabinerol (CBNR) in an in vitro cellular model of AD via next-generation sequencing. We observed that CBNR pretreatment counteracts the Aβ-induced loss of cell viability of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover， a network-based transcriptomic analysis revealed that CBNR restores normal mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum functions in the AD model. Specifically， the most important genes regulated by CBNR are related mainly to oxidative phosphorylation (COX6B1，OXA1L，MT-CO2，MT-CO3)， protein folding (HSPA5) and degradation (CUL3，FBXW7，UBE2D1)， and glucose (G6PC3) and lipid (HSD17B7，ERG28，SCD) metabolism. Therefore， these results suggest that CBNR could be a new neuroprotective agent helpful in the prevention of AD dysfunctions.Keywords:Alzheimer’s disease; cannabinerol; endoplasmic reticulum; mitochondria; network analysis; phytocannabinoids; transcriptomic analysis.
Transcriptomic signatures of NK cells suggest impaired responsiveness in HIV-1 infection and increased activity post-vaccination.,Nat Commun, 2018 Mar 23,29572470,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29572470/,Natural killer (NK) cells limit viral replication by direct recognition of infected cells， antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)， and releasing cytokines. Although growing evidence supports NK cell antiviral immunity in HIV-1 infection， further knowledge of their response is necessary. Here we show that NK cells responding to models of direct cell recognition， ADCC， and cytokine activation have unique transcriptional fingerprints. Compared with healthy volunteers， individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection have higher expression of genes commonly associated with activation， and lower expression of genes associated with direct cell recognition and cytokine stimulation in their NK cells. By contrast， NK cell transcriptional profiles of individuals receiving a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectored HIV-1 vaccine show upregulation of genes associated with direct cell recognition. These findings demonstrate that targeted transcriptional profiling provides a sensitive assessment of NK cell activity， which helps understand how NK cells respond to viral infections and vaccination.
Systematic characterization of cancer transcriptome at transcript resolution.,Nat Commun, 2022 Nov 10,36357395,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36357395/,Transcribed RNAs undergo various regulation and modification to become functional transcripts. Notably， cancer transcriptome has not been fully characterized at transcript resolution. Herein， we carry out a reference-based transcript assembly across >1000 cancer cell lines. We identify 498，255 transcripts， approximately half of which are unannotated. Unannotated transcripts are closely associated with cancer-related hallmarks and show clinical significance. We build a high-confidence RNA binding protein (RBP)-transcript regulatory network， wherein most RBPs tend to regulate transcripts involved in cell proliferation. We identify numerous transcripts that are highly associated with anti-cancer drug sensitivity. Furthermore， we establish RBP-transcript-drug axes， wherein PTBP1 is experimentally validated to affect the sensitivity to decitabine by regulating KIAA1522-a6 transcript. Finally， we establish a user-friendly data portal to serve as a valuable resource for understanding cancer transcriptome diversity and its potential clinical utility at transcript level. Our study substantially extends cancer RNA repository and will facilitate anti-cancer drug discovery.
Characterization of drug-induced splicing complexity in prostate cancer cell line using long read technology.,Pac Symp Biocomput, 2018,29218865,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29218865/,We characterize the transcriptional splicing landscape of a prostate cancer cell line treated with a previously identified synergistic drug combination. We use a combination of third generation long-read RNA sequencing technology and short-read RNAseq to create a high-fidelity map of expressed isoforms and fusions to quantify splicing events triggered by treatment. We find strong evidence for drug-induced， coherent splicing changes which disrupt the function of oncogenic proteins， and detect novel transcripts arising from previously unreported fusion events.
Recalibrating differential gene expression by genetic dosage variance prioritizes functionally relevant genes.,Genome Res, 2025 Oct 1,40962677,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40962677/,Differential expression (DE) analysis is a widely used method for identifying genes that are functionally relevant for an observed phenotype or biological response. However， typical DE analysis includes selection of genes based on a threshold of fold change in expression under the implicit assumption that all genes are equally sensitive to dosage changes of their transcripts. This tends to favor highly variable genes over more constrained genes where even small changes in expression may be biologically relevant. To address this limitation， we have developed a method to recalibrate each gene's DE fold change based on genetic expression variance observed in the human population. The newly established metric ranks statistically differentially expressed genes， not by nominal change of expression， but by relative change in comparison to natural dosage variation for each gene. We apply our method to RNA sequencing data sets from in vitro stimulus response and neuropsychiatric disease experiments. Compared to the standard approach， our method adjusts the bias in discovery toward highly variable genes and enriches for pathways and biological processes related to metabolic and regulatory activity， indicating a prioritization of functionally relevant driver genes. Tissue-specific recalibration increases detection of known disease-relevant processes. Altogether， our method provides a novel view on DE and contributes toward bridging the existing gap between statistical and biological significance. We believe that this approach will simplify the identification of disease-causing molecular processes and enhance the discovery of therapeutic targets.
Transcriptome insights into newcastle disease virus-mediated eradication of cholangiocarcinoma cells.,PLoS One, 2025 May 6,40327606,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40327606/,Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) has emerged as a promising oncolytic viral therapy for various human cancers; however， its effectiveness against cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains unexplored. This study presents the capability of the lentogenic LaSota strain of NDV to eliminate two CCA cell lines， KKU-055 and KKU-100， as well as the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed alterations in gene expression within several pathways in CCA cells following exposure to the LaSota strain NDV， including those involved in TNF-alpha signaling via NF-kB， interferon alpha response， apoptosis， and IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. We remarkably observed a contrasting alteration in the expression of CXCR4， GRAMD1B， IGFBP4， and TGM2 genes in KKU-055 and KKU-100 cells. In addition， gene network analysis highlighted CCNA2， CDK1， DDX58， DHX58， EXO1， GBP1， IFIH1， IFIT1， IFIT2， IFIT3， IRF7， ISIG15， MX1， OAS1， OAS2， PARP9， TOP2A and XAF1 as potential hub genes influencing the response of CCA cells to NDV LaSota strain. Our findings offer evidence supporting the promise of NDV-based therapies as potential strategies for eliminating CCA cells.
Integrated genomic and transcriptional analysis of the in vitro evolution of telomerase-immortalized urothelial cells (TERT-NHUC).,Genes Chromosomes Cancer, 2009 Aug,19405089,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19405089/,Much progress has been made in identifying the molecular genetic alterations that occur in bladder cancer. However， in many cases the genes targeted by these alterations are not known. Telomerase immortalized human urothelial cells (TERT-NHUC) are a useful resource for in vitro studies of genes involved in urothelial transformation. When cultured under standard conditions they remain genetically stable but when cultured under low-density conditions they exhibit genetic instability and acquire chromosomal alterations. TERT-NHUC from three donors were cultured at low plating density and examined at four time-points during a culture period of 600 days. Analyses included population doubling kinetics， array-based CGH (aCGH)， chromosome counts， fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)， mutation analysis， Affymetrix gene expression analysis， Western blotting for p16， anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity assays. Alterations acquired during continued culture of TERT-NHUC at low density (TERT-NHUC-L) included some observed in urothelial carcinoma (UC) cell lines and primary UC. Examination of gene expression in TERT-NHUC with distinct acquired genetic aberrations may pinpoint genes targeted by these alterations. Data from an aCGH study of UC cell lines and primary tumors were examined for changes in chromosomal regions that also showed alterations in TERT-NHUC-L. Loss of a region on 2q including BOK was identified in UC cell lines and primary tumors. DNER and FRAS1 were identified as potential candidate genes， whose expression is altered independently of the acquisition of any genetic event.
Molecular markers distinguish bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from fibroblasts.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2005 Jun 24,15896330,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15896330/,To characterize mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)， we compared gene expression profiles in human bone marrow MSC (11 lines) and human fibroblasts (4 lines) by RT-PCR and real time PCR. Messenger RNA levels of MHC-DR-alpha， MHC-DR-beta， MHC-DR-associated protein CD74， tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2， and neuroserpin were much higher in MSC than in fibroblasts， even in the presence of large interindividual variations. Those of adrenomedullin， apolipoprotein D， C-type lectin superfamily member-2， collagen type XV alpha1， CUG triplet repeat RNA-binding protein， matrix metalloproteinase-1， protein tyrosine kinase-7， and Sam68-like phosphotyrosine protein/T-STAR were lower in MSC than in fibroblasts. FACS analysis showed that cell surface expression of MHC-DR was also higher in MSC than in fibroblasts. MHC-DR expression decreased after osteogenic differentiation， whereas the expression of adrenomedullin-a potent stimulator of osteoblast activity-along with collagen XV alpha1 and apolipoprotein D increased after osteogenic differentiation. The marker genes identified in this study should be useful for characterization of MSC both in basic and clinical studies.
Drug-induced regulation of target expression.,PLoS Comput Biol, 2010 Sep 9,20838579,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20838579/,Drug perturbations of human cells lead to complex responses upon target binding. One of the known mechanisms is a (positive or negative) feedback loop that adjusts the expression level of the respective target protein. To quantify this mechanism systems-wide in an unbiased way， drug-induced differential expression of drug target mRNA was examined in three cell lines using the Connectivity Map. To overcome various biases in this valuable resource， we have developed a computational normalization and scoring procedure that is applicable to gene expression recording upon heterogeneous drug treatments. In 1290 drug-target relations， corresponding to 466 drugs acting on 167 drug targets studied， 8% of the targets are subject to regulation at the mRNA level. We confirmed systematically that in particular G-protein coupled receptors， when serving as known targets， are regulated upon drug treatment. We further newly identified drug-induced differential regulation of Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase， Endoplasmin， DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha and Calmodulin 1. The feedback regulation in these and other targets is likely to be relevant for the success or failure of the molecular intervention.

The COXEN principle: translating signatures of in vitro chemosensitivity into tools for clinical outcome prediction and drug discovery in cancer.,Cancer Res, 2010 Mar 1,20160033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20160033/,Substantial effort has been devoted to in vitro testing of candidate chemotherapeutic agents. In particular， the United States National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI-DTP) Human Tumor Cell Line Screen has screened hundreds of thousands of compounds and extracts， for which data on more than 40，000 compounds tested on a panel of 60 cancer cell lines (NCI-60) are publically available. In tandem， gene expression profiling has brought about a sea change in our understanding of cancer biology， allowing discovery of biomarkers or signatures able to characterize， classify， and prognosticate clinical behavior of human tumors. Recent studies have used tumor profiling matched to clinical trial outcome data to derive gene expression models predicting therapeutic outcomes， though such efforts are costly， time-consuming， tumor type-specific， and not amenable to rare diseases. Furthermore， addition of new or established drugs to multidrug combinations in which such models are already available requires the entire model to be re-derived. Can the aforementioned in vitro testing platform， coupled to the universal language of genomics， be used to develop， a priori， gene expression models predictive of clinical outcomes? Recent advances， including the CO-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) algorithm， suggest that development of these models may be possible and raise important implications for future trial design and drug discovery.
Analysis of Transcriptome， Selected Intracellular Signaling Pathways， Proliferation and Apoptosis of LNCaP Cells Exposed to High Leptin Concentrations.,Int J Mol Sci, 2019 Oct 30,31671654,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31671654/,Leptin， the first discovered adipokine， has been connected to various physiological and pathophysiological processes， including cancerogenesis. Increasing evidence confirms its influence on prostate cancer cells. However， studies on the effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of the androgen-sensitive LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells brought conflicting results. Therefore， we performed studies on the effects of high LEP concentration (1 × 10-6M) on gene expression profile， change of selected signaling pathways， proliferation and apoptosis of LNCaP cells. RTCA (real-time cell analyzer) revealed inhibitory effect of LEP on cell proliferation， but lower LEP concentrations (10-8and 10-10M) did not affect cell division. Moreover， flow cytometry with a specific antibody for Cleaved PARP-1， an apoptosis marker， confirmed the activation of apoptosis in leptin-exposed LNCaP line of prostate cancer cells. Within 24 h LEP (10-6M) increases expression of 297 genes and decreases expression of 119 genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to functional annotation and clusterization using the DAVID bioinformatics tools. Most ontological groups are associated with proliferation and apoptosis (seven groups)， immune response (six) and extracellular matrix (two). These results were confirmed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The leptin's effect on apoptosis stimulation was also confirmed using Pathview library. These results were also confirmed by qPCR method. The results of Western Blot analysis (exposure to LEP 10 min， 1， 2， 4 and 24 h) suggest (after 24 h) decrease of p38 MAPK， p44-42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Bcl-2 phosphorylated at threonine 56. Moreover， exposure of LNCaP cells to LEP significantly stimulates the secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7). Obtained results suggest activation of apoptotic processes in LNCaP cells cultured at high LEP concentration. At the same time， this activation is accompanied by inhibition of proliferation of the tested cells.Keywords:LNCaP; apoptosis; intracellular signaling pathways; leptin; proliferation; prostate cancer cells; transcriptome analysis.
Differential transcription profiling of the phage LUZ19 infection process in different growth media.,RNA Biol, 2021 Nov,33448239,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33448239/,RNA sequencing of phage-infected bacterial cultures offers a snapshot of transcriptional events occurring during the infection process， providing insights into the phage transcriptional organization as well as the bacterial response. To better mimic real environmental contexts， we performed RNA-seq ofPseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1 cultures infected with phage LUZ19 in a mammalian cell culture medium to better simulate a phage therapy event and the data were compared to lysogeny broth medium. Regardless of the media， phage LUZ19 induces significant transcriptional changes in the bacterial host over time， particularly during early infection (t= 5 min) and gradually shuts down bacterial transcription. In a common response in both media， 56P. aeruginosaPAO1 genes are differentially transcribed and clustered into several functional categories such as metabolism， translation and transcription. Our data allowed us to tease apart a medium-specific response during infection from the identified infection-associated responses. This reinforces the concept that phages overtake bacterial transcriptome in a strict manner to gain control of the bacterial machinery and reallocate resources for infection， in this case overcoming the nutritional limitations of the mammalian cell culture medium. From a phage therapy perspective， this study contributes towards a better understanding of phage-host interaction in human physiological conditions and demonstrates the versatility of phage LUZ19 to adapt to different environments.Keywords:Bacteriophage; P. aeruginosa; RNA-seq; gene expression; transcriptome.
Transcriptome profiling of bovine endometrial epithelial cells induced by lipopolysaccharides in vitro.,Anim Biotechnol, 2023 Dec,36756956,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36756956/,Endometritis is an inflammation of the surface of the endometrium that does not penetrate the submucosa and can cause infertility and increase the elimination rate in cows. Endometrial epithelial cells are the first barrier of the endometrium against foreign stimuli and bacterial infection. Understanding the genetic changes in stimulated endometrial epithelial cells will help in the efforts to prevent and treat endometritis. This study investigated changes in bovine endometrial epithelial (BEEC) gene expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and compared transcriptome-wide gene changes between LPS- and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)- treated BEECs by RNA sequencing. Compared with the PBS group， the LPS group showed 60 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (36 upregulated， 24 downregulated). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that most enrichment occurred during CXCR chemokine receptor binding， inflammatory response， and neutrophil migration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed DEGs mainly concentrated in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions; IL-17， tumor necrosis factor， NOD-like receptor， chemokine， Toll-like receptor， and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways; and the cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathway. Moreover， results revealed that cytokinesSAA3andHPincreased significantly after LPS treatment. These effects of LPS on BEECs transcriptome and the molecular mechanism of endometritis provide a basis for improved clinical treatment and novel drug development.Keywords:Endometritis; high-throughput sequencing; lipopolysaccharide; mRNAs.
Transcriptional atlas of the human immune response to 13 vaccines reveals a common predictor of vaccine-induced antibody responses.,Nat Immunol, 2022 Dec,36316475,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36316475/,
Comparative and temporal transcriptome analysis of peste des petits ruminants virus infected goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,Virus Res, 2017 Feb 2,28017736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28017736/,Peste des petits ruminanats virus (PPRV)， a morbillivirus causes an acute， highly contagious disease - peste des petits ruminants (PPR)， affecting goats and sheep. Sungri/96 vaccine strain is widely used for mass vaccination programs in India against PPR and is considered the most potent vaccine providing long-term immunity. However， occurrence of outbreaks due to emerging PPR viruses may be a challenge. In this study， the temporal dynamics of immune response in goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with Sungri/96 vaccine virus was investigated by transcriptome analysis. Infected goat PBMCs at 48h and 120h post infection revealed 2540 and 2000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)， respectively， on comparison with respective controls. Comparison of the infected samples revealed 1416 DEGs to be altered across time points. Functional analysis of DEGs reflected enrichment of TLR signaling pathways， innate immune response， inflammatory response， positive regulation of signal transduction and cytokine production. The upregulation of innate immune genes during early phase (between 2-5 days) viz. interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)， tripartite motifs (TRIM) and several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected PBMCs and interactome analysis indicated induction of broad-spectrum anti-viral state. Several Transcription factors - IRF3， FOXO3 and SP1 that govern immune regulatory pathways were identified to co-regulate the DEGs. The results from this study， highlighted the involvement of both innate and adaptive immune systems with the enrichment of complement cascade observed at 120h p.i.， suggestive of a link between innate and adaptive immune response. Based on the transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR validation， an in vitro mechanism for the induction of ISGs by IRFs in an interferon independent manner to trigger a robust immune response was predicted in PPRV infection.Keywords:PBMCs; PPRV; Protein-protein interaction networks; RNA-sequencing; Transcription factors; Transcriptome.
Strongly preserved modules between cancer tissue and cell line contribute to drug resistance analysis across multiple cancer types.,Genomics, 2021 May,33647440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33647440/,"The existence and emergence of drug resistance in tumor cells is the main burden of cancer treatment. Most cancer drug resistance analyses are based entirely on cell line data and ignore the discordance between human tumors and cell lines， leading to biased preclinical model transformation. Based on cancer tissue data in TCGA and cancer cell line data in CCLE， this study identified and excluded non-preserved module (NP module) between cancer tissue and cell lines. We used strongly preserved module (SP module) for clinically relevant drug resistance analysis and identified 2068 ""cancer-drug-module"" pairs of 7 cancer types and 212 drugs based on data in GDSC. Furthermore， we identified potentially ineffective combination therapy (PICT) from multiple perspectives. Finally， we found 1608 sets of predictors that can predict drug response. These results provide insights and clues for the clinical selection of effective chemotherapy drugs to overcome cancer resistance in a new perspective.Keywords:Cancer; Cancer cell line; Combination therapy; Drug resistance; Gene expression; Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)."
Comprehensive Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals the Role of the Immune Checkpoint HLA-G Molecule in Cancers.,Front Immunol, 2021 Jul 1,34276642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34276642/,Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is known as a novel immune checkpoint molecule in cancer; thus， HLA-G and its receptors might be targets for immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to systematically identify the roles of checkpoint HLA-G molecules across various types of cancer. ONCOMINE， GEPIA， CCLE， TRRUST， HAP， PrognoScan， Kaplan-Meier Plotter， cBioPortal， LinkedOmics， STRING， GeneMANIA， DAVID， TIMER， and CIBERSORT were utilized. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed. In this study， we comprehensively analysed the heterogeneous expression of HLA-G molecules in various types of cancer and focused on genetic alterations， coexpression patterns， gene interaction networks， HLA-G interactors， and the relationships between HLA-G and pathological stage， prognosis， and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We first identified that the mRNA expression levels of HLA-G were significantly upregulated in both most tumor tissues and tumor cell lines on the basis of in-depth analysis of RNAseq data. The expression levels of HLA-G were positively associated with those of the other immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4. Abnormal expression of HLA-G was significantly correlated with the pathological stage of some but not all tumor types. There was a significant difference between the high and low HLA-G expression groups in terms of overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). The results showed that HLA-G highly expressed have positive associations with tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the microenvironment in most types of tumors (P<0.05). Additionally， we identified the key transcription factor (TF) targets in the regulation of HLA-G expression， including HIVEP2， MYCN， CIITA， MYC， and IRF1. Multiple mutations (missense， truncating， etc.) and the methylation status of theHLA-Ggene may explain the differential expression of HLA-G across different tumors. Functional enrichment analysis showed that HLA-G was primarily related to T cell activation， T cell regulation， and lymphocyte-mediated immunity. The data may provide novel insights for blockade of the HLA-G/ILT axis， which holds potential for the development of more effective antitumour treatments.Keywords:HLA-G; RNAseq; bioinformatics analysis; immune checkpoint; survival; tumor-infiltrating immune cells.
Genomic regulation of invasion by STAT3 in triple negative breast cancer.,Oncotarget, 2017 Jan 31,28030809,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28030809/,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of four molecular subtypes defined by whether the tumor-originating cells are luminal or basal epithelial cells. Breast cancers arising from the luminal mammary duct often express estrogen receptor (ER)， progesterone receptor (PR)， and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2). Tumors expressing ER and/or PR are treated with anti-hormonal therapies， while tumors overexpressing HER2 are targeted with monoclonal antibodies. Immunohistochemical detection of ER， PR， and HER2 receptors/proteins is a critical step in breast cancer diagnosis and guided treatment. Breast tumors that do not express these proteins are known as ""triple negative breast cancer"" (TNBC) and are typically basal-like. TNBCs are the most aggressive subtype， with the highest mortality rates and no targeted therapy， so there is a pressing need to identify important TNBC tumor regulators. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor has been previously implicated as a constitutively active oncogene in TNBC. However， its direct regulatory gene targets and tumorigenic properties have not been well characterized. By integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data from 2 TNBC tumors and 5 cell lines， we discovered novel gene signatures directly regulated by STAT3 that were enriched for processes involving inflammation， immunity， and invasion in TNBC. Functional analysis revealed that STAT3 has a key role regulating invasion and metastasis， a characteristic often associated with TNBC. Our findings suggest therapies targeting STAT3 may be important for preventing TNBC metastasis.Keywords:ChIP-seq; RNA-seq; STAT3; TNBC; invasion."
Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Anti-Tumor Mechanism of Eucalyptol Treatment on Neuroblastoma Cell Line SH-SY5Y.,Neurochem Res, 2022 Dec,36331666,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36331666/,Eucalyptol (1.8-cineole)， an active component in traditional Chinese medicine Artemisia argyi for moxibustion. Previous studies have shown that eucalyptol has anti-tumor effects on leukemia and colon cancer. Nonetheless， the effect and mechanism of eucalyptol on neuroblastoma remains unclear. In the present study， we intended to reveal the effect and mechanism of eucalyptol treatment on the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y through transcriptome analysis. In the group treated with eucalyptol， 566 brain genes were up-regulated， while 757 genes were down-regulated. GO function analysis showed that positive regulation of cell cycle was down-regulated in biological processes. Meanwhile， cancer-related pathways were identified in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis， including pathways in cancer， PI3K-Akt signaling pathway， cAMP signaling pathway， TGF-beta signaling pathway， Hippo signaling pathway， p53 signaling pathway， and additional pathways. Furthermore， we found a key gene， such as MYC， by constructing a network of cancer related pathways with differentially expressed genes and transcription factor analysis. In conclusion， our research indicates that MYC might play a central role in the anit-tumor mechanisms of eucalyptol.Keywords:1.8-cineole; Anti-cancer; Eucalyptol; MYC; Moxibustion; RNAseq.
Transcriptomic analysis of the effect of (E)-3-(3，5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(2-methoxyphenyl) prop-2-en-1-one (DPP23) on reactive oxygen species generation in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells.,Genes Genomics, 2020 Nov,32949369,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32949369/,Background:Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation specifically in cancer cells may be a promising strategy for their selective killing. The synthetic chalcone derivative (E)-3-(3，5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (DPP23) exerts antitumor activity through ROS-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells but not in healthy cells. However， the mechanism underlying ROS generation by DPP23 remains unknown.Objective:The current study aims to identify possible DPP23 target genes responsible for ROS generation through the mining of microarray data stored in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).Methods:A comprehensive expression profile of genes modulated by DPP23 was examined by gene ontology analysis. DPP23-modulated genes in Mia-PaCa2 pancreatic cells were validated by reverse transcription-PCR.Results:Multiple genes were up and downregulated by DPP23 treatment in MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells. Genes with absolute fold-change (FC) of > 2 were selected as the cut-off criteria and grouped into 10 clusters to analyze expression patterns systematically. We observed that genes with increased expression at 6 h were significantly affected by ROS increase， unfolded protein response， and cell death. Expression of 13 genes involved in glutathione metabolism， including CHAC1， GCLC， G6PD， GSTO2， GSTA5， GSTM2， GSR， GPX3/6/8， GGT1， PGD， ATF4， and NAT8B， are modulated by DPP23. Of these， CHAC1 was most highly upregulated upon DPP23 treatment.Conclusion:DPP23 alters global gene expression associated with multiple cellular responses， including oxidative stress and apoptosis. We found that DPP23 may induce GSH depletion through modulation of gene expression， which is especially involved in glutathione metabolism. Of these， CHAC1 emerged as the most prominent candidate for DPP23 as it was the most responsive to DPP23 treatment.Keywords:CHAC1; DPP23; Expression profiles; Glutathione; ROS.

Expression profiling of cell cycle genes in human pancreatic islets with and without type 2 diabetes.,Mol Cell Endocrinol, 2013 Aug 15,23707792,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23707792/,Microarray gene expression data were used to analyze the expression pattern of cyclin， cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKs) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKIs) genes from human pancreatic islets with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Of the cyclin genes， CCNI was the most expressed. Data obtained from microarray and qRT-PCR showed higher expression of CCND1 in diabetic islets. Among the CDKs， CDK4， CDK8 and CDK9 were highly expressed， while CDK1 was expressed at low level. High expression of CDK18 was observed in diabetic islets. Of the CDKIs， CDKN1A expression was higher in diabetic islets in both microarray and qRT-PCR. Expression of CDKN1A， CDKN2A， CCNI2， CDK3 and CDK16 was correlated with age. Finally， eight SNPs in these genes were associated with T2D in the DIAGRAM database. Our data provide a comprehensive expression pattern of cell cycle genes in human islets. More human studies are required to confirm and reproduce animal studies.
Genomic complexity and targeted genes in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines.,Endocr Relat Cancer, 2017 May,28235956,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28235956/,naplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a highly malignant disease with a very short median survival time. Few studies have addressed the underlying somatic mutations， and the genomic landscape of ATC thus remains largely unknown. In the present study， we have ascertained copy number aberrations， gene fusions， gene expression patterns， and mutations in early-passage cells from ten newly established ATC cell lines using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis， RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing. The ATC cell line genomes were highly complex and displayed signs of replicative stress and genomic instability， including massive aneuploidy and frequent breakpoints in the centromeric regions and in fragile sites. Loss of heterozygosity involving whole chromosomes was common， but there were no signs of previous near-haploidisation events or chromothripsis. A total of 21 fusion genes were detected， including six predicted in-frame fusions; none were recurrent. Global gene expression analysis showed 661 genes to be differentially expressed between ATC and papillary thyroid cancer cell lines， with pathway enrichment analyses showing downregulation ofTP53signalling as well as cell adhesion molecules in ATC. Besides previously known driver events， such as mutations inBRAF，NRAS，TP53and theTERTpromoter， we identifiedPTPRDandNEGR1as putative novel target genes in ATC， based on deletions in six and four cell lines， respectively; the latter gene also carried a somatic mutation in one cell line. Taken together， our data provide novel insights into the tumourigenesis of ATC and may be used to identify new therapeutic targets.Keywords:gene expression; molecular genetics; thyroid.
Antitumor effects of a novel photosensitizer-mediated photodynamic therapy and its influence on the cell transcriptome.,Oncol Res, 2024 Apr 23,38686054,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38686054/,Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer treatment. This study investigated the antitumor effects and mechanisms of a novel photosensitizer meso-5-[ρ-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid-aminophenyl]-10，15，20-triphenyl-porphyrin (DTP) mediated PDT (DTP-PDT). Cell viability， reactive oxygen species (ROS)， and apoptosis were measured with a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay， DCFH-DA fluorescent probe， and Hoechst staining， respectively. Cell apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins were examined using western blotting. RNA sequencing was used to screen differentially expressed mRNAs (DERs)， and bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the major biological events after DTP-PDT. Our results show that DTP-PDT inhibited cell growth and induced ROS generation in MCF-7 and SGC7901 cells. The ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and the P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 alleviated DTP-PDT-induced cytotoxicity. DTP-PDT induced cell apoptosis together with upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2， which could also be inhibited by NAC or SB203580. The level of LC3B-II， a marker of autophagy， was increased by DTP-PDT. A total of 3496 DERs were obtained after DTP-PDT. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses indicated that DERs included those involved in cytosolic ribosomes， the nuclear lumen， protein binding， cell cycle， protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum， and ribosomal DNA replication. Disease Ontology and Reactome enrichment analyses indicated that DERs were associated with a variety of cancers and cell cycle checkpoints. Protein-protein interaction results demonstrated thatcdk1andrps27aranked in the top 10 interacting genes. Therefore， DTP-PDT could inhibit cell growth and induce cell apoptosis and autophagy， partly through ROS and the P38 MAPK signaling pathway. Genes associated with the cell cycle， ribosomes， DNA replication， and protein binding may be the key changes in DTP-PDT-mediated cytotoxicity.Keywords:Apoptosis; Autophagy; Bioinformatic analysis; Photodynamic therapy; ROS.
Functional and transcriptomic characterization of cisplatin-resistant AGS and MKN-28 gastric cancer cell lines.,PLoS One, 2020 Jan 28,31990955,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31990955/,Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant cancer-related cause of death worldwide. The most used chemotherapeutic regimen in GC is based on platinum drugs such as cisplatin (CDDP). However， CDDP resistance reduces advanced GC survival. In vitro drug-resistant cell model would help in the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying this drug-resistance phenomenon. The aim of this study was to characterize new models of CDDP-resistant GC cell lines (AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP) obtained through a stepwise increasing drug doses method， in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance as well as identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of GC. Cell viability assays， cell death assays and the expression of resistance molecular markers confirmed that AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP are reliable CDDP-resistant models. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses identified a total of 189 DEGs， including 178 up-regulated genes and 11 down-regulated genes， associated mainly to molecular functions involved in CDDP-resistance. DEGs were enriched in 23 metabolic pathways， among which the most enriched was the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway. Finally， the higher mRNA expression of SERPINA1， BTC and CCL5， three up-regulated DEGs associated to CDDP resistance found by RNA-seq analysis was confirmed. In summary， this study showed that AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP are reliable models of CDDP resistance because resemble many of resistant phenotype in GC， being also useful to assess potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of gastric cancers resistant to CDDP. In addition， we identified several DEGs associated with molecular functions such as binding， catalytic activity， transcription regulator activity and transporter activity， as well as signaling pathways associated with inflammation process， which could be involved in the development of CDDP resistance in GC. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of inflammatory processes in GC resistant to CDDP and these models could be useful for these purposes.
Functional linkage of gene fusions to cancer cell fitness assessed by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9 screening.,Nat Commun, 2019 May 16,31097696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31097696/,Many gene fusions are reported in tumours and for most their role remains unknown. As fusions are used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes， and are targets for treatment， it is crucial to assess their function in cancer. To systematically investigate the role of fusions in tumour cell fitness， we utilized RNA-sequencing data from 1011 human cancer cell lines to functionally link 8354 fusion events with genomic data， sensitivity to >350 anti-cancer drugs and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-fitness effects. Established clinically-relevant fusions were identified. Overall， detection of functional fusions was rare， including those involving cancer driver genes， suggesting that many fusions are dispensable for tumour fitness. Therapeutically actionable fusions involving RAF1， BRD4 and ROS1 were verified in new histologies. In addition， recurrent YAP1-MAML2 fusions were identified as activators of Hippo-pathway signaling in multiple cancer types. Our approach discriminates functional fusions， identifying new drivers of carcinogenesis and fusions that could have clinical implications.
Amprenavir Mitigates Pepsin-Induced Transcriptomic Changes in Normal and Precancerous Esophageal Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2025 Jun 26,40649959,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40649959/,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is associated with inflammatory and neoplastic changes in the esophageal epithelium. Despite widespread PPI use， esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence continues to rise， implicating non-acidic reflux components such as pepsin in disease progression. We performed transcriptomic profiling to assess pepsin-induced changes and the protective effect of amprenavir in vitro. Het-1A (normal) and BAR-T (Barrett's) cells (n= 3) were treated at pH 7.0 with pepsin and/or 10 μM amprenavir for 1 h. RNA-seq identified DEGs (FDR ≤ 0.05， |log₂FC| ≥ 0.375)， and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed enriched pathways. Pepsin exposure altered mitochondrial function， oxidative phosphorylation， epithelial integrity， signaling， and inflammatory pathways in both cell lines. Amprenavir attenuated these transcriptomic perturbations， preserving mitochondrial and stress-response pathways. Notably， BAR-T cells exhibited heightened activation of wound-healing and epithelial repair pathways， whereas Het-1A cells showed greater mitochondrial and systemic stress pathway alterations. Pepsin drives transcriptomic dysregulation in esophageal epithelial cells under non-acidic conditions， and amprenavir shows potential to counteract peptic injury. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore amprenavir's therapeutic utility in GERD management and EAC prevention.Keywords:Barrett’s esophagus; esophageal adenocarcinoma; gastroesophageal reflux; pepsin; transcriptomic analysis.
Transcriptome profile and its partly verification of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells exposed to Yuzhizi () seed extract.,J Tradit Chin Med, 2022 Dec,36378050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36378050/,Objective:To investigate the efficacy of Yuzhizi seed extract (FAQSE) on inhibiting the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and to explore the anti-HCC action mechanism of FAQSE.Methods:Human HCC HepG2 and Huh7 cells were used to investigate the anti-HCC effect of FAQSE. 3-(4， 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2， 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to measure cell viability. Affymetrix microarray was adopted to detect the expression of transcriptome. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of each cell line were identified. For co-DEGs of both cell lines， the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were enriched using the Database for Annotation， Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)， and the network analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) was mapped using the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and Cytoscape software. Some important genes in the PPI network of co-DEGs were selected to verify by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction， Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:FAQSE decreased the viability of HepG2 and Huh7 cells. There were 211 co-upregulated and 86 co-downregualted genes in both cell lines after FAQSE treatment. The enriched GO terms of co-upregulated DEGs were primarily involved cell-cell adhesion， viral process， transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter， positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter and actin cytoskeleton organization. The GO terms of co-downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the processes of SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane， viral transcription， nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process， nonsense-mediated decay， translational initiation and rRNA processing. Main KEGG pathways of co-upregulated DEGs were endocytosis， glutathione metabolism， protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum， synaptic vesicle cycle and lysosome. The major KEGG pathways of co-downregulated DEGs were ribosome， biosynthesis of amino acids， arginine and proline metabolism， systemic lupus erythematosus and complement and coagulation cascades. The top 10 co-DEGs with high hub nodes in STRING analysis were ribosomal protein S27a， transferrin， ribosomal protein S20， ribosomal protein L9， protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B alpha， transthyretin， thioredoxin reductase 1， ribosomal protein L3， ribophorin I and ribosomal protein L24. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also co-downregulated and contained in the PPI network. The mRNA and protein expression of most verified genes was consistent with the results of co-DEGs analysis. And the AFP level was significantly reduced after FAQSE treatment.Conclusions:A series of genes and pathways of HepG2 and Huh7 cells were changed after FAQSE treatment， which might be the targets of FAQSE against HCC and worthy of further study. AFP might be important one of them.Keywords:Yuzhizi seed extract; alpha-fetoprotein; carcinoma， hepatocellular; transcriptome.
Identification of immune subtypes associated with CD8+ T cell-related genes providing new treatment strategies of esophageal carcinoma.,Front Immunol, 2025 Feb 27,40083549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40083549/,Background:CD8+ T lymphocytes greatly affect the efficacy of immunotherapy， displaying promising potential in various tumors. Here， we aimed to identify immune subtypes associated with CD8+ T cell-related genes to predict the efficacy of treatment in esophageal cancer (ESCA).Methods:We obtained 13 immune cell-related datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and removed batch effects. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and co-expression analysis were performed to identify highly correlated CD8+ T cell genes. Cox analysis was used to process ESCA clinical information， and the immune clusters (ICs) were constructed through consensus cluster analysis. Furthermore， we constructed an immune risk score model to predict the prognosis of ESCA based on these CD8+ T cell genes. This model was verified using the IMvigor210 dataset， and we functionally validated the immune risk score modelin vitro.Results:The results revealed significant correlations between CD8+ T cell-related genes and immune-related pathways. Three ICs were identified in ESCA， with IC3 demonstrating the most favorable prognosis. The final 6-gene prognostic risk model exhibited stable predictive performance in datasets across different platforms. Compared with that in normal esophageal epithelial (HEEC cells)， CHMP7 in the 6-gene prognostic risk model was upregulated in KYSE150 and TE-1 cells. Si-CHMP7 transfection led to a decrease in tumor cell migration， invasion， and proliferation， accompanied by an accelerated apoptotic process.Conclusions:Collectively， we identified the immune subtypes of CD8+ T cell-related genes with different prognostic significance. We designated CHMP7 in the 6-gene prognostic risk model as a potential target to improve tumor cell prognosis. These insights provide a strong basis for improving prognosis and facilitating more personalized and accurate treatment decisions for the immunotherapy of ESCA.Keywords:CD8+ T cell; CHMP7; WGCNA; esophageal carcinoma; immune subtype.
Global gene transcriptome analysis in vaccinated cattle revealed a dominant role of IL-22 for protection against bovine tuberculosis.,PLoS Pathog, 2012 Dec,23300440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23300440/,Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis， a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group of bacteria. Vaccination of cattle might offer a long-term solution for controlling the disease and priority has been given to the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB. Identification of biomarkers in tuberculosis research remains elusive and the goal is to identify host correlates of protection. We hypothesized that by studying global gene expression we could identify in vitro predictors of protection that could help to facilitate vaccine development. Calves were vaccinated with BCG or with a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol. Protective efficacy was determined after M. bovis challenge. RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated PBMC prepared from vaccinated-protected， vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle prior to M. bovis challenge and global gene expression determined by RNA-seq. 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared with vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant pathway related to this dataset with IL-22 expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection besides INF-γ. Finally， the expression of these candidate genes identified by RNA-seq was evaluated by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated calves. This experiment confirmed the importance of IL-22 as predictor of vaccine efficacy.
Involvement of the Interferon Signaling Pathways in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.,Anticancer Res, 2020 Aug,32727774,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32727774/,Background/aim:To examine interferon (IFN) signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancer cells and their therapeutic application for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Materials and methods:We examined the effects of IFNα on cytotoxicity， migration， as well as on the levels of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway-associated genes expression in pancreatic cancer cells. We also examined the additive effects of IFNα and poly(I-C) on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced cytotoxicity. We performed transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of clinical samples and compared the profile between pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and PDACs.Results:IFNα suppressed cell viability and cell migration， and affected TLR signaling pathways， in pancreatic cancer cells. TLR3 is one of the potential genes involved in IFN-treated pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore， similar to IFN， extracellular addition of poly(I-C) enhanced TKI-induced cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that IFN signaling is one of the potential pathways involved in the progression of PanIN to PDAC.Conclusion:IFN signaling may be involved in the development of PDAC. Treatments that target the IFN and TLR3 signaling pathways may be therapeutic options against PDAC.Keywords:Interferon; RNA-Seq; TKI; Toll-like receptor; pancreatic cancer.
Transcriptomics analysis of LINC02202/XBP1 axis in melanoma: Implications for drug targeting and PD-1 monoclonal antibody efficacy.,J Cell Mol Med, 2024 Apr,38520212,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38520212/,Malignant melanoma (MM) is a highly aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer， primarily caused by recurrence and metastasis. Therefore， it is crucial to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying melanoma recurrence and metastasis. Our study has identified a potential targeted regulatory relationship between LINC02202， miR-526b-3p and XBP1 in malignant melanoma. Through the regulation of the miR-526b-3p/XBP1 signalling pathway， LINC02202 may play a role in tumour progression and immune infiltration and inhibiting the expression of LINC02202 can increase the efficacy of immunotherapy for melanoma. Our findings shed light on the impact of LINC02202/XBP1 on the phenotype and function of malignant melanoma cells.

Chemosensitivity profile of cancer cell lines and identification of genes determining chemosensitivity by an integrated bioinformatical approach using cDNA arrays.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2005 Mar,15767549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15767549/,We have established a panel of 45 human cancer cell lines (JFCR-45) to explore genes that determine the chemosensitivity of these cell lines to anticancer drugs. JFCR-45 comprises cancer cell lines derived from tumors of three different organs: breast， liver， and stomach. The inclusion of cell lines derived from gastric and hepatic cancers is a major point of novelty of this study. We determined the concentration of 53 anticancer drugs that could induce 50% growth inhibition (GI50) in each cell line. Cluster analysis using the GI50s indicated that JFCR-45 could allow classification of the drugs based on their modes of action， which coincides with previous findings in NCI-60 and JFCR-39. We next investigated gene expression in JFCR-45 and developed an integrated database of chemosensitivity and gene expression in this panel of cell lines. We applied a correlation analysis between gene expression profiles and chemosensitivity profiles， which revealed many candidate genes related to the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. To identify genes that directly determine chemosensitivity， we further tested the ability of these candidate genes to alter sensitivity to anticancer drugs after individually overexpressing each gene in human fibrosarcoma HT1080. We observed that transfection of HT1080 cells with the HSPA1A and JUN genes actually enhanced the sensitivity to mitomycin C， suggesting the direct participation of these genes in mitomycin C sensitivity. These results suggest that an integrated bioinformatical approach using chemosensitivity and gene expression profiling is useful for the identification of genes determining chemosensitivity of cancer cells.
RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis of EHMT2 functions in breast cancer.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2020 Apr 9,32033749,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033749/,For breast cancer treatment， hormone therapy is effective for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer but not for TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer). Thus， many researchers have attempted to identify more effective therapeutic candidates for all subtypes of breast cancer. In this study， we established an RNA-seq analytical pipeline to analyze the subtype-specific functions of EHMT2 in the MB231 and MCF7 cell lines. After EHMT2 knockdown， we identified subtype-specific DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and overlapping DEGs. Through GO (Gene Ontology) analysis， GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis)， and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis using the DEGs， we identified the subtype-specific functions of EHMT2 in the MB231 and MCF7 cell lines. Therefore， herein， we suggest that EHMT2 is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of all types of breast cancer.Keywords:Breast cancer; EHMT2; RNA-seq.
Unveiling novel targets of paclitaxel resistance by single molecule long-read RNA sequencing in breast cancer.,Sci Rep, 2019 Apr 15,30988345,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30988345/,RNA sequencing has become one of the most common technology to study transcriptomes in cancer， whereas its length limits its application on alternative splicing (AS) events and novel isoforms. Firstly， we applied single molecule long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-seq) and de novo assembly with short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in both wild type (231-WT) and paclitaxel resistant type (231-PTX) of human breast cancer cell MDA-MBA-231. The two sequencing technology provide both the accurate transcript sequences and the deep transcript coverage. Then we combined shor-read and long-read RNA-seq to analyze alternative events and novel isoforms. Last but not the least， we selected BAK1 as our candidate target to verify our analysis. Our results implied that improved characterization of cancer genomic function may require the application of the single molecule long-read RNA sequencing to get the deeper and more precise view to transcriptional level.

Gene expression profiling in myelodysplastic syndrome after SPARC overexpression associated with Ara-C.,Oncol Rep, 2015 Oct,26238482,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26238482/,Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is involved in many biological processes， including erythropoiesis and cell proliferation. However， the role of SPARC in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains to be elucidated. Pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is among the most effective agents used in the treatment of acute leukemia. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the chemotherapeutic activity of Ara-C was enhanced by the overexpression of SPARC. DNA microarray technology and RNA sequencing were employed to examine differential gene expression in the apoptosis signaling pathway after gene change occurred in cells following drug treatment. The results showed that upregulation of the expression of SPARC induced SKM-1 cell death and inhibited proliferation. Additionally， the apoptotic rate of SPARC overexpression combined with Ara-C increased significantly. Transcription factors CPBP and ZNF333 regulated the 69 genes and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Moreover， the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related genes in the DNA microarray results were increased. These results suggest that SPARC expression changes with Ara-C， revealing a possible application in the treatment of MDS.
Estrogen-independent molecular actions of mutant estrogen receptor 1 in endometrial cancer.,Genome Res, 2019 Sep,31362937,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31362937/,Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations have been identified in hormone therapy-resistant breast cancer and primary endometrial cancer. Analyses in breast cancer suggest that mutant ESR1 exhibits estrogen-independent activity. In endometrial cancer，ESR1mutations are associated with worse outcomes and less obesity， however， experimental investigation of these mutations has not been performed. Using a unique CRISPR/Cas9 strategy， we introduced the D538G mutation， a common endometrial cancer mutation that alters the ligand binding domain of ESR1， while epitope tagging the endogenous locus. We discovered estrogen-independent mutant ESR1 genomic binding that is significantly altered from wild-type ESR1. The D538G mutation impacted expression， including a large set of nonestrogen-regulated genes， and chromatin accessibility， with most affected loci bound by mutant ESR1. Mutant ESR1 is distinct from constitutive ESR1 activity because mutant-specific changes are not recapitulated with prolonged estrogen exposure. Overall， the D538G mutantESR1confers estrogen-independent activity while causing additional regulatory changes in endometrial cancer cells that are distinct from breast cancer cells.
Transcriptional study after Beauvericin and Enniatin B combined exposure in Jurkat T cells.,Food Chem Toxicol, 2019 Aug,31100301,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31100301/,Simultaneous mycotoxins toxicity is complex and non-predictable based on their individual toxicities. Beauvericin and Enniatins are emerging mycotoxins highly co-occurrent in food and feed， and their cytotoxicity has been reported in several human cell lines. RNA-seq studies of individual exposure in Jurkat cells demonstrated human genome perturbation mainly affecting mitochondrial pathways， however， both mycotoxins showed differences between their toxic responses. This study investigates the transcriptional effects of combined exposure to Beauvericin and Enniatin B (1:1) (0.1， 0.5， 1.5 μM; 24 h) in Jurkat cells by qPCR on 30 selected target genes (10 mitochondrial， 20 nuclear). Gene expression after combined and individual exposures were compared and functional data analysis (ToxPi) on the most relevant biological processes (cycle and apoptosis regulation; cholesterol metabolism and transport; cellular signaling transduction; cellular stress responses; immune regulation; protein metabolism; retinoic acid metabolism; transcription regulation) was applied to RNA-seq data from individual exposure (1.5， 3， 5 μM; 24 h; Jurkat cells). Transcriptional changes， especially at mitochondrial level， were observed after Beauvericin-Enniatin B co-exposure including down-regulation of antioxidant activity related genes. Different expression patterns between combined and individual exposures were identified. ToxPi analysis confirmed different dose-dependent relationship profiles between these two mycotoxins after individual exposure.Keywords:Beauvericin; Enniatin B; In vitro; Mitochondria; ToxPi; qPCR.
Genomic analysis of drug resistant pancreatic cancer cell line by combining long non-coding RNA and mRNA expression profling.,Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 2015 Jan 1,25755691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25755691/,Recently， more and more studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a very important role in various biological processes. However， research on lncRNA in the tumor cell drug resistance of it is seldom reported. In this study， gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line SWl990/GZ was obtained by treating parental cell line SWl990 in vitro with increasing dosage of gemcitabine in culture medium intermittently for ten months. We identified 4983 of 13310 detected lncRNAs demonstrated > 2-fold abnormally expressed in response to the gemcitabine-resistant， among of them， 1993 and 2990 lncRNAs were upregulated and downregulated. Meanwhile， 4759 mRNAs exhibited at least a 2-fold， of these， 2671 and 2088 mRNAs were upregulated and downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis and Pathway analysis revealed that differential expression mRNA involved in significant biological regulatory function and some genes may be particular to pancreatic cancer chemotherapy resistance. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the changes of six lncRNAs (RP11-58D2.1， lincRNA-ZNF532， AP000221.1， CTC-338M12.5， CR619813， DDX6P) and nine mRNAs (SYT1， FAM171B， ZNF331， FAM187B， CYP1A1， SRXN1， HIST1H2BL， TOMM40L and SPP1) in SW1990 and SW1990/GZ. We also found that the upregulating of gemcitabine on the expression of lincRNA-ZNF532 was time-dependent. Gemcitabine at a range from 1.0 μM to 16.0 μM induced a increase of lincRNA-ZNF532 in SW1990 cells. The relative level of DDX6P is opposite to that of lincRNA-ZNF53 in the same circumstance. In conclusion， the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs identified in this work may represent good candidates for future diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.Keywords:Pancreatic cancer; drug-resistant; expression profle; lncRNA; mRNA.
A functional module states framework reveals transcriptional states for drug and target prediction.,Cell Rep, 2022 Jan 18,35045296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35045296/,Cells are complex systems in which many functions are performed by different genetically defined and encoded functional modules. To systematically understand how these modules respond to drug or genetic perturbations， we develop a functional module states framework. Using this framework， we (1) define the drug-induced transcriptional state space for breast cancer cell lines using large public gene expression datasets and reveal that the transcriptional states are associated with drug concentration and drug targets， (2) identify potential targetable vulnerabilities through integrative analysis of transcriptional states after drug treatment and gene knockdown-associated cancer dependency， and (3) use functional module states to predict transcriptional state-dependent drug sensitivity and build prediction models for drug response. This approach demonstrates a similar prediction performance as approaches using high-dimensional gene expression values， with the added advantage of more clearly revealing biologically relevant transcriptional states and key regulators.Keywords:cell states; drug response prediction; functional states; machine learning; target prediction.
Transdifferentiation of periodontal ligament-derived stem cells into retinal ganglion-like cells and its microRNA signature.,Sci Rep, 2015 Nov 9,26549845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26549845/,Retinal diseases are the leading causes of irreversible visual impairment and blindness in the developed countries. Human retina has limited regenerative power to replace cell loss. Stem cell replacement therapy has been proposed as a viable option. Previously， we have induced human adult periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) to the retinal lineage. In this study， we modified our induction protocol to direct human adult PDLSCs into retinal ganglion-like cells and determined the microRNA (miRNA) signature of this transdifferentiation process. The differentiated PDLSCs demonstrated the characteristics of functional neurons as they expressed neuronal and retinal ganglion cell markers (ATOH7， POU4F2， β-III tubulin， MAP2， TAU， NEUROD1 and SIX3)， formed synapses and showed glutamate-induced calcium responses as well as spontaneous electrical activities. The global miRNA expression profiling identified 44 upregulated and 27 downregulated human miRNAs after retinal induction. Gene ontology analysis of the predicted miRNA target genes confirmed the transdifferentiation is closely related to neuronal differentiation processes. Furthermore， the expressions of 2 miRNA-targeted candidates， VEGF and PTEN， were significantly upregulated during the induction process. This study identified the transdifferentiation process of human adult stem cells into retinal ganglion-like cells and revealed the involvement of both genetic and miRNA regulatory mechanisms.
Current therapy and the evolving molecular landscape of paediatric ependymoma.,Eur J Cancer, 2017 Jan,27866097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27866097/,Ependymomas are the third commonest paediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumour， accounting for 6-12% of brain tumours in children. The management of these tumours has seen considerable changes over the last two decades， leading to a significant improvement in outcomes. However， despite advances in neurosurgical， neuroimaging and postoperative adjuvant therapy， management of these tumours remain challenging， and recurrence occurs in over 50% of cases， particularly when complete resection is not achieved prior to conformal radiotherapy. To-date no chemotherapeutic regimen has proven to be of significant clinical benefit. Predicting tumour behaviour and defining robust correlates of disease outcome based on histopathology and clinical characteristics remains suboptimal. Paucity of cell lines， failure to develop ideal animal models of these tumours， have precluded better understanding of the oncogenic drivers， undermining development of targeted therapies. Over the last few years breakthrough in the understanding of the molecular biology， are now providing clues to therapeutic insights. It is clear that even with histopathological similarities， these are genetically heterogeneous tumours with diverse clinical outcomes. Rapid evolution of data based on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns， have now identified nine molecular subgroups in these tumours， across three anatomic compartments which include supratentorial (ST)， posterior fossa (PF) and the spinal locations. More recently based on transcriptome profiling， two subgroups (group A and B) of PF ependymoma have been identified with distinct molecular， clinical characteristics and specific chromosomal aberrations. This review includes current management， evolving molecular biology and the shifting paradigm of treatment profile that targets molecular alterations in paediatric ependymoma.Keywords:Current therapy; Molecular biology; Paediatric ependymoma; Therapeutic insights.
Amplification of 9p24.1 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identifies a unique subset of cases that resemble primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.,Blood Cancer J, 2019 Aug 30,31471540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471540/,Copy number alterations (CNAs) of 9p24.1 occur frequently in Hodgkin lymphoma， primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL)， primary central nervous system lymphoma， and primary testicular lymphoma， resulting in overexpression of PD-L1 and sensitivity to PD-1 blockade-based immunotherapy. While 9p24.1 CNA was also reported in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)， little is known about its molecular or clinical significance. In this study， we analyzed the prevalence of 9p24.1 CNA in newly diagnosed DLBCL and examined its association with PD-L1， PD-L2， and JAK2 expression， clinical characteristics， and outcome. We found that 10% of DLBCL cases had CNA of 9p24.1， with 6.5% gains， and 3.5% amplifications. Only the cases with a 9p24.1 amplification had high levels of PD-L1， PD-L2， and JAK2 expression. Gains or amplifications of 9p24.1 were associated with a younger age and the ABC/non-GCB subtype. Compared with DLBCL cases without 9p24.1 CNA， the cases with a 9p24.1 amplification had a trend of better event-free survival. Furthermore， the amplification cases had a gene expression and mutation profile similar to those of PMBCL. Our data suggest that amplification of 9p24.1 identifies a unique subset of DLBCL with clinical and molecular features resembling PMBCL that may be amenable to PD-1 blockade-based immunotherapy.

Metformin Affects the Transcriptomic Profile of Chicken Ovarian Cancer Cells.,Genes (Basel), 2021 Dec 23,35052372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35052372/,Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in women. Metformin intake is associated with a reduced incidence of ovarian cancer and increased overall survival rate. We determined the effect of metformin on sphere formation， extracellular matrix invasion， and transcriptome profile of ovarian cancer cells (COVCAR) isolated from ascites of chickens that naturally developed ovarian cancer. We found that metformin treatment significantly decreased sphere formation and invasiveness of COVCAR cells. RNA-Seq data analysis revealed 0， 4， 365 differentially expressed genes in cells treated with 0.5， 1， 2 mM metformin， respectively compared to controls. Transcriptomic and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed significant downregulation ofMMP7，AICDA，GDPD2，APOC3，APOA1and predicted inhibition of upstream regulatorsNFKB，STAT3，TP53that are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition， DNA repair， and lipid metabolism. The analysis revealed significant upregulation ofRASD2，IHH，CRABP-1and predicted activation of upstream regulators VEGF and E2F1 that are associated with angiogenesis and cell cycle. Causal network analysis revealed novel pathways suggesting predicted inhibition of ovarian cancer through master regulatorASCL1and dataset genesDCX，SEMA6B，HEY2， andKCNIP2. In summary， advanced pathway analysis in IPA revealed novel target genes， upstream regulators， and pathways affected by metformin treatment of COVCAR cells.Keywords:animal models; metformin; ovarian cancer; transcriptomics.
Exosomal-microRNA transcriptome profiling of Parental and CSC-like MDA-MB-231 cells in response to cisplatin treatment.,Pathol Res Pract, 2022 May,35398617,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35398617/,Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with higher risk of metastasis and cancer reoccurrence. Cisplatin is one of the potential anticancer drugs for treating TNBC， where its effectiveness remains challenged by frequent occurrence of cisplatin resistance. Since acquirement of drug resistance often being associated with presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs)， investigation has been conducted， suggesting CSC-like subpopulation to be more resistant to cisplatin than their parental counterpart. On the other hand， plethora evidences showed the transmission of exosomal-miRNAs are capable of promoting drug resistance in breast cancers. In this study， we aim to elucidate the differential expression of exosomal-microRNAs profile and reveal the potential target genes in correlation to cisplatin resistance associated with CSC-like subpopulation by using TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231). Utilizing next generation sequencing and Nanostring techniques， cisplatin-induced dysregulation of exosomal-miRNAs were evaluated in maximal for CSC-like subpopulation as compared to parental cells. Intriguingly， more oncogenic exosomal-miRNAs profile was detected from treated CSC-like subpopulation， which may correlate to enhancement of drug resistance and maintenance of CSCs. In treated CSC-like subpopulation， unique clusters of exosomal-miRNAs namely miR-221-3p， miR-196a-5p， miR-17-5p and miR-126-3p were predicted to target on six genes (ATXN1， LATS1， GSK3β， ITGA6， JAG1 and MYC)， aligned with previous finding which demonstrated dysregulation of these genes in treated CSC-like subpopulation. Our results highlight the potential correlation of exosomal-miRNAs and their target genes as well as novel perspectives of the corresponding pathways that may be essential to contribute to the attenuated cytotoxicity of cisplatin in CSC-like subpopulation.Keywords:Cancer stem cells; Cisplatin resistance; Exosomal-miRNAs; Triple negative breast cancer.
Transcriptomic response of breast cancer cells to anacardic acid.,Sci Rep, 2018 May 23,29795261,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29795261/,nacardic acid (AnAc)， a potential dietary agent for preventing and treating breast cancer， inhibited the proliferation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells. To characterize potential regulators of AnAc action， MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 6 h with purified AnAc 24:1n5 congener followed by next generation transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) and network analysis. We reported that AnAc-differentially regulated miRNA transcriptomes in each cell line and now identify AnAc-regulated changes in mRNA and lncRNA transcript expression. In MCF-7 cells， 80 AnAc-responsive genes were identified， including lncRNA MIR22HG. More AnAc-responsive genes (886) were identified in MDA-MB-231 cells. Only six genes were commonly altered by AnAc in both cell lines: SCD， INSIG1， and TGM2 were decreased and PDK4， GPR176， and ZBT20 were increased. Modeling of AnAc-induced gene changes suggests that AnAc inhibits monounsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in both cell lines and increases endoplasmic reticulum stress in MDA-MB-231 cells. Since modeling of downregulated genes implicated NFκB in MCF-7， we confirmed that AnAc inhibited TNFα-induced NFκB reporter activity in MCF-7 cells. These data identify new targets and pathways that may account for AnAc's anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity.
Identification of novel molecular markers through transcriptomic analysis in human fetal and adult corneal endothelial cells.,Hum Mol Genet, 2013 Apr 1,23257286,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23257286/,The corneal endothelium is composed of a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells (CECs)， which is essential for maintaining corneal transparency. To better characterize CECs in different developmental stages， we profiled mRNA transcriptomes in human fetal and adult corneal endothelium with the goal to identify novel molecular markers in these cells. By comparing CECs with 12 other tissue types， we identified 245 and 284 signature genes that are highly expressed in fetal and adult CECs， respectively. Functionally， these genes are enriched in pathways characteristic of CECs， including inorganic anion transmembrane transporter， extracellular matrix structural constituent and cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor activity. Importantly， several of these genes are disease target genes in hereditary corneal dystrophies， consistent with their functional significance in CEC physiology. We also identified stage-specific markers associated with CEC development， such as specific members in the transforming growth factor beta and Wnt signaling pathways only expressed in fetal， but not in adult CECs. Lastly， by the immunohistochemistry of ocular tissues， we demonstrated the unique protein localization for Wnt5a， S100A4， S100A6 and IER3， the four novel markers for fetal and adult CECs. The identification of a new panel of stage-specific markers for CECs would be very useful for characterizing CECs derived from stem cells or ex vivo expansion for cell replacement therapy.
Prioritizing therapeutics for lung cancer: an integrative meta-analysis of cancer gene signatures and chemogenomic data.,PLoS Comput Biol, 2015 Mar 18,25786242,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25786242/,Repurposing FDA-approved drugs with the aid of gene signatures of disease can accelerate the development of new therapeutics. A major challenge to developing reliable drug predictions is heterogeneity. Different gene signatures of the same disease or drug treatment often show poor overlap across studies， as a consequence of both biological and technical variability， and this can affect the quality and reproducibility of computational drug predictions. Existing algorithms for signature-based drug repurposing use only individual signatures as input. But for many diseases， there are dozens of signatures in the public domain. Methods that exploit all available transcriptional knowledge on a disease should produce improved drug predictions. Here， we adapt an established meta-analysis framework to address the problem of drug repurposing using an ensemble of disease signatures. Our computational pipeline takes as input a collection of disease signatures， and outputs a list of drugs predicted to consistently reverse pathological gene changes. We apply our method to conduct the largest and most systematic repurposing study on lung cancer transcriptomes， using 21 signatures. We show that scaling up transcriptional knowledge significantly increases the reproducibility of top drug hits， from 44% to 78%. We extensively characterize drug hits in silico， demonstrating that they slow growth significantly in nine lung cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection， and identify CALM1 and PLA2G4A as promising drug targets for lung cancer. Our meta-analysis pipeline is general， and applicable to any disease context; it can be applied to improve the results of signature-based drug repurposing by leveraging the large number of disease signatures in the public domain.
G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4-induced cellular senescence and its senescence-associated gene expression profiling.,Exp Cell Res, 2017 Nov 15,28912086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28912086/,Senescent cells have lost their capacity for proliferation and manifest as irreversibly in cell cycle arrest. Many membrane receptors， including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)， initiate a variety of intracellular signaling cascades modulating cell division and potentially play roles in triggering cellular senescence response. GPCR kinases (GRKs) belong to a family of serine/threonine kinases. Although their role in homologous desensitization of activated GPCRs is well established， the involvement of the kinases in cell proliferation is still largely unknown. In this study， we isolated GRK4-GFP expressing HEK293 cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found that the ectopic expression of GRK4 halted cell proliferation. Cells expressing GRK4 (GRK4(+)) demonstrated cell cycle G1/G0 phase arrest， accompanied with significant increase of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity. Expression profiling analysis of 78 senescence-related genes by qRT-PCR showed a total of 17 genes significantly changed in GRK4(+) cells (≥ 2 fold， p < 0.05). Among these， 9 genes - AKT1， p16INK4， p27KIP1， p19INK4， IGFBP3， MAPK14， PLAU， THBS1， TP73 - were up-regulated， while 8 genes， Cyclin A2， Cyclin D1， CDK2， CDK6， ETS1， NBN， RB1， SIRT1， were down-regulated. The increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16， p27) and p38 MAPK proteins (MAPK14) was validated by immunoblotting. Neither p53 nor p21Waf1/Cip1protein was detectable， suggesting no p53 activation in the HEK293 cells. These results unveil a novel function of GRK4 on triggering a p53-independent cellular senescence， which involves an intricate signaling network.Keywords:Cellular senescence; G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4; Gene expression profiling; p53-independent senescence.
Oxytocin's anti-inflammatory and proimmune functions in COVID-19: a transcriptomic signature-based approach.,Physiol Genomics, 2020 Sep 1,32809918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32809918/,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic， infecting over 16 million people worldwide with a significant mortality rate. However， there is no current Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that treats coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here， we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)， we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin， an OXT agonist， and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1β and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation， attenuating T cell inhibition， and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine， both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.Keywords:COVID19; LINCS; immune; oxytocin; transcriptomic signature.
Next-generation sequencing reveals low-dose effects of cationic dendrimers in primary human bronchial epithelial cells.,ACS Nano, 2015 Jan 27,25530437,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25530437/,Gene expression profiling has developed rapidly in recent years with the advent of deep sequencing technologies such as RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) and could be harnessed to predict and define mechanisms of toxicity of chemicals and nanomaterials. However， the full potential of these technologies in (nano)toxicology is yet to be realized. Here， we show that systems biology approaches can uncover mechanisms underlying cellular responses to nanomaterials. Using RNA Seq and computational approaches， we found that cationic poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM-NH2) are capable of triggering down-regulation of cell-cycle-related genes in primary human bronchial epithelial cells at doses that do not elicit acute cytotoxicity， as demonstrated using conventional cell viability assays， while gene transcription was not affected by neutral PAMAM-OH dendrimers. The PAMAMs were internalized in an active manner by lung cells and localized mainly in lysosomes; amine-terminated dendrimers were internalized more efficiently when compared to the hydroxyl-terminated dendrimers. Upstream regulator analysis implicated NF-κB as a putative transcriptional regulator， and subsequent cell-based assays confirmed that PAMAM-NH2 caused NF-κB-dependent cell cycle arrest. However， PAMAM-NH2 did not affect cell cycle progression in the human A549 adenocarcinoma cell line. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying systems biology approaches to predict cellular responses to nanomaterials and highlight the importance of using relevant (primary) cell models.Keywords:nanotoxicology; next-generation sequencing; poly(amidoamine) dendrimers; systems biology.
Transcriptome-based drug repositioning identifies TPCA-1 as a potential selective inhibitor of esophagus squamous carcinoma cell viability.,Int J Mol Med, 2022 Jun,35417037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35417037/,Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a cancer type with limited treatment options. The present study aimed to screen for small molecules that may inhibit ESCC cell viability. The small‑molecule‑perturbed signatures were extrapolated from the library of integrated network‑based cellular signatures (LINCS) database. Since LINCS does not include small‑molecule‑perturbed signatures of ESCC cells， it was hypothesized that non‑ESCC cell lines that display transcriptome profiles similar to those of ESCC may have similar small‑molecule‑perturbated responses to ESCC cells and that identifying small molecules that inhibit the viability of these non‑ESCC cells may also inhibit the viability of ESCC cells. The transcriptomes of >1，000 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database were analyzed and 70 non‑ESCC cell lines exhibiting similar transcriptome profiles to those of ESCC cells were identified. Among them， six cell lines with transcriptome signatures upon drug perturbation were available in the LINCS， which were used as reference signatures. A total of 20 ESCC datasets were analyzed and 522 downregulated and 461 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were consistently altered across >50% of the datasets were identified. These DEGs together with the reference signatures were then used as inputs of the ZhangScore method to score small molecules that may reverse transcriptome alterations of ESCC. Among the top‑ranked 50 molecules identified by the ZhangScore， four candidates that may inhibit ESCC cell viability were experimentally verified. Furthermore， 2‑[(aminocarbonyl)amino]‑5‑(4‑fluorophenyl)‑3‑-thiophenecarboxamide (TPCA‑1)， an inhibitor of the NF‑κB pathway， was able to preferentially inhibit the viability of ESCC cells compared with non‑tumorigenic epithelial Het‑1A cells. Mechanistically， TPCA‑1 induced ESCC KYSE‑450 cell apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF‑κB kinase subunit β， leading to IκBα stabilization and NF‑κB signaling pathway inhibition. Collectively， these results demonstrated that LINCS‑based drug repositioning may facilitate drug discovery and that TPCA‑1 may be a promising candidate molecule in the treatment of ESCC.Keywords:ZhangScore; drug discovery; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; gene expression profiling; library of integrated network‑based cellular signatures.

Transcriptome Analysis of Cisplatin， Cannabidiol， and Intermittent Serum Starvation Alone and in Various Combinations on Colorectal Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2023 Sep 29,37834191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37834191/,Platinum-derived chemotherapy medications are often combined with other conventional therapies for treating different tumors， including colorectal cancer. However， the development of drug resistance and multiple adverse effects remain common in clinical settings. Thus， there is a necessity to find novel treatments and drug combinations that could effectively target colorectal cancer cells and lower the probability of disease relapse. To find potential synergistic interaction， we designed multiple different combinations between cisplatin， cannabidiol， and intermittent serum starvation on colorectal cancer cell lines. Based on the cell viability assay， we found that combinations between cannabidiol and intermittent serum starvation， cisplatin and intermittent serum starvation， as well as cisplatin， cannabidiol， and intermittent serum starvation can work in a synergistic fashion on different colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore， we analyzed differentially expressed genes and affected pathways in colorectal cancer cell lines to understand further the potential molecular mechanisms behind the treatments and their interactions. We found that synergistic interaction between cannabidiol and intermittent serum starvation can be related to changes in the transcription of genes responsible for cell metabolism and cancer's stress pathways. Moreover， when we added cisplatin to the treatments， there was a strong enrichment of genes taking part in G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.Keywords:cannabidiol; cisplatin; colorectal cancer; intermittent fasting; serum starvation.
Transcriptomic and Functional Approaches Unveil the Role of tmRNA in Zinc Acetate Mediated Levofloxacin Sensitivity in Helicobacter pylori.,Microbiol Spectr, 2022 Dec 21,36354329,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36354329/,
Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of molecularly targeted drugs in cancer for target pathway evaluation.,Cancer Sci, 2015 Jul,25911996,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25911996/,Targeted therapy is a rational and promising strategy for the treatment of advanced cancer. For the development of clinical agents targeting oncogenic signaling pathways， it is important to define the specificity of compounds to the target molecular pathway. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis is an unbiased approach to evaluate the compound mode of action， but it is still unknown whether the analysis could be widely applicable to classify molecularly targeted anticancer agents. We comprehensively obtained and analyzed 129 transcriptomic datasets of cancer cells treated with 83 anticancer drugs or related agents， covering most clinically used， molecularly targeted drugs alongside promising inhibitors of molecular cancer targets. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis revealed that compounds targeting similar target molecules or pathways were clustered together. These results confirmed that the gene signatures of these drugs reflected their modes of action. Of note， inhibitors of oncogenic kinase pathways formed a large unique cluster， showing that these agents affect a shared molecular pathway distinct from classical antitumor agents and other classes of agents. The gene signature analysis further classified kinome-targeting agents depending on their target signaling pathways， and we identified target pathway-selective signature gene sets. The gene expression analysis was also valuable in uncovering unexpected target pathways of some anticancer agents. These results indicate that comprehensive transcriptomic analysis with our database (http://scads.jfcr.or.jp/db/cs/) is a powerful strategy to validate and re-evaluate the target pathways of anticancer compounds.Keywords:Antitumor agents; computational biology; gene expression profiling; molecular targeted therapy; protein kinase inhibitors.
Effective Alu repeat based RT-Qpcr normalization in cancer cell perturbation experiments.,PLoS One, 2013 Aug 14,23977142,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23977142/,Background:Measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) levels using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is common practice in many laboratories. A specific set of mRNAs as internal control reference genes is considered as the preferred strategy to normalize RT-qPCR data. Proper selection of reference genes is a critical issue， especially in cancer cells that are subjected to different in vitro manipulations. These manipulations may result in dramatic alterations in gene expression levels， even of assumed reference genes. In this study， we evaluated the expression levels of 11 commonly used reference genes as internal controls for normalization of 19 experiments that include neuroblastoma， T-ALL， melanoma， breast cancer， non small cell lung cancer (NSCL)， acute myeloid leukemia (AML)， prostate cancer， colorectal cancer， and cervical cancer cell lines subjected to various perturbations.Results:The geNorm algorithm in the software package qbase+ was used to rank the candidate reference genes according to their expression stability. We observed that the stability of most of the candidate reference genes varies greatly in perturbation experiments. Expressed Alu repeats show relatively stable expression regardless of experimental condition. These Alu repeats are ranked among the best reference assays in all perturbation experiments and display acceptable average expression stability values (M<0.5).Conclusions:We propose the use of Alu repeats as a reference assay when performing cancer cell perturbation experiments.
Chemosensitivity prediction by transcriptional profiling.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2001 Sep 11,11553813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11553813/,In an effort to develop a genomics-based approach to the prediction of drug response， we have developed an algorithm for classification of cell line chemosensitivity based on gene expression profiles alone. Using oligonucleotide microarrays， the expression levels of 6，817 genes were measured in a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) for which the chemosensitivity profiles of thousands of chemical compounds have been determined. We sought to determine whether the gene expression signatures of untreated cells were sufficient for the prediction of chemosensitivity. Gene expression-based classifiers of sensitivity or resistance for 232 compounds were generated and then evaluated on independent sets of data. The classifiers were designed to be independent of the cells' tissue of origin. The accuracy of chemosensitivity prediction was considerably better than would be expected by chance. Eighty-eight of 232 expression-based classifiers performed accurately (with P < 0.05) on an independent test set， whereas only 12 of the 232 would be expected to do so by chance. These results suggest that at least for a subset of compounds genomic approaches to chemosensitivity prediction are feasible.
Short-term metformin ingestion by healthy older adults improves myoblast function.,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 2021 Apr 1,33406027,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33406027/,"Muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) in aged muscle exhibit impaired activation into proliferating myoblasts， thereby impairing fusion and changes in secreted factors. The antihyperglycemic drug metformin， currently studied as a candidate antiaging therapy， may have potential to promote function of aged MPCs. We evaluated the impact of 2 wk of metformin ingestion on primary myoblast function measured in vitro after being extracted from muscle biopsies of older adult participants. MPCs were isolated from muscle biopsies of community-dwelling older (4 male/4 female， ∼69 yr) adult participants before (pre) and after (post) the metformin ingestion period and studied in vitro. Cells were extracted from Young participants (4 male/4 female， ∼27 yr) to serve as a ""youthful"" comparator. MPCs from Old subjects had lower fusion index and myoblast-endothelial cell homing compared with Young， while Old MPCs， extracted after short-term metformin ingestion， performed better at both tasks. Transcriptomic analyses of Old MPCs (vs. Young) revealed decreased histone expression and increased myogenic pathway activity， yet this phenotype was partially restored by metformin. However， metformin ingestion exacerbated pathways related to inflammation signaling. Together， this study demonstrated that 2 wk of metformin ingestion induced persistent effects on Old MPCs that improved function in vitro and altered their transcriptional signature including histone and chromatin remodeling.Keywords:aging; diabetes; satellite cells; senescence; skeletal muscle."

Temporal gene expression profiling of maslinic acid-treated Raji cells.,Mol Omics, 2021 Apr 19,33346776,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33346776/,Maslinic acid is a novel phytochemical reported to target multiple signaling pathways. A complete gene expression profile was therefore constructed to illustrate the anti-tumourigenesis effects of maslinic acid in Raji cells across five time-points. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in maslinic acid treated Raji cells at 0， 4， 8， 12， 24 and 48 h. Extracted RNA was hybridized using the AffymetrixGeneChip to obtain expression profiles. A total of 109 genes were found to be significantly expressed over a period of 48 hours. By 12 hours， maslinic acid regulates the majority of genes involved in the cell cycle， p53 and NF-κB signaling pathways. At the same time， XAF1， APAF1， SESN3， and TP53BP2 were evidently up-regulated， while oncogenes， FAIM， CD27， and RRM2B， were down-regulated by at least 2-fold. In conclusion， maslinic acid shows an hourly progression of gene expression in Raji cells.

Glucocorticoid receptor activity discriminates between progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate effects in breast cells.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2012 Jan,21336598,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21336598/,The purpose of this article is to determine the tumorigenic potential of estradiol treatment (E2) when combined with either progesterone (P4) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in normal luminal human breast cells (HBE) and in human breast cancer cells (T47-D， MCF-7). Proliferation profiles were evaluated， along with the gene transactivation activity between the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors (PR， GR) in HBE， T47-D， and MCF-7 cells treated by E2 + P4 or E2 + MPA. High throughput transcriptome analysis was performed on RNA from HBE cells treated by E2， E2 + MPA and E2 + P4. GR content was analyzed in normal breast cells as well. In HBE cells， E2 + P4 treatment was antiproliferative and promoted cellular differentiation. In contrast， E2 + MPA displayed mitogenic， antiapoptotic effects in HBE cells and did not influence cellular differentiation. The effect of P4 and MPA on cell proliferation was， however， variable in breast cancer cells. In cells containing GR or/and PR， MPA decreased proliferation whereas P4 antiproliferative effect needed the presence of PR. In HBE cells， the regulation of genes by E2 + P4， and E2 + MPA was significantly different， particularly in cell proliferation and cell death gene families. Further analysis revealed a modulation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene expression pathway by E2 + MPA. Predominant MPA glucocorticoid activity in normal and breast cancer cells was demonstrated using a glucocorticoid antagonist and the down-regulation of the GR by RNA interference. In normal luminal breast cells and in breast cancer cells， P4 and MPA combined with E2 treatment have opposing mitogenic effects due to GR. The consequences of MPA glucocorticoid potencies as well as the importance of GR in breast tissue merit a reappraisal.

Human glioma cell culture: two FCS-free media could be recommended for clinical use in immunotherapy.,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim, 2009 Oct,19533255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19533255/,Immunotherapy， particularly active vaccination， may be developed as an effective and safe treatment modality for malignant gliomas， which continue to have a poor prognosis， despite advances in surgical techniques and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since no glioma-specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been discovered， autologous tumor cells or well-established glioma cell lines could be used in future vaccination protocols to induce antitumour immunity against unknown TAAs. One obstacle for clinical use of these tumour cell vaccines is related to foetal calf serum (FCS). Efforts are currently being directed toward developing FCS-free media and serum-free alternatives to culture these cell vaccines. In this study， a medium containing human serum and one serum-free medium (UltraCulture)， supplemented or not with epidermal growth factor， were tested on morphology， survival， DNA content and TAA expression of human glioma cell lines and glioma biopsy primary cultures. Their effects were compared on FCS-containing medium. Results show that， whatever the medium used， no significant variations in morphology and survival were observed. Furthermore， human serum-containing medium or UltraCulture preserved at early passage cultures the cell population of interest present in the biopsies before culture. In addition， the expression profile of eight TAAs was similar between these media. These data indicate that human serum-containing medium and UltraCulture serum-free medium could be promising candidates to produce tumour-cell vaccines.
Bayesian Network to Infer Drug-Induced Apoptosis Circuits from Connectivity Map Data.,Methods Mol Biol, 2018,29767372,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29767372/,"The Connectivity Map (CMAP) project profiled human cancer cell lines exposed to a library of anticancer compounds with the goal of connecting cancer with underlying genes and potential treatments. As most targeted anticancer therapeutics aim to induce tumor-selective apoptosis， it is critical to understand the specific cell death pathways triggered by drugs. This can help to better understand the mechanism of how cancer cells respond to chemical stimulations and improve the treatment of human tumors. In this study， using Connectivity MAP microarray-based gene expression data， we applied a Bayesian network modeling approach and identified apoptosis as a major drug-induced cellular pathway. We focused on 13 apoptotic genes that showed significant differential expression across all drug-perturbed samples to reconstruct the apoptosis network. In our predicted subnetwork， 9 out of 15 high-confidence interactions were validated in literature， and our inferred network captured two major cell death pathways by identifying BCL2L11 and PMAIP1 as key interacting players for the intrinsic apoptosis pathway， and TAXBP1 and TNFAIP3 for the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Our inferred apoptosis network also suggested the role of BCL2L11 and TNFAIP3 as ""gateway"" genes in the drug-induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways.Keywords:Apoptosis; Bayesian network; CMAP; Cancer; Drug discovery; Gene expression; Microarray."
Direct comparison of canine and human immune responses using transcriptomic and functional analyses.,Sci Rep, 2024 Jan 26,38272935,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38272935/,The canine spontaneous cancer model is increasingly utilized to evaluate new combined cancer immunotherapy approaches. While the major leukocyte subsets and phenotypes are closely related in dogs and humans， the functionality of T cells and antigen presenting cells in the two species has not been previously compared in detail. Such information would be important in interpreting immune response data and evaluating the potential toxicities of new cancer immunotherapies in dogs. To address this question， we used in vitro assays to compare the transcriptomic， cytokine， and proliferative responses of activated canine and human T cells， and also compared responses in activated macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis following T cell activation revealed shared expression of 515 significantly upregulated genes and 360 significantly downregulated immune genes. Pathway analysis identified 33 immune pathways shared between canine and human activated T cells， along with 34 immune pathways that were unique to each species. Activated human T cells exhibited a marked Th1 bias， whereas canine T cells were transcriptionally less active overall. Despite similar proliferative responses to activation， canine T cells produced significantly less IFN-γ than human T cells. Moreover， canine macrophages were significantly more responsive to activation by IFN-γ than human macrophages， as reflected by co-stimulatory molecule expression and TNF-α production. Thus， these studies revealed overall broad similarity in responses to immune activation between dogs and humans， but also uncovered important key quantitative and qualitative differences， particularly with respect to T cell responses， that should be considered in designing and evaluating cancer immunotherapy studies in dogs.
Mitochondria-Associated Transcriptome Profiling via Localizable Aggregation-Induced Emission Photosensitizers in Live Cells.,ACS Chem Biol, 2024 Feb 16,38264802,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38264802/,In recent decades， there has been increasing interest in studying mitochondria through transcriptomic research. Various exogenous fusion protein-based proximity labeling methods have been reported that focus on the site of one particular protein/peptide and might also influence the corresponding localization or interactome. To enable unbiased and high spatial-resolution profiling of mitochondria-associated transcriptomes in live cells， a flexible RNA proximity labeling approach was developed using aggregation-induced emission (AIE) type photosensitizers (PSs) that possess great mitochondria-targeting capabilities. Their accumulation in an enclosed mitochondrial environment tends to enhance the fluorescence emission and reactive oxygen species generation. By comparing the in vitro optical properties， photosensitization processes， as well as the in cellulo mitochondrial specificity and RNA labeling performance of four AIE PSs， high-throughput sequencing analysis was conducted using TFPy-mediated RNA proximity labeling in live HeLa cells. This approach successfully captured a comprehensive list of transcripts， including mitochondria-encoded RNAs， as well as some nuclear-derived RNAs located at the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacting organelles. This small molecule-based proximity labeling method bypasses complex genetic manipulation and transfection steps， making it readily applicable for diverse research purposes.
Transcriptome analysis uncovers the key pathways and candidate genes related to the treatment of Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces with the repurposed drug pyronaridine.,BMC Genomics, 2021 Jul 13,34256697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34256697/,Background:Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a life-threatening zoonosis caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. Our previous study showed that an approved drug pyronaridine (PND) is highly effective against CE， both in vitro and in an animal model. To identify possible target genes， transcriptome analysis was performed with E. granulosus sensu stricto protoscoleces treated with PND.Results:A total of 1，321 genes were differentially expressed in protoscoleces treated with PND， including 541 upregulated and 780 downregulated genes. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses revealed that the spliceosome， mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were the top three enriched pathways. Western blot analysis showed that PND treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in protein expression levels of EgMKK1 (MKK3/6-like) and EgMKK2 (MEK1/2-like)， two members of MAPK cascades. Interestingly， several heat shock protein (HSP) genes were greatly downregulated including stress-inducible HSPs and their constitutive cognates， and some of them belong to Echinococcus-specific expansion of HSP70.Conclusions:PND has a great impact on the spliceosome， MAPK pathway and ABC transporters， which may underline the mechanisms by which PND kills E. granulosus protoscoleces. In addition， PND downregulates HSPs expression， suggesting a close relationship between the drug and HSPs.Keywords:ABC transporter; Echinococcus granulosus; Heat shock protein; MAPK; Protoscoleces; RNA sequencing; pyronaridine.
Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment.,F1000Res, 2025 May 2,40417623,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40417623/,Background:Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly， several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy， notably， histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as vorinostat and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as zebularine. However， a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity，i.e.， the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable， thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance， treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene， leading to unintended adverse effect.Methods:Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample， we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning.Results:We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at eight doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1µM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available， our model distinguished the post-treatment upversusdownregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore， a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model.Conclusions:Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting.Keywords:Cancer therapy; DNMTi; Epigenetics; HDACi; Machine Learning; Transcriptomics.
Development and validation of a disulfidptosis-related genes signature for predicting outcomes and immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia.,Front Immunol, 2025 Apr 4,40255396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40255396/,Background:Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy with poor outcomes and high recurrence. Disulfidptosis， a novel form of programmed cell death driven by aberrant disulfide bonds and F-actin collapse， provides insights into cancer progression and treatment.Methods:We investigated the correlation network and prognostic values of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in AML. Unsupervised clustering was performed to reveal distinct disulfidptosis-related AML subtypes. We implemented the differential analysis and enrichment analysis to explore the difference of the distinct subtypes in biological processes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox model was used to generate a disulfidptosis-related signature. We employed the ESTIMATE， CIBERSORT， and scRNA analyses to assess the tumor microenvironment of AML. Moreover， experiments validated the functions of PTPN6 and CSK in OCI-AML2 cells.Results:We identified 10 prognostic DRGs and revealed two disulfidptosis subtypes. DRGs significantly affected immune processes like interferon-gamma response and MHC class II antigen presentation. LASSO algorithm was implemented to established a 6-gene signature (HLA-DRB5， CCDC124， PTPN6， HLA-DMA， CSK， ISG15) that predicted prognosis in two validation cohorts more robustly than other signatures. Disulfidptosis was correlated with tumor microenvironment immune cells， especially monocytes. The two risk subgroups differed significantly in susceptibilities of multiple chemotherapy drugs， indicating disulfidptosis as a potential therapeutic target. Knockdown of PTPN6 and CSK inhibited the proliferation of AML cells and increased apoptosis.Conclusions:Our study provides insights into DRG prognoses and immunomodulation， establishing a robust 6-gene risk model for predicting AML outcomes that may enhance precision medicine and treatment strategies.Keywords:acute myeloid leukemia; disulfidptosis-related genes; immunomodulation; prognosis; risk model; tumor microenvironment.
In-channel printing-device opening assay for micropatterning multiple cells and gene analysis.,Anal Chem, 2015 Feb 17,25630902,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25630902/,Herein we report an easy but versatile method for patterning different cells on a single substrate by using a microfluidic approach that allows not only spatial and temporal control of multiple microenvironments but also retrieval of specific treated cells to profile their expressed genetic information at around 10-cell resolution. By taking advantages of increased surface area of gold nanoparticles on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) coated substrate， cell adhesive-promotive protein， human fibronectin (hFN) can be significantly accumulated on designed regions where cells can recognize the protein and spread out. Moreover， the whole device can be easily opened by hand without any loss of patterned cells which could be retrieved by mouth-pipet. Consequently， we demonstrate the possibility of analyzing the difference of gene expression patterns between wild type MCF-7 cell and MCF/Adr (drug-resistant cell line) from less than 400 cells in total for a single comprehensive assay， including parallel experiments， controls， and multiple dose treatments. Certain genes， especially the P-glycoprotein coding gene (ABCB1)， show high expression level in resistant cells compared with the wild type， suggesting a possible pathway that may contribute to the antidrug mechanism.
Thioridazine inhibits gene expression control of the cell wall signaling pathway (CWI) in the human pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.,Mol Genet Genomics, 2016 Jun,26956010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26956010/,Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermodimorphic fungus associated with paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM)， the most common systemic mycosis in Latin America. PCM treatment involves a long-term chemotherapeutic approach and relapses occur at an alarming frequency. Moreover， the emergence of strains with increased drug-resistance phenotypes puts constant pressure on the necessity to develop new alternatives to treat systemic mycoses. In this work， we show that the phenothiazine (PTZ) derivative thioridazine (TR) inhibits in vitro growth of P. brasiliensis yeasts at micromolar concentrations. We employed microarray hybridization to examine how TR affects gene expression in this fungus， identifying ~1800 genes that were modulated in response to this drug. Dataset evaluation showed that TR inhibits the expression of genes that control the onset of the cell wall integrity (CWI) response， hampering production of all major structural polysaccharides of the fungal cell wall (chitin， α-glucan and β-glucan). Although TR and other PTZs have been shown to display antimicrobial activity by various mechanisms， inhibition of CWI signaling has not yet been reported for these drugs. Thus， TR may provide a novel approach to treat fungal infections by targeting cell wall biogenesis.Keywords:Cell wall integrity; Gene expression; Paracoccidioides brasiliensis; Phenothiazine; Thioridazine.
Identification of four key biomarkers and small molecule drugs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,Bioengineered, 2021 Dec,34261404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34261404/,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a heterogeneous carcinoma whose underlying molecular mechanisms involved in tumor initiation， progression， and migration are largely unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify key biomarkers and small-molecule drugs for screening， diagnosing， and treating NPC via gene expression profile analysis. Raw microarray data was used to identify 430 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The key modules associated with histological grade and tumor stage were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. qRT-PCR was used to verify the differential expression of hub genes. Gene ontology (GO)， Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)， and the connectivity map database were used to identify potential mechanisms and screen small-molecule drugs targeting hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis showed that genes in the green module were enriched in the regulation of cell cycle， p53 signaling pathway， and cell part morphogenesis. Four DEG-related hub genes (CRIP1， KITLG， MARK1， andPGAP1) in the green module， which were considered potential diagnostic biomarkers， were taken as the final hub genes. The expression levels of these four hub genes were verified via qRT-PCR， and the results were consistent with findings from the GEO analysis. Screening was also conducted to identify small-molecule drugs with potential therapeutic effects against NPC. In conclusion， four potential prognostic biomarkers and several candidate small-molecule drugs， which may provide new insights for NPC therapy， were identified.Keywords:Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; WGCNA; hub genes; signature; small-molecule drugs.
Integrated systems biology analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: unveiling molecular signatures and drug repurposing opportunities.,Ann Hematol, 2024 Oct,38836918,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38836918/,ute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological malignancy characterized by aberrant proliferation and accumulation of lymphoid precursor cells within the bone marrow. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)， imatinib mesylate， has played a significant role in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph + ALL). However， the achievement of durable and sustained therapeutic success remains a challenge due to the development of TKI resistance during the clinical course.The primary objective of this investigation is to propose a novel and efficacious treatment approach through drug repositioning， targeting ALL and its Ph + subtype by identifying and addressing differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This study involves a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome datasets pertaining to ALL and Ph + ALL in order to identify DEGs associated with the progression of these diseases to identify possible repurposable drugs that target identified hub proteins.The outcomes of this research have unveiled 698 disease-related DEGs for ALL and 100 for Ph + ALL. Furthermore， a subset of drugs， specifically glipizide for Ph + ALL， and maytansine and isoprenaline for ALL， have been identified as potential candidates for therapeutic intervention. Subsequently， cytotoxicity assessments were performed to confirm the in vitro cytotoxic effects of these selected drugs on both ALL and Ph + ALL cell lines.In conclusion， this study offers a promising avenue for the management of ALL and Ph + ALL through drug repurposed drugs. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell death， and clinical trials are recommended to validate the promising results obtained through drug repositioning strategies.Keywords:Acute lymphocytic leukemia; Biomarkers; Drug repositioning; Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Systems biology.
Transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after interaction with human airway epithelial cells.,Infect Immun, 2004 Sep,15322041,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15322041/,The transcriptional profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after interactions with primary normal human airway epithelial cells was determined using Affymetrix GeneChip technology.

DeepTTA: a transformer-based model for predicting cancer drug response.,Brief Bioinform, 2022 May 13,35348595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35348595/,Identifying new lead molecules to treat cancer requires more than a decade of dedicated effort. Before selected drug candidates are used in the clinic， their anti-cancer activity is generally validated by in vitro cellular experiments. Therefore， accurate prediction of cancer drug response is a critical and challenging task for anti-cancer drugs design and precision medicine. With the development of pharmacogenomics， the combination of efficient drug feature extraction methods and omics data has made it possible to use computational models to assist in drug response prediction. In this study， we propose DeepTTA， a novel end-to-end deep learning model that utilizes transformer for drug representation learning and a multilayer neural network for transcriptomic data prediction of the anti-cancer drug responses. Specifically， DeepTTA uses transcriptomic gene expression data and chemical substructures of drugs for drug response prediction. Compared to existing methods， DeepTTA achieved higher performance in terms of root mean square error， Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient on multiple test sets. Moreover， we discovered that anti-cancer drugs bortezomib and dactinomycin provide a potential therapeutic option with multiple clinical indications. With its excellent performance， DeepTTA is expected to be an effective method in cancer drug design.Keywords:IC50; cancer cell line; drug response prediction; gene expression; transcriptome; transformer.
Acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to cisplatin is multifactorial with cell context-dependent involvement of resistance genes.,Cancer Gene Ther, 2016 Dec,27910856,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27910856/,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal of malignancies， in large measure， due to the propensity of PDAC cells to acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. A better understanding of the molecular basis of acquired resistance is a major focus of contemporary PDAC research. We report here the results of a study to independently develop cisplatin resistance in two distinct parental PDAC cell lines， AsPC1 and BxPC3， and to subsequently examine the molecular mechanisms associated with the acquired resistance. Cisplatin resistance in both resistant cell lines was found to be multifactorial and to be associated with mechanisms related to drug transport， drug inactivation， DNA damage response， DNA repair and the modulation of apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that the two resistant cell lines employed alternative molecular strategies in acquiring resistance dictated， in part， by pre-existing molecular differences between the parental cell lines. Collectively， our findings indicate that strategies to inhibit or reverse acquired resistance of PDAC cells to cisplatin， and perhaps other chemotherapeutic agents， may not be generalized but will require individual molecular profiling and analysis to be effective.
First transcriptomic insight into the reprogramming of human macrophages by levan-type fructans.,Carbohydr Polym, 2023 Nov 15,37659791,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37659791/,Based on stimuli in the biological milieu， macrophages can undergo classical activation into the M1 pro-inflammatory (anti-cancer) phenotype or to the alternatively activated M2 anti-inflammatory one. Drug-free biomaterials have emerged as a new therapeutic strategy to modulate macrophage phenotype. Among them， polysaccharides polarize macrophages to M1 or M2 phenotypes based on the surface receptors they bind. Levan， a fructan， has been proposed as a novel biomaterial though its interaction with macrophages has been scarcely explored. In this study， we investigate the interaction of non-hydrolyzed and hydrolyzed Halomonas levan and its sulfated derivative with human macrophages in vitro. Viability studies show that these levans are cell compatible. In addition， RNA-sequencing analysis reveals the upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways. These results are in good agreement with real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction that indicates higher expression levels of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 8 and interleukin-6 genes and the M2-to-M1 reprogramming of these cells upon levan treatment. Finally， cytokine release studies confirm that hydrolyzed levans increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reprogram IL-4-polarized macrophages to the M1 state. Overall findings indicate that Halomonas levans trigger a classical macrophage activation and pave the way for their application in therapeutic interventions requiring a pro-inflammatory phenotype.Keywords:Classical (M1) and alternative (M2) macrophage activation; Fructan; Halomonas levan; Immunotherapy; Macrophage polarization; RNA-seq.
Drug response prediction by ensemble learning and drug-induced gene expression signatures.,Genomics, 2019 Sep,31533900,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31533900/,Chemotherapeutic response of cancer cells to a given compound is one of the most fundamental information one requires to design anti-cancer drugs. Recently， considerable amount of drug-induced gene expression data has become publicly available， in addition to cytotoxicity databases. These large sets of data provided an opportunity to apply machine learning methods to predict drug activity. However， due to the complexity of cancer drug mechanisms， none of the existing methods is perfect. In this paper， we propose a novel ensemble learning method to predict drug response. In addition， we attempt to use the drug screen data together with two novel signatures produced from the drug-induced gene expression profiles of cancer cell lines. Finally， we evaluate predictions by in vitro experiments in addition to the tests on data sets. The predictions of the methods， the signatures and the software are available from http://mtan.etu.edu.tr/drug-response-prediction/.Keywords:Cell line signatures; Drug response prediction; Drug signatures; Ensemble learning.
Identifying clinically relevant drug resistance genes in drug-induced resistant cancer cell lines and post-chemotherapy tissues.,Oncotarget, 2015 Dec 1,26515599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26515599/,Until recently， few molecular signatures of drug resistance identified in drug-induced resistant cancer cell models can be translated into clinical practice. Here， we defined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pre-chemotherapy colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue samples of non-responders and responders for 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin-based therapy as clinically relevant drug resistance genes (CRG5-FU/L-OHP). Taking CRG5-FU/L-OHP as reference， we evaluated the clinical relevance of several types of genes derived from HCT116 CRC cells with resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin， respectively. The results revealed that DEGs between parental and resistant cells， when both were treated with the corresponding drug for a certain time， were significantly consistent with the CRG5-FU/L-OHP as well as the DEGs between the post-chemotherapy CRC specimens of responders and non-responders. This study suggests a novel strategy to extract clinically relevant drug resistance genes from both drug-induced resistant cell models and post-chemotherapy cancer tissue specimens.Keywords:5-fluorouracil; colorectal cancer; drug treatment response; drug-induced resistant cancer cell lines; oxaliplatin.
Multifunctional anti-cancer nano-platforms are moving to clinical trials.,Curr Drug Metab, 2013 Jun,23687926,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23687926/,Cancer management needs rapid， non-invasive diagnosis and tumour-specific therapeutics which is unfortunately lacking for most cancer types. Novel approaches for cancer management aim at providing customized therapy according to individual diagnoses， determined by gene expression profiling， in particular， targeting highly selective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to single cancer cell antigens， in combination with highly cytotoxic drugs， thereby avoiding the unwanted side effects of conventional chemotherapy. Multifunctional nano-vectors that combine new and more powerful drugs and/or probes for diagnostic imaging with tumour surface-specific ligands/antibodies have been developed. These nano-vectors have displayed superior selective anti-tumour activity compared to antibodies or standard anti-cancer drugs/agents alone both in-vitro， and in preclinical and clinical models. Anti-cancer nano-platforms can significantly improve early cancer detection and ameliorate therapeutic strategies. In the immediate future nano-technology may enable the simultaneous early detection and selective inactivation of cancer cells before they develop into full blown tumours.
Screening common signaling pathways associated with drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer via gene expression profile analysis.,Cancer Med, 2019 Jun,31025554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31025554/,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although several therapeutic strategies have been employed to curb lung cancer， the survival rate is still poor owing to the development of drug resistance. The mechanisms underlying drug resistance development are incompletely understood. Here， we aimed to identify the common signaling pathways involved in drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Three published transcriptome microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database comprising different drug-resistant cell lines and their parental cell lines. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and used to perform Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. An overlapping analysis was performed for KEGG pathways enriched from all the three datasets to identify the common signaling pathways. As a result， we found that metabolic pathways， ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis， and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were the most aberrantly expressed signaling pathways. The knockdown of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)， the gene involved in metabolic pathways and known to be upregulated in drug-resistant tumor cells， was shown to increase the apoptosis of cisplatin-resistant A549 cells following cisplatin treatment. Thus， our results provide an in-depth analysis of the signaling pathways that are commonly altered in drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines and highlight the potential strategy that facilitates the development of interventions to interfere with upregulated signaling pathways as well as to boost downregulated signaling pathways in drug-resistant tumors for the elimination of multiple resistance of NSCLC.Keywords:common signaling pathways; drug resistance; non-small cell lung cancer; transcriptome microarray data.
DeepSynergy: predicting anti-cancer drug synergy with Deep Learning.,Bioinformatics, 2018 May 1,29253077,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29253077/,Motivation:While drug combination therapies are a well-established concept in cancer treatment， identifying novel synergistic combinations is challenging due to the size of combinatorial space. However， computational approaches have emerged as a time- and cost-efficient way to prioritize combinations to test， based on recently available large-scale combination screening data. Recently， Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance. However， Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction， which is the approach we present here， termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information， a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity， and conical layers to model drug synergies.Results:DeepSynergy was compared to other machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Machines， Random Forests， Support Vector Machines and Elastic Nets on the largest publicly available synergy dataset with respect to mean squared error. DeepSynergy significantly outperformed the other methods with an improvement of 7.2% over the second best method at the prediction of novel drug combinations within the space of explored drugs and cell lines. At this task， the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the measured and the predicted values of DeepSynergy was 0.73. Applying DeepSynergy for classification of these novel drug combinations resulted in a high predictive performance of an AUC of 0.90. Furthermore， we found that all compared methods exhibit low predictive performance when extrapolating to unexplored drugs or cell lines， which we suggest is due to limitations in the size and diversity of the dataset. We envision that DeepSynergy could be a valuable tool for selecting novel synergistic drug combinations.Availability and implementation:DeepSynergy is available via www.bioinf.jku.at/software/DeepSynergy.Contact:klambauer@bioinf.jku.at.Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Sublethal Radiation Affects Antigen Processing and Presentation Genes to Enhance Immunogenicity of Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2020 Apr 7,32272797,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32272797/,While immunotherapy in cancer is designed to stimulate effector T cell response， tumor-associated antigens have to be presented on malignant cells at a sufficient level for recognition of cancer by T cells. Recent studies suggest that radiotherapy enhances the anti-cancer immune response and also improves the efficacy of immunotherapy. To understand the molecular basis of such observations， we examined the effect of ionizing X-rays on tumor antigens and their presentation in a set of nine human cell lines representing cancers of the esophagus， lung， and head and neck. A single dose of 7.5 or 15 Gy radiation enhanced the New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) tumor-antigen-mediated recognition of cancer cells by NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+T cells. Irradiation led to significant enlargement of live cells after four days， and microscopy and flow cytometry revealed multinucleation and polyploidy in the cells because of dysregulated mitosis， which was also revealed in RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome profiles of cells. Transcriptome analyses also showed that while radiation had no universal effect on genes encoding tumor antigens， it upregulated the expression of numerous genes involved in antigen processing and presentation pathways in all cell lines. This effect may explain the immunostimulatory role of cancer radiotherapy.Keywords:antigen presentation; cancer cell line; gene expression; head and neck cancer; lung cancer; radiation; tumor antigen.
Geraniol suppresses prostate cancer growth through down-regulation of E2F8.,Cancer Med, 2016 Oct,27683099,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27683099/,Geraniol， an acyclic dietary monoterpene， has been found to suppress cancer survival and growth. However， the molecular mechanism underlying the antitumor action of geraniol has not been investigated at the genome-wide level. In this study， we analyzed the microarray data obtained from geraniol-treated prostate cancer cells. Geraniol potently altered a gene expression profile and primarily down-regulated cell cycle-related gene signatures， compared to linalool， another structurally similar monoterpene that induces no apparent phenotypic changes. Master regulator analysis using the prostate cancer-specific regulatory interactome identified that the transcription factor E2F8 as a specific target molecule regulates geraniol-specific cell cycle signatures. Subsequent experiments confirmed that geraniol down-regulated E2F8 expression and the knockdown of E2F8 was sufficient to suppress cell growth by inducing G2/M arrest. Epidemiological analysis showed that E2F8 is up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer and associated with poor prognosis. These results indicate that E2F8 is a crucial transcription regulator controlling cell cycle and survival in prostate cancer cells. Therefore， our study provides insight into the role of E2F8 in prostate cancer biology and therapeutics.Keywords:Bioinformatics; E2F8; cell cycle control; clustering analysis; geraniol; master regulator analysis; prostate cancer.
Tumour microenvironment-based molecular profiling reveals ideal candidates for high-grade serous ovarian cancer immunotherapy.,Cell Prolif, 2021 Mar,33522069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33522069/,Objective:Due to limited immunological profiles of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)， we aimed to characterize its molecular features to determine whether a specific subset that can respond to immunotherapy exists.Materials and methods:A training cohort of 418 HGSOC samples from TCGA was analysed by consensus non-negative matrix factorization. We correlated the expression patterns with the presence of immune cell infiltrates， immune regulatory molecules and other genomic or epigenetic features. Two independent cohorts containing 482 HGSOCs and in vitro experiments were used for validation.Results:We identified immune and non-immune groups where the former was enriched in signatures that reflect immune cells， infiltration and PD-1 signalling (all， P < 0.001)， and presented with a lower chromosomal aberrations but increased neoantigens， tumour mutation burden， and microsatellite instability (all， P < 0.05); this group was further refined into two microenvironment-based subtypes characterized by either immunoactivation or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and distinct prognosis. CAFs-immune subtype was enriched for factors that mediate immunosuppression and promote tumour progression， including highly expressed stromal signature， TGF-β signalling， epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumour-associated M2-polarized macrophages (all， P < 0.001). Robustness of these immune-specific subtypes was verified in validation cohorts， and in vitro experiments indicated that activated-immune subtype may benefit from anti-PD1 antibody therapy (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Our findings revealed two immune subtypes with different responses to immunotherapy and indicated that some HGSOCs may be susceptible to immunotherapies or combination therapies.Keywords:high-grade serous ovarian cancer; immune-specific subtype; immunotherapy response; molecular classification; tumour immune microenvironment.
Chemical castration and anti-androgens induce differential gene expression in prostate cancer.,J Pathol, 2012 Jul,22431170,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22431170/,Endocrine therapy by castration or anti-androgens is the gold standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Although it has been used for decades， the molecular consequences of androgen deprivation are incompletely known and biomarkers of its resistance are lacking. In this study， we studied the molecular mechanisms of hormonal therapy by comparing the effect of bicalutamide (anti-androgen)， goserelin (GnRH agonist) and no therapy， followed by radical prostatectomy. For this purpose， 28 men were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Freshly frozen specimens were used for gene expression profiling for all known protein-coding genes. An in silico Bayesian modelling tool was used to assess cancer-specific gene expression from heterogeneous tissue specimens. The expression of 128 genes was > two-fold reduced by the treatments. Only 16% of the altered genes were common in both treatment groups. Of the 128 genes， only 24 were directly androgen-regulated genes， according to re-analysis of previous data on gene expression， androgen receptor-binding sites and histone modifications in prostate cancer cell line models. The tumours containing TMPRSS2-ERG fusion showed higher gene expression of genes related to proliferation compared to the fusion-negative tumours in untreated cases. Interestingly， endocrine therapy reduced the expression of one-half of these genes and thus diminished the differences between the fusion-positive and -negative samples. This study reports the significantly different effects of an anti-androgen and a GnRH agonist on gene expression in prostate cancer cells. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion seems to bring many proliferation-related genes under androgen regulation.
Development and characterization of an in vitro model of colorectal adenocarcinoma with MDR phenotype.,Cancer Med, 2016 Jun,27016279,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27016279/,The major cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR)， and the characterization of biological factors involved in this response to therapy is particularly needed. A doxorubicin-resistant HCT-8/R clone was selected from sensitive parental cells and characterized analyzing several parameters (cell cycle phase distribution， apoptotic activity， expression， distribution and functionality of the P-gp efflux pump， the response to other chemotherapy agents， its ultrastructural features， invasiveness， and transcriptomic profile). HCT-8/R cells showed a peculiar S phase distribution， characterized by a single pulse of proliferation， resistance to drug-mediated apoptosis， increased expression and functionality of P-gp and overexpression of stem cell markers (CD44 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A2). At the ultrastructural level， HCT-8/R presented a greater cell volume and several intracytoplasmic vesicles respect to HCT-8. Moreover， the resistant clone was characterized by cross resistance to other cytotoxic drugs and a greater capacity for migration and invasion， compared to parental cells. Our data reinforce the concept that the MDR phenotype in HCT-8/R cells is multifactorial and involves multiple mechanisms， representing an interesting tool to understand the biological basis of MDR and to test strategies that overcome resistance to chemotherapy.Keywords:Colorectal cancer; multi drug resistance; trascriptomics.
A comprehensive landscape analysis of autophagy in cancer development and drug resistance.,Front Immunol, 2024 Aug 26,39253092,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39253092/,"Background:Autophagy plays important roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance， and the autophagy underlying the tumor pathogenesis and further mechanisms of chemoresistance emergence remains unknown.Methods:In this study， via the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method， an autophagy 45-gene list was identified to evaluate samples' autophagy activity， verified through six GEO datasets with a confirmed autophagy phenotype. It was further utilized to distinguish tumors into autophagy score-high and score-low subtypes， and analyze their transcriptome landscapes， including survival analysis， correlation analysis of autophagy- and resistance-related genes， biological functional enrichment， and immune- and hypoxia-related and genomic heterogeneity comparison， in TCGA pan-cancer datasets. Furthermore， we performed an analysis of autophagy status in breast cancer chemoresistance combined with multiple GEO datasets andin vitroexperiments to validate the mechanisms of potential anticancer drugs for reversing chemoresistance， including CCK-8 cell viability assays， RT-qPCR， and immunofluorescence.Results:The 45-gene list was used to identify autophagy score-high and score-low subtypes and further analyze their multi-dimensional features. We demonstrated that cancer autophagy status correlated with significantly different prognoses， molecular alterations， biological process activations， immunocyte infiltrations， hypoxia statuses， and specific mutational processes. The autophagy score-low subtype displayed a more favorable prognosis compared with the score-high subtype， associated with their immune-activated features， manifested as high immunocyte infiltration， including high CD8+T， Tfh， Treg， NK cells， and tumor-associated macrophages M1/M2. The autophagy score-low subtype also showed a high hypoxia score， and hypoxic tumors showed a significantly differential prognosis in different autophagy statuses. Therefore， ""double-edged"" cell fates triggered by autophagy might be closely correlated with the immune microenvironment and hypoxia induction. Results demonstrated that dysregulated autophagy was involved in many cancers and their therapeutic resistance and that the autophagy was induced by the resistance-reversing drug response， in five breast cancer GEO datasets and validated byin vitroexperiments.In vitro， dihydroartemisinin and artesunate could reverse breast cancer doxorubicin resistance， through inducing autophagy via upregulating LC3B and ATG7.Conclusion:Our study provided a comprehensive landscape of the autophagy-related molecular and tumor microenvironment patterns for cancer progression and resistance， and highlighted the promising potential of drug-induced autophagy in the activation of drug sensitivity and reversal of resistance.Keywords:breast cancer; doxorubicin resistance; immune microenvironment; pan-cancer; tumor resistance."
Transcriptome Profiling of Cardiac Glycoside Treatment Reveals EGR1 and Downstream Proteins of MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway in Human Breast Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2023 Nov 2,37958905,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37958905/,Cardiac glycosides (CGs) constitute a group of steroid-like compounds renowned for their effectiveness in treating cardiovascular ailments. In recent times， there has been growing recognition of their potential use as drug leads in cancer treatment. In our prior research， we identified three highly promising CG compounds， namely lanatoside C (LC)， peruvoside (PS)， and strophanthidin (STR)， which exhibited significant antitumor effects in lung， liver， and breast cancer cell lines. In this study， we investigated the therapeutic response of these CGs， with a particular focus on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We conducted transcriptomic profiling and further validated the gene and protein expression changes induced by treatment through qRT-PCR， immunoblotting， and immunocytochemical analysis. Additionally， we demonstrated the interactions between the ligands and target proteins using the molecular docking approach. The transcriptome analysis revealed a cluster of genes with potential therapeutic targets involved in cytotoxicity， immunomodulation， and tumor-suppressor pathways. Subsequently， we focused on cross-validating the ten most significantly expressed genes，EGR1，MAPK1，p53，CCNK，CASP9，BCL2L1，CDK7，CDK2，CDK2AP1， andCDKN1A， through qRT-PCR， and their by confirming the consistent expression pattern with RNA-Seq data. Notably， among the most variable genes， we identified EGR1， the downstream effector of the MAPK signaling pathway， which performs the regulatory function in cell proliferation， tumor invasion， and immune regulation. Furthermore， we substantiated the influence of CG compounds on translational processes， resulting in an alteration in protein expression upon treatment. An additional analysis of ligand-protein interactions provided further evidence of the robust binding affinity between LC， PS， and STR and their respective protein targets. These findings underscore the intense anticancer activity of the investigated CGs， shedding light on potential target genes and elucidating the probable mechanism of action of CGs in breast cancer.Keywords:RNA-Seq analysis; anticancer activity; breast cancer; immunoregulation; lanatoside C; peruvoside; strophanthidin.
Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Anti-Cancer Effects of Isorhapontigenin (ISO) on Highly Invasive Human T24 Bladder Cancer Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2024 Feb 1,38339062,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38339062/,Bladder cancer， the most common malignancy of the urinary tract， has a poor overall survival rate when the tumor becomes muscle invasive. The discovery and evaluation of new alternative medications targeting high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are of tremendous importance in reducing bladder cancer mortality. Isorhapontigenin (ISO)， a stilbene derivative from the Chinese herbGnetum cleistostachyum， exhibits a strong anti-cancer effect on MIBCs. Here， we report the whole transcriptome profiling of ISO-treated human bladder cancer T24 cells. A total of 1047 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified， including 596 downregulated and 451 upregulated genes. Functional annotation and pathway analysis revealed that ISO treatment induced massive changes in gene expression associated with cell movement， migration， invasion， metabolism， proliferation， and angiogenesis. Additionally， ISO treatment-activated genes involved in the inflammatory response but repressed genes involved in hypoxia signaling， glycolysis， the actin cytoskeleton， and the tumor microenvironment. In summary， our whole transcriptome analysis demonstrated a shift in metabolism and altered actin cytoskeleton in ISO-treated T24 cells， which subsequently contribute to tumor microenvironment remodeling that suppresses tumor growth and progression.Keywords:actin cytoskeleton; bladder cancer; metabolic reprogramming; tumor microenvironment; whole transcriptome analysis.

TNF-α Differentially Regulates Cell Cycle Genes in Promyelocytic and Granulocytic HL-60/S4 Cells.,G3 (Bethesda), 2019 Aug 8,31263060,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31263060/,Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a potent cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and immune modulation. Signaling responses that involve TNF-α are context dependent and capable of stimulating pathways promoting both cell death and survival. TNF-α treatment has been investigated as part of a combined therapy for acute myeloid leukemia due to its modifying effects on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediated differentiation into granulocytes. To investigate the interaction between cellular differentiation and TNF-α， we performed RNA-sequencing on two forms of the human HL-60/S4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line treated with TNF-α. The ATRA-differentiated granulocytic form of HL-60/S4 cells had an enhanced transcriptional response to TNF-α treatment compared to the undifferentiated promyelocytes. The observed TNF-α responses included differential expression of cell cycle gene sets， which were generally upregulated in TNF-α treated promyelocytes， and downregulated in TNF-α treated granulocytes. This is consistent with TNF-α induced cell cycle repression in granulocytes and cell cycle progression in promyelocytes. Moreover， we found evidence that TNF-α treatment of granulocytes shifts the transcriptome toward that of a macrophage. We conclude that TNF-α treatment promotes a divergent transcriptional program in promyelocytes and granulocytes. TNF-α promotes cell cycle associated gene expression in promyelocytes. In contrast， TNF-α stimulated granulocytes have reduced cell cycle gene expression， and a macrophage-like transcriptional program.Keywords:Cell cycle; Cytokine; Differentiation; Gene regulation; Leukemia.

Computational Drug Repositioning for Gastric Cancer using Reversal Gene Expression Profiles.,Sci Rep, 2019 Feb 25,30804389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30804389/,Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) often produces poor outcomes. Moreover， predicting which GC treatments will be effective remains challenging. Computational drug repositioning using public databases is a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. Here we used a computational reversal of gene expression approach based on effects on gene expression signatures by GC disease and drugs to explore new GC drug candidates. Gene expression profiles for individual GC tumoral and normal gastric tissue samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were determined with a meta-signature analysis. Profiles drug activity and drug-induced gene expression were downloaded from the ChEMBL and the LINCS databases， respectively. Candidate drugs to treat GC were predicted using reversal gene expression score (RGES). Drug candidates including sorafenib， olaparib， elesclomol， tanespimycin， selumetinib， and ponatinib were predicted to be active for treatment of GC. Meanwhile， GC-related genes such as PLOD3， COL4A1， UBE2C， MIF， and PRPF5 were identified as having gene expression profiles that can be reversed by drugs. These findings support the use of a computational reversal gene expression approach to identify new drug candidates that can be used to treat GC.

A modular approach for integrative analysis of large-scale gene-expression and drug-response data.,Nat Biotechnol, 2008 May,18464786,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18464786/,High-throughput technologies are now used to generate more than one type of data from the same biological samples. To properly integrate such data， we propose using co-modules， which describe coherent patterns across paired data sets， and conceive several modular methods for their identification. We first test these methods using in silico data， demonstrating that the integrative scheme of our Ping-Pong Algorithm uncovers drug-gene associations more accurately when considering noisy or complex data. Second， we provide an extensive comparative study using the gene-expression and drug-response data from the NCI-60 cell lines. Using information from the DrugBank and the Connectivity Map databases we show that the Ping-Pong Algorithm predicts drug-gene associations significantly better than other methods. Co-modules provide insights into possible mechanisms of action for a wide range of drugs and suggest new targets for therapy.
Identification of novel genes involved in the synergistic antitumor effect of caffeine in osteosarcoma cells using cDNA macroarray.,Anticancer Res, 2008 Mar-Apr,18507003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18507003/,Background:Caffeine enhances the cytocidal effects of DNA-damaging agents. This study investigated genes involved in the synergistic effect of caffeine on osteosarcoma cells using gene-profiling analysis.Materials and methods:Sensitivity to cisplatin and the synergistic effect of caffeine were evaluated in five osteosarcoma cell lines with different p53 gene status. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using cDNA macroarray and verified by real-time RT-PCR.Results:The cell lines were grouped into three types with different cytotoxic patterns. Comparison of profiling data from these groups identified twelve novel genes associated with the synergistic effect of caffeine. Real-time RT-PCR analyses verified up-regulation of two apoptosis-enhancing genes and down-regulation of two interferon-inducible genes related to the synergy of caffeine.Conclusion:These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the synergistic effect of caffeine related to p53 gene status in osteosarcoma， providing candidates for an assay of responsiveness to caffeine-potentiated chemotherapy for osteosarcoma.
Molecular basis of targeted therapy in T/NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia: A comprehensive genomic and immunohistochemical analysis of a panel of 33 cell lines.,PLoS One, 2017 May 15,28505169,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28505169/,T and NK-cell lymphoma is a collection of aggressive disorders with unfavorable outcome， in which targeted treatments are still at a preliminary phase. To gain deeper insights into the deregulated mechanisms promoting this disease， we searched a panel of 31 representative T-cell and 2 NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines for predictive markers of response to targeted therapy. To this end， targeted sequencing was performed alongside the expression of specific biomarkers corresponding to potentially activated survival pathways. The study identified TP53， NOTCH1 and DNMT3A as the most frequently mutated genes. We also found common alterations in JAK/STAT and epigenetic pathways. Immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear accumulation of MYC (in 85% of the cases)， NFKB (62%)， p-STAT (44%) and p-MAPK (30%). This panel of cell lines captures the complexity of T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative processes samples， with the partial exception of AITL cases. Integrated mutational and immunohistochemical analysis shows that mutational changes cannot fully explain the activation of key survival pathways and the resulting phenotypes. The combined integration of mutational/expression changes forms a useful tool with which new compounds may be assayed.
miR-29b， miR-205 and miR-221 enhance chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in HuH28 human cholangiocarcinoma cells.,PLoS One, 2013 Oct 17,24147037,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24147037/,Background and aims:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is highly resistant to chemotherapy， including gemcitabine (Gem) treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous， non-coding， short RNAs that can regulate multiple genes expression. Some miRNAs play important roles in the chemosensitivity of tumors. Here， we examined the relationship between miRNA expression and the sensitivity of CCA cells to Gem.Methods:Microarray analysis was used to determine the miRNA expression profiles of two CCA cell lines， HuH28 and HuCCT1. To determine the effect of candidate miRNAs on Gem sensitivity， expression of each candidate miRNA was modified via either transfection of a miRNA mimic or transfection of an anti-oligonucleotide. Ontology-based programs were used to identify potential target genes of candidate miRNAs that were confirmed to affect the Gem sensitivity of CCA cells.Results:HuCCT1 cells were more sensitive to Gem than were HuH28 cells， and 18 miRNAs were differentially expressed whose ratios over ± 2log2 between HuH28 and HuCCT1. Among these 18 miRNAs， ectopic overexpression of each of three downregulated miRNAs in HuH28 (miR-29b， miR-205， miR-221) restored Gem sensitivity to HuH28. Suppression of one upregulated miRNA in HuH28， miR-125a-5p， inhibited HuH28 cell proliferation independently to Gem treatment. Selective siRNA-mediated downregulation of either of two software-predicted targets， PIK3R1 (target of miR-29b and miR-221) or MMP-2 (target of miR-29b)， also conferred Gem sensitivity to HuH28.Conclusions:miRNA expression profiling was used to identify key miRNAs that regulate Gem sensitivity in CCA cells， and software that predicts miRNA targets was used to identify promising target genes for anti-tumor therapies.
Comparative Expression Profiling Reveals Molecular Markers Involved in the Progression of Cutaneous Melanoma towards Metastasis.,Int J Mol Sci, 2023 Mar 31,37047539,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047539/,Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer and often proves fatal in metastatic stages. Few treatment options are available， and its global incidence is quickly increasing. In order to gain an improved understanding of the molecular features regarding melanoma progression， we have compared gene and small non-coding RNA expression profiles from cell lines derived from primary melanoma (MelJuSo)， lymph node metastasis (MNT-1) and brain metastasis (VMM1)， representing distinct stages of malignant progression. Our preliminary results highlighted the aberrant regulation of molecular markers involved in several processes that aid melanoma progression and metastasis development， including extracellular matrix remodeling， migratory potential and angiogenesis. Moreover， bioinformatic analysis revealed potential targets of the microRNAs of interest. Confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry analysis were used for validation at the protein level. Exploring the molecular landscape of melanoma may contribute to the achievement of future efficient targeted therapy， as well as better prevention， diagnosis and clinical management.Keywords:EGFR; FFPE samples; IL1B; MAGEC1; MMP2; brain metastasis; cutaneous melanoma; lymph node metastasis; microRNAs.
Extracellular vesicles from triple-negative breast cancer cells promote proliferation and drug resistance in non-tumorigenic breast cells.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2018 Dec,30173296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30173296/,Purpose:Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)， an aggressive breast cancer subtype， is genetically heterogeneous which challenges the identification of clinically effective molecular makers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular signaling communication and have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role and mechanisms of EVs derived from TNBC cells in modulating proliferation and cytotoxicity to chemotherapeutic agents in non-tumorigenic breast cells (MCF10A).Methods:EVs were isolated from TNBC cell lines and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis， Western blot， and transmission electron microscopy. MCF10A cells were treated with the isolated EVs and evaluated for cell proliferation and cytotoxicity to Docetaxel and Doxorubicin by the MTT and MTS assays， respectively. Gene and miRNA expression profiling was performed in the treated cells to determine expression changes that may be caused by EVs treatment.Results:MCF10A cells treated with HCC1806-EVs (MCF10A/HCC1806-EVs) showed a significant increase in cell proliferation and resistance to the therapeutic agents tested. No significant effects were observed in the MCF10A cells treated with EVs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. Gene and miRNA expression profiling revealed 138 genes and 70 miRNAs significantly differentially expressed among the MCF10A/HCC1806-EVs and the untreated MCF10A cells， affecting mostly the PI3K/AKT， MAPK， and HIF1A pathways.Conclusion:EVs isolated from the HCC1806 TNBC cells are capable of inducing proliferation and drug resistance on the non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast cells， potentially mediated by changes in genes and miRNAs expression associated with cell proliferation， apoptosis， invasion， and migration.Keywords:Drug resistance; Exosomes; Gene expression; Proliferation; TNBC; miRNA expression.
Association of transcriptional levels of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism-related genes in cancer cell lines with drug treatment response.,Cancer Genet, 2019 Sep,31447063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31447063/,Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is essential for growth and survival of cancer cells. We investigated whether the response of cancer cells to antitumor treatment may be partially influenced by variation in expression of one-carbon metabolism genes. We used cancer cell line information from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer resources to examine whether variation in pretreatment expression of one-carbon metabolism-related genes was associated with response to treatment. GART， TYMS， SHMT2， MTR， ALDH2， BHMT， MAT2B， MTHFD2， NNMT， and SLC46A1 showed modest statistically significant correlations with response to a variety of antitumor agents. Higher expression levels of SLC46A1 were associated with resistance to multiple agents， whereas elevated expression of GART， TYMS， SHMT2， MTR， BHMT， and MAT2B was associated with chemosensitivity to multiple drugs. NNMT expression was bimodally distributed and showed different directions of association with various agents. Correlation of increased NNMT expression with sensitivity to dasatinib was validated in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel. Pretreatment expression levels were correlated among many one-carbon metabolism genes. Expression of several folate genes was strongly associated with expression of multiple components of drug target pathways. Molecular mechanisms underlying associations of one-carbon metabolism gene with drug response require further investigation.Keywords:Cancer treatment; Drug sensitivity; Folate; Gene expression; One-carbon metabolism.
Characterization of type I interferon pathway during hepatic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells and hepatitis C virus infection.,Stem Cell Res, 2015 Sep,26313525,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26313525/,Pluripotent stem cells are being actively studied as a cell source for regenerating damaged liver. For long-term survival of engrafting cells in the body， not only do the cells have to execute liver-specific function but also withstand the physical strains and invading pathogens. The cellular innate immune system orchestrated by the interferon (IFN) pathway provides the first line of defense against pathogens. The objective of this study is to assess the innate immune function as well as to systematically profile the IFN-induced genes during hepatic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. To address this objective， we derived endodermal cells (day 5 post-differentiation)， hepatoblast (day 15) and hepatocyte-like cells (day 21) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Day 5， 15 and 21 cells were stimulated with IFN-α and subjected to IFN pathway analysis. Transcriptome analysis was carried out by RNA sequencing. The results showed that the IFN-α treatment activated STAT-JAK pathway in differentiating cells. Transcriptome analysis indicated stage specific expression of classical and non-classical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Subsequent validation confirmed the expression of novel ISGs including RASGRP3， CLMP and TRANK1 by differentiated hepatic cells upon IFN treatment. Hepatitis C virus replication in hESC-derived hepatic cells induced the expression of ISGs--LAMP3， ETV7， RASGRP3， and TRANK1. The hESC-derived hepatic cells contain intact innate system and can recognize invading pathogens. Besides assessing the tissue-specific functions for cell therapy applications， it may also be important to test the innate immune function of engrafting cells to ensure adequate defense against infections and improve graft survival.Keywords:Differentiation; Endoderm; Hepatocyte-like cells; Hepatocytes; ISG; Innate immunity; Interferon; Interferon-stimulated genes; Pluripotent stem cells.
Multiplex analysis of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family and caspase 3 activation by microbead arrays.,Assay Drug Dev Technol, 2014 Apr,24735445,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24735445/,We have developed a multiplex assay to measure the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and caspase 3 activation using the Luminex platform. In this report， we show three applications for this assay. First， we used this assay to identify biomarkers for BCL2 inhibitors to obtain a quantitative measure of expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL2， BCLxL， and MCL1) in a panel of cell lines and correlated their response to BCL2/BCLxL inhibitor， ABT-263 (navitoclax). Second， we used this assay to monitor the change of MCL1 protein expression and induction of active caspase 3 after treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol. Finally， we used this assay to screen for small molecules that decrease MCL1 protein and identified new combinations with ABT-263. This method provides a quick and convenient way to measure basal expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins and monitor expression change upon drug treatment. It is also applicable for high-throughput screening for compounds that decrease the expression of these anti-apoptotic proteins.
Prediction of toxicant-specific gene expression signatures after chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cell lines.,Environ Health Perspect, 2004 Nov,15598611,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15598611/,Global gene expression profiling has demonstrated that the predominant cellular response to a range of toxicants is a general stress response. This stereotyped environmental stress response commonly includes repression of protein synthesis and cell-cycle-regulated genes and induction of DNA damage and oxidative stress-responsive genes. Our laboratory recently characterized the general stress response of breast cell lines derived from basal-like and luminal epithelium after treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) or 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and showed that each cell type has a distinct response. However， we expected that some of the expression changes induced by DOX and 5FU would be unique to each compound and might reflect the underlying mechanisms of action of these agents. Therefore， we employed supervised analyses (significance analysis of microarrays) to identify genes that showed differential expression between DOX-treated and 5FU-treated cell lines. We then used cross-validation analyses and identified genes that afforded high predictive accuracy in classifying samples into the two treatment classes. To test whether these gene lists had good predictive accuracy in an independent data set， we treated our panel of cell lines with etoposide， a compound mechanistically similar to DOX. We demonstrated that using expression patterns of 100 genes we were able to obtain 100% predictive accuracy in classifying the etoposide samples as being more similar in expression to DOX-treated than to 5FU-treated samples. These analyses also showed that toxicant-specific gene expression patterns， similar to general stress responses， vary according to cell type.
Endothelial transcriptomic changes induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein disclose an up-regulation of Jak-Stat pathway.,Vascul Pharmacol, 2015 Oct,26028607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26028607/,Oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) act as an etiological factor in the development of atherosclerosis by modifying the biological properties of endothelial cells through mechanisms of vascular inflammation. To deepen the oxLDL changes at cellular level， a transcriptomic analysis of human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs) treated with oxLDL was performed to identify the modified signaling pathways. Total RNA was isolated from HUAECs treated with oxLDL (100 μg/ml). Gene expression analysis was carried out using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Biological pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Microarray assay demonstrated that oxLDL strongly affected two metabolic and signaling transduction pathways: the biosynthesis of steroids， via modification of nine genes that act sequentially in this metabolic pathway， and the Jak-Stat signaling pathway acting through STAT1 and STAT2. By means of qPCR， immunoblot， RNA interference and inhibitors we demonstrate that the mechanism used by oxLDL to activate Jak-Stat signaling pathway in artery endothelial cells is mainly mediated by STAT1. These findings provide a new mechanistic framework to better understand the effects that oxLDLs exert in artery endothelial cell gene expression and provide a source of hypothesis to understand the involvement of oxLDL in diseases in which endothelial cells play a key role， such as atherosclerosis.Keywords:Atherosclerosis; Cell signaling; Endothelial cells; Gene expression; Oxidized low density lipoproteins.
Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression profiles in response to treatment with tomato leaf extract in mcf-7 breast cancer cells.,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2012,23464452,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23464452/,We previously found cytotoxic effects of tomato leaf extract (TLE) on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The aim of this study was to ascertain the molecular mechanisms associated with the usage of TLE as an anticancer agent by microarray analysis using mRNA from MCF-7 breast cancer cells after treatment with TLE for 1 hr and 48 hrs. Approximately 991 genes out of the 30，000 genes in the human genome were significantly (p<0.05) changed after the treatment. Within this gene set， 88 were significantly changed between the TLE treated cells and the untreated MCF-7 cells (control cells) with a cut-off fold change >2.00. In order to focus on genes that were involved in cancer cell growth， only twenty-nine genes were selected， either down-regulated or up-regulated after treatment with TLE. Microarray assay results were confirmed by analyzing 10 of the most up and down regulated genes related to cancer cells progression using real-time PCR. Treatment with TLE induced significant up-regulation in the expression of the CRYAB， PIM1， BTG1， CYR61， HIF1-α and CEBP-β genes after 1 hr and 48 hrs， whereas the TXNIP and THBS1 genes were up-regulated after 1 hr of treatment but down-regulated after 48 hrs. In addition both the HMG1L1 and HIST2H3D genes were down-regulated after 1 hr and 48 hrs of treatment. These results demonstrate the potent activity of TLE as an anticancer agent.
Expression profiles of subtracted mRNAs during cellular senescence in human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow.,Exp Gerontol, 2013 May,23466301,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23466301/,Cellular senescence is an irreversible cell cycle arrest that limits the replicative lifespan of cells. Senescence suppresses development of tumors by regulating aging factors， such as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) and telomerase. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between young human mesenchymal stem cells (Y-hMSCs) and senescent human mesenchymal stem cells (S-hMSCs). We selected positive clones that were functionally characterized by referring to public databases using NCBI BLAST tool. This search revealed that 19 genes were downregulated， and 43 genes were upregulated in S-hMSCs relative to Y-hMSCs. Among subtracted clones in Y-hMSCs， most of genes markedly were related to metabolic functions. These genes， PDIA3， WDR1， FSTL1， COPG1， LMAN1， and PDIA6， significantly downregulated. Conversely， genes for subtracted clones in S-hMSCs were mostly associated with cell adhesion. In particular， the expression levels of 9 genes， HSP90B1， EID1， ATP2B4， DDAH1， PRNP， RAB1A， PGS5， TM4SF1 and SSR3， gradually increased during senescence. These genes have not previously been identified as being related to cellular senescence， but they seemed to be potentially affected during cellular senescence.
Cytotoxicity Assessment and Apoptosis-related Gene Profiling of Antibody Treated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) Cancerous Cell Lines.,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol, 2019 Oct 30,32245312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32245312/,ute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) are common acute leukemia in adults and children， respectively. In these malignancies， chemotherapy is the main treatment strategy that fails in many cases and is usually associated with adverse effects on healthy cells. In this regard， the development of new therapies is essential. Monoclonal antibodies directed to the cell surface markers of leukemic blasts may have promising consequences with minimal toxic effects on normal cells. Since cluster of differentiation 45Ra (CD45Ra) and CD123 antigens， two considered surface markers of leukemic blasts in AML and ALL respectively， are overexpressed on AML and ALL blasts， CD34+ leukemic progenitors， and AML-LSCs in comparison with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)， they were selected to be targeted; using specific monoclonal antibodies. In this project， CD45Ra+ cells and CD123+ cells were targeted by anti-CD45Ra and/or anti-CD123 monoclonal antibodies. Cytotoxicity effect and cell death induction was determined by 3-(4，5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Changes in the expression profile of MCL1， cMyc， Survivin， Id1， and PIM1 genes were assessed by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis of the results showed effective antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis in KG1α (CD45Ra+) and Nalm6 (CD123+) cell lines. Also， a significant change in the expression level of some of the apoptosis-related genes was observed. According to the results of this study， it can be concluded that an effective targeting of AML and ALL cancerous cell lines can be performed by anti-CD45Ra and anti-CD123 monoclonal antibodies through their effector functions and apoptosis induction.Keywords:Acute leukemia cell lines; Apoptotic genes; Cytotoxicity assessment; Immunotherapy.
Mining functional relationships in feature subspaces from gene expression profiles and drug activity profiles.,FEBS Lett, 2002 Apr 10,11959115,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11959115/,In an effort to determine putative functional relationships between gene expression patterns and drug activity patterns of 60 human cancer cell lines， a novel method was developed to discover local associations within cell line subsets. The association of drug-gene pairs is an explorative way of discovering gene markers that predict clinical tumor sensitivity to therapy. Nine drug-gene networks were discovered， as well as dozens of gene-gene and drug-drug networks. Three drug-gene networks with well studied members were discussed and the literature shows that hypothetical functional relationships exist. Therefore， this method enables the gathering of new information beyond global associations.
Pharmacogenomics of Cameroonian traditional herbal medicine for cancer therapy.,J Ethnopharmacol, 2011 Sep 1,21763411,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21763411/,Ethnopharmacological relevance:A socio-economic burden associated with cancers is reported in Africa. Ethnopharmacological usages such as immune and skin disorders， inflammatory， and others chould be considered when selecting plants used to treat cancer， since these reflect disease states bearing relevance to cancer or a cancer symptoms.Materials and methods:Documented compounds of Cameroonian medicinal plants were used as keywords in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database to establish a library of cytotoxic compounds. Cellular and pharmacogenomic profiling was then performed for the 10 most cytotoxic natural products. By COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses， candidate genes were identified whose mRNA expression significantly predicted sensitivity or resistance of cell lines to the two most cytotoxic compounds.Results:Up to 974 compounds isolated from 148 medicinal plants were used as keywords in the NCI database to establish a library of 27 cytotoxic compounds. Two of the 10 most cytotoxic compounds， plumericin from Plumeria rubra and plumbagin from Diospyros crassiflora and Diospyros canaliculata， were analyzed in more detail. The IC(50) values for plumericin and plumbagin of 60 NCI cell lines were associated with the microarray-based transcriptome-wide mRNA expression. Genes products identified for plumericin activity are mainly involved in enzymatic activity， transcriptional processes or are structural constituents of ribosomes. Products identified for plumbagin activity are involved in several processes， but they are mostly the strucrural constituents of ribosomes or involved in enzymatic activity.Conclusions:The most significant progress of the present investigation， the first of its kind ever reported for investigated natural product in Sub-Saharan Africa， was the connection between traditionally used medicinal plants and the mechanistic analysis， such as pharmacogenomics.
Characterization of the interaction between human respiratory syncytial virus and the cell cycle in continuous cell culture and primary human airway epithelial cells.,J Virol, 2011 Oct,21795354,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21795354/,Viruses can modify conditions inside cells to make them more favorable for replication and progeny virus production. One way of doing this is through manipulation of the cell cycle， a process that describes the ordered growth and division of cells. Analysis of model cell lines， such as A549 cells and primary airway epithelial cells， infected with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) has shown alteration of the cell cycle during infection， although the signaling events were not clearly understood. In this study， targeted transcriptomic analysis of HRSV-infected primary airway epithelial cells revealed alterations in the abundances of many mRNAs encoding cell cycle-regulatory molecules， including decreases in the D-type cyclins and corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6 [CDK4/6]). These alterations were reflected in changes in protein abundance and/or relocalization in HRSV-infected cells; taken together， they were predicted to result in G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. In contrast， there was no change in the abundances of D-type cyclins in A549 cells infected with HRSV. However， the abundance of the G(1)/S phase progression inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) was increased over that in mock-treated cells， and this， again， was predicted to result in G(0)/G(1) phase arrest. The G(0)/G(1) phase arrest in both HRSV-infected primary cells and A549 cells was confirmed using dual-label flow cytometry that accurately measured the different stages of the cell cycle. Comparison of progeny virus production in primary and A549 cells enriched in G(0)/G(1) using a specific CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor with asynchronously replicating cells indicated that this phase of the cell cycle was more efficient for virus production.
Cytological Assessments and Transcriptome Profiling Demonstrate that Evodiamine Inhibits Growth and Induces Apoptosis in a Renal Carcinoma Cell Line.,Sci Rep, 2017 Oct 3,28974748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28974748/,Chinese medicines are an important source of secondary metabolites with excellent antitumour activity. Evodia rutaecarpa， from the family Rutaceae， exhibits antitumour activity. Evodiamine (EVO)， which was isolated from the fruit of E. rutaecarpa， exhibits robust antitumour activity. However， the antitumour mechanism of EVO remains unclear. In this study， we assessed the growth-inhibiting effect of EVO on two renal carcinoma cell lines. We found that EVO could change the morphology and decrease the viability and proliferation of cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in vitro. In addition， transcriptome analysis indicated that EVO can modulate the transcriptome of Caki-1 cells. In total， 7，243 differentially expressed genes were found， among which 3，347 downregulated genes and 3，896 upregulated genes were mainly involved in cell migration， apoptosis， cell cycle， and DNA replication. Furthermore， we demonstrated that EVO can cause apoptosis， arrest cells in the G2/M phase， and regulate the expression of apoptosis- and cell cycle-related genes in Caki-1 cells. Our study reveals the anticancer effects of EVO using cellular and molecular data， and indicates the potential uses of this compound as a resource to characterize the antitumour mechanisms of E. rutaecarpa.
Genomic profiling of long non-coding RNA and mRNA expression associated with acquired temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells.,Int J Oncol, 2017 Aug,28714520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28714520/,Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent widely used in anti-glioma treatment. However， acquired TMZ resistance represents a major clinical challenge that leads to tumor relapse or progress. This study investigated the genomic profiles including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression associated with acquired TMZ resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) cells in vitro. The TMZ-resistant (TR) of GBM sub-cell lines were established through repetitive exposure to increasing TMZ concentrations in vitro. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between the parental U87 and U87TR cells were detected by human lncRNA microarray method. In this study， we identified 2，692 distinct lncRNAs demonstrating >2-fold differential expression with 1，383 lncRNAs upregulated and 1，309 lncRNAs downregulated. Moreover， 4，886 differential mRNAs displayed 2，933 mRNAs upregulated and 1，953 mRNAs downregulated. Further lncRNA classification and subgroup analysis revealed the potential functions of the lncRNA-mRNA relationship associated with the acquired TMZ resistance. Gene ontology and pathway analysis on mRNAs showed significant biological regulatory genes and pathways involved in acquired TMZ resistance. Moreover， we found the ECM‑receptor interaction pathway was significantly downregulated and ECM related collagen Ι， fibronectin， laminin and CD44 were closely associated with the TR phenotype in vitro. Our findings indicate that the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs identified in this work may provide novel targets for overcoming acquired TMZ resistance in GBM chemotherapy.
Investigating critical genes and gene interaction networks that mediate cyclophosphamide sensitivity in chronic myelogenous leukemia.,Mol Med Rep, 2017 Jul,28560425,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28560425/,Drug resistance is an obstacle in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)， and is a common reason for treatment failure or disease progression. However， the underlying mechanisms of cyclophosphamide resistance remain poorly defined. In the present study， microarray data concerning cyclophosphamide‑sensitive and ‑resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines were analyzed. A total of 258 differentially‑expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between these two groups， from which 139 DEGs were upregulated and 119 were downregulated. Several candidate genes that were associated with cyclophosphamide resistance were also identified. These DEGs were subsequently classified using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment pathway analysis. A total of 487 biological processes and 17 KEGG pathways were revealed to be enriched. Furthermore， an interaction network was established to identify the core genes that regulated cyclophosphamide resistance. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A)， FYN proto‑oncogene， Src family tyrosine kinase and spleen associated tyrosine kinase were revealed to be the hub genes in multiple enriched biological processes and signaling pathways， indicating that these were involved in mediating cyclophosphamide sensitivity in CML cells. The expression levels of 5 DEGs were also confirmed in two human CML cell lines (K‑562 and KU812) by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore， selective knockdown of STAT5A and S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4) recovered cyclophosphamide sensitivity in K‑562 cells， suggesting their involvement in drug resistance. The present study identified several potential genes and pathways contributing to cyclophosphamide resistance， and confirmed the involvement of STAT5A and S100A4 in drug resistance. These results enable improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in CML cells.
Vitamin D Treatment Sequence Is Critical for Transcriptome Modulation of Immune Challenged Primary Human Cells.,Front Immunol, 2021 Dec 10,34956186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956186/,Microbe-associated molecular patterns， such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and β-glucan (BG)， are surrogates of immune challenges like bacterial and fungal infections， respectively. The biologically active form of vitamin D， 1α，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1，25(OH)2D3)， supports the immune system in its fight against infections. This study investigated significant and prominent changes of the transcriptome of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that immediately after isolation are exposed to 1，25(OH)2D3-modulated immune challenges over a time frame of 24-48 h. In thisin vitrostudy design， most LPS and BG responsive genes are downregulated and their counts are drastically reduced when cells are treated 24 h after， 24 h before or in parallel with 1，25(OH)2D3. Interestingly， only a 1，25(OH)2D3pre-treatment of the LPS challenge results in a majority of upregulated genes. Based on transcriptome-wide data both immune challenges display characteristic differences in responsive genes and their associated pathways， to which the actions of 1，25(OH)2D3often oppose. The joined BG/1，25(OH)2D3response is less sensitive to treatment sequence than that of LPS/1，25(OH)2D3. In conclusion， the functional consequences of immune challenges are significantly modulated by 1，25(OH)2D3but largely depend on treatment sequence. This may suggest that a sufficient vitamin D status before an infection is more important than vitamin D supplementation afterwards.Keywords:PBMCs; immune challenge; infection; lipopolysaccharide; responsive genes; transcriptome; vitamin D; β-glucan.
Molecular dissection of a medicinal herb with anti-tumor activity by oligonucleotide microarray.,Life Sci, 2005 Jul 15,15964315,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15964315/,It is difficult to understand precisely the physiological actions of herbs because they contain a complex array of constituent molecules. In the present study we used DNA microarray data for 12600 genes to examine the anti-proliferative activity of the herb Coptidis rhizoma and eight constituent molecules against eight human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We identified 27 genes showing strong correlation with the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) of C. rhizoma after 72-h exposure. Hierarchical cluster analysis with correlation coefficients between expression levels of these 27 C. rhizoma-related genes and the ID50 of each constituent molecule classified these test molecules into two clusters， one consisting of C. rhizoma and berberine and the other consisting of the remaining seven molecules. Our results suggest that one molecule， berberine， can account for the majority of the anti-proliferative activity of C. rhizoma and that DNA microarray analyses can be used to improve our understanding of the actions of an intact herb.
Risuteganib Protects against Hydroquinone-induced Injury in Human RPE Cells.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 2020 Aug 3,32818234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32818234/,Purpose:Cigarette smoking has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. Integrin dysfunctions have been associated with AMD. Herein， we investigate the effect of risuteganib (RSG)， an integrin regulator， on RPE cell injury induced by hydroquinone (HQ)， an important oxidant in cigarette smoke.Methods:Cultured human RPE cells were treated with HQ in the presence or absence of RSG. Cell death， mitochondrial respiration， reactive oxygen species production， and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry， XFe24 analyzer， and fluorescence plate reader， respectively. Whole transcriptome analysis and gene expression were analyzed by Illumina RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR， respectively. F-actin aggregation was visualized with phalloidin. Levels of heme oxygenase-1， P38， and heat shock protein 27 proteins were measured by Western blot.Results:HQ induced necrosis and apoptosis， decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics， increased reactive oxygen species levels， decreased mitochondrial membrane potential， increased F-actin aggregates， and induced phosphorylation of P38 and heat shock protein 27. HQ， but not RSG alone， induced substantial transcriptome changes that were regulated by RSG cotreatment. RSG cotreatment significantly protected against HQ-induced necrosis and apoptosis， prevented HQ-reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics， decreased HQ-induced reactive oxygen species production， improved HQ-disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential， reduced F-actin aggregates， decreased phosphorylation of P38 and heat shock protein 27， and further upregulated HQ-induced heme oxygenase-1 protein levels.Conclusions:RSG has no detectable adverse effects on healthy RPE cells， whereas RSG cotreatment protects against HQ-induced injury， mitochondrial dysfunction， and actin reorganization， suggesting a potential role for RSG therapy to treat retinal diseases such as AMD.
Proprietary Herbal Extract Downregulates the Gene Expression of IL-1alpha in HaCaT Cells: Possible Implications Against Nonscarring Alopecia.,Med Arch, 2018 Apr,30302033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30302033/,"Background:Currently while， topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are the only medications approved in androgenetic alopecia (AGA)， the cause oriented treatment and immunsupressive treatment are being performed in telogen effluvium (TE) and alopecia areata (AA) respectively. Considering the inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of these three nonscarring alopecia forms， we have formulated a mixture for topical usage composed of six different herbal extracts (HE) which have already known antiinflammatory and antioxidant features.Materials and methods:In addition to performing the phytochemical analysis of HE， we detected the gene expression level of IL-1α， the crucial hair loss mediator， for the putative efficacy in nonscarring alopecia. Cell proliferation assay was performed by XTT reagent. After determination of non-cytotoxic concentration， HaCaT cells were treated with HE. RNA isolations were carried out from both non-treated and treated cell groups by using TRI-reagent. Gene expressions of IL-1α and as control GAPDH were determined by RT-qPCR analysis.Results:Results were represented as ""IL-1α/GAPDH Fold Change"". HE solution caused statistically significant downregulation of IL-1α gene expressions (p<0.0001)， compared to untreated control cells. HE treatment ended up with 0.1900 fold change for IL-1α.Conclusion:IL-1α is a direct growth inhibitory agent in hair follicles and an important actor in the pathogenesis of AGA ， TE， and AA. Considering together the vitamins， flavonoids， and trace elements identified in the phytochemical analyses and downregulation of IL-1α in HaCaT cells， our HE may be an auxiliary agent in the therapy of these three nonscarring alopecia forms.Keywords:alopecia; cosmeceuticals; herbal; topical."
The feasibility of using the compound kushen injection to treat cervical cancer based on network pharmacology and transcriptomics.,Medicine (Baltimore), 2023 Sep 8,37682145,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37682145/,Background:To investigate the molecular targets and mechanisms of compound kushen injection (CKI) in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer based on network pharmacology and transcriptomics.Methods:In this study， we used network pharmacology methods to screen for effective compounds， integrated the results of network pharmacology and RNA-seq to comprehensively screen and predict target genes， analyze the biological functions and signaling pathways of target genes， and construct a PPI network to screen for hub genes. The results were further verified by biological experiments， molecular docking， RT-PCR， and western blot analysis.Results:The results showed that the hub genes CXCL2， anti-vascular endothelial growth factor， hexokinase 2 are therapeutic targets of CKI for the treatment of Cervical Cancer. These targets were significantly enriched in pathways mainly including pathways in cancer， cell cycle， MAPK signaling pathways， etc. In vitro cell experiments showed that CKI could effectively inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells， promote apoptosis， and induce cell cycle arrest. RT-PCR and western blot experiments showed that the expression of hub genes was significantly decreased. The compounds have good binding activity to hub genes.Conclusion:CKI， based on its active ingredients and through multiple targets and multiple pathways， can stop the growth of cervical cancer cells at a certain phase of the cell cycle and cause apoptosis， which proved CKI's effect in treating cervical cancer.
Molecular portrait of cisplatin induced response in human testis cancer cell lines based on gene expression profiles.,Mol Cancer, 2007 Aug 21,17711579,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17711579/,Background:Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) respond well to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and show a low incidence of acquired resistance compared to most somatic tumors. The reasons for these specific characteristics are not known in detail but seem to be multifactorial. We have studied gene expression profiles of testicular and colon cancer derived cell lines treated with cisplatin. The main goal of this study was to identify novel gene expression profiles with their functional categories and the biochemical pathways that are associated with TGCT cells' response to cisplatin.Results:Genes that were differentially expressed between the TGCT cell lines vs the (somatic) HCT116 cell line， after cisplatin treatment， were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method. The response of TGCT cells was strikingly different from that of HCT116， and we identified 1794 genes that were differentially expressed. Functional classification of these genes showed that they participate in a variety of different and widely distributed functional categories and biochemical pathways. Database mining showed significant association of genes (n = 41) induced by cisplatin in our study， and genes previously reported to by expressed in differentiated TGCT cells. We identified 37 p53-responsive genes that were altered after cisplatin exposure. We also identified 40 target genes for two microRNAs， hsa-mir-372 and 373 that may interfere with p53 signaling in TGCTs. The tumor suppressor genes NEO1 and LATS2， and the estrogen receptor gene ESR1， all have binding sites for p53 and hsa-mir-372/373. NEO1 and LATS2 were down-regulated in TGCT cells following cisplatin exposure， while ESR1 was up-regulated in TGCT cells. Cisplatin-induced genes associated with terminal growth arrest through senescence were identified， indicating associations which were not previously described for TGCT cells.Conclusion:By linking our gene expression data to publicly available databases and literature， we provide a global pattern of cisplatin induced cellular response that is specific for testicular cancer cell lines. We have identified cisplatin-responsive functional classes and pathways， such as the angiogenesis， Wnt， integrin， and cadherin signaling pathways. The identification of differentially expressed genes in this study may contribute to a better understanding of the unusual sensitivity of TGCT to some DNA-damaging agents.

Differential regulation of the pro-inflammatory biomarker， YKL-40/CHI3L1， by PTEN/Phosphoinositide 3-kinase and JAK2/STAT3 pathways in glioblastoma.,Cancer Lett, 2018 Aug 10,29729901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29729901/,Constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway is frequently observed in high-grade gliomas with high frequency of losing PTEN tumor suppressor. To identify transcriptomic profiles associated with a hyperactivated PI3K pathway， RNA-sequencing analysis was performed in a glioblastoma cell line stably expressing PTEN. RNA-sequencing revealed enriched transcripts of pro-inflammatory mediators， and among the genes that displayed high differential expression was the secreted glycoprotein YKL-40. Treatment with chemical inhibitors that target the PI3K/AKT pathway elicited differential effects on YKL-40 expression in selected GBM cell lines， indicating that its expression displayed tumor cell-specific variations. This variability appeared to be correlated with the ability to transactivate the immune signaling molecules JAK2 and STAT3. In summary， the differential expression of the immunomodulatory molecule YKL-40 may affect the treatment efficacy of PI3K/AKT-based pathway inhibitors in glioblastoma.Keywords:JAK2/STAT3; PI3K; PTEN; Transcriptomes; YKL-40.

Transcriptome analysis of dominant-negative Brd4 mutants identifies Brd4-specific target genes of small molecule inhibitor JQ1.,Sci Rep, 2017 May 10,28490802,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490802/,The bromodomain protein Brd4 is an epigenetic reader and plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of leukemia. Brd4 binds to acetylated histone tails and activates transcription by recruiting the positive elongation factor P-TEFb. Small molecule inhibitor JQ1 competitively binds the bromodomains of Brd4 and displaces the protein from acetylated histones. However， it remains unclear whether genes targeted by JQ1 are mainly regulated by Brd4 or by other bromodomain proteins such as Brd2 and Brd3. Here， we describe anti-proliferative dominant-negative Brd4 mutants that compete with the function of distinct Brd4 domains. We used these Brd4 mutants to compare the Brd4-specific transcriptome with the transcriptome of JQ1-treated cells. We found that most JQ1-regulated genes are also regulated by dominant-negative Brd4 mutants， including the mutant that competes with the P-TEFb recruitment function of Brd4. Importantly， JQ1 and dominant-negative Brd4 mutants regulated the same set of target genes of c-Myc， a key regulator of the JQ1 response in leukemia cells. Our results suggest that Brd4 mediates most of the anti-cancer effects of JQ1 and that the major function of Brd4 in this process is the recruitment of P-TEFb. In summary， our studies define the molecular targets of JQ1 in more detail.

New and Old Genes Associated with Primary and Established Responses to Paclitaxel Treatment in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines.,Molecules, 2018 Apr 12,29649113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29649113/,Development of drug resistance is the main reason for low chemotherapy effectiveness in treating ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel (PAC) is a chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of this cancer. We analysed the development of PAC resistance in two ovarian cancer cell lines. Exposure of drug-sensitive cell lines (A2780 and W1) to PAC was used to determine the primary response. An established response was determined in PAC-resistant sublines of the A2780 and W1 cell lines. qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression levels of specific genes. We observed decreased expression of thePCDH9，NSBP1， MCTP1andSEMA3Agenes in the PAC-resistant cell lines. Short-term exposure to PAC led to increased expression of theMDR1andBCRPgenes in the A2780 and W1 cell lines. In the A2780 cell line， we also observed increased expression of theC4orf18gene and decreased expression of thePCDH9andSEMA3Agenes after PAC treatment. In the W1 cell line， short-term treatment with PAC upregulated the expression of theALDH1A1gene， a marker of Cancer stem cells (CSCs). Our results suggest that downregulation of thePCDH9，NSBP1，MCTP1andSEMA3Agenes and upregulation of theMDR1， BCRP， C4orf18andALDH1A1genes may be related to PAC resistance.Keywords:new genes; ovarian cancer; paclitaxel resistance.

Detection of drug transporter expression using a 25-multiplex RT-PCR assay.,Biotechnol Lett, 2009 Oct,19495564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19495564/,Membrane transporters play important roles in mediating chemoresistance and chemosensitivity of tumor cells. Five sets of 5 genes were designed to simultaneously detect drug transporter expression in a single reaction tube using multiplex RT-PCR for 25 genes， including 17 ABC transporters， one non-ABC transporter， 4 SLC transporters， 2 copper transporters and one housekeeping gene. We optimized the multiplex RT-PCR conditions using chemosensitive cancer cells and then validated the system using chemoresistant cancer cells. This reliable multiplex RT-PCR assay can be utilized not only to investigate anticancer drug-resistance mechanisms but also to estimate the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapy in the clinic.
Profiling and Characterization of microRNAs Responding to Sodium Butyrate Treatment in Gastric Cancer Cells.,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen, 2022,34711158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34711158/,Background:Short-chain fatty acids exert anti-cancer effects on tumor cells.Objective:We aimed to reveal the signaling network altered by butyrate in Gastric Cancer (GC) using small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq).Methods:The effects of butyrate on the biological behavior of NCI-N87 and KATO III cells in vitro were assessed by functional assays and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of butyrate in KATO III cells were calculated. sRNA-seq was performed on KATO III cells. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified between butyrate treatment and control groups using DESeq2， and miRNA targets were predicted. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DE-miRNA targets was created using Metascape. Key MCODE complexes were identified using the MCODE algorithm and cluster Profiler. The relationship between DE-miRNA and GC overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:Butyrate dose-dependently inhibited NCI-N87 and KATO III cell viability. KATO III cells were more sensitive to butyrate than NCI-N87 cells. Butyrate promoted apoptosis and inhibited KATO III cell migration. Total 324 DE-miRNAs were identified in KATO III cells， and 459 mRNAs were predicted as targets of 83 DE-miRNAs. Two key protein complexes were identified in a PPI network of the 459 targets. A key signaling network responding to butyrate was generated using targets in these key complexes and their miRNA regulators. The DE-miRNAs in the key signaling network were related to the OS of GC.Conclusion:Butyrate altered the biological behavior of GC cells， which may be achieved by regulating miRNAs and related oncogenic pathways.Keywords:Gastric cancer; microRNA; oncogenic signaling; sequencing; small RNA; sodium butyrate treatment.
VLX1570 induces apoptosis through the generation of ROS and induction of ER stress on leukemia cell lines.,Cancer Sci, 2021 Aug,34032336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34032336/," novel proteasome deubiquitinase inhibitor， VLX1570， has been highlighted as a promising therapeutic agent mainly for lymphoid neoplasms and solid tumors. We examined in vitro effects of VLX1570 on eight myeloid and three lymphoid leukemia cell lines. From cell culture studies， 10 out of 11 cell lines except K562 were found to be susceptible to VLX1570 treatment and it inhibited cell growth mainly by apoptosis. Next， to identify the signaling pathways associated with apoptosis， we performed gene expression profiling using HL-60 with or without 50 nmol/L of VLX1570 for 3 hours and demonstrated that VLX1570 induced the genetic pathway involved in ""heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) activation""， ""HSF1 dependent transactivation""， and ""Regulation of HSF1 mediated heat shock response"". VLX1570 increased the amount of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated proteins and the expression of HSP70 as the result of the suppression of ubiquitin proteasome system， the expression of heme oxygenase-1， and the amount of phosphorylation in JNK and p38 associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced apoptosis and the amount of phosphorylation in eIF2α， inducing the expression of ATF4 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress dependent apoptosis protein， CHOP， and the amount of phosphorylation slightly in IRE1α， leading to increased expression of XBP-1s in leukemia cell lines. In the present study， we demonstrate that VLX1570 induces apoptosis and exerts a potential anti-leukemic effect through the generation of ROS and induction of ER stress in leukemia cell lines.Keywords:VLX1570; acute myeloid leukemia; endoplasmic reticulum stress; proteasome deubiquitinase; reactive oxygen species."
Growth inhibition and transcriptional effects of ribavirin in lymphoma.,Oncol Rep, 2019 Sep,31322273,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31322273/,Ribavirin exhibits inhibitory effects on the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)， which participates in lymphomagenesis. Additionally， preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the anti‑lymphoma activity of this drug. To further investigate the potential of ribavirin as an anticancer treatment for lymphoma， the tumor‑suppressive effects of ribavirin were analyzed in lymphoma cell lines. The effects of ribavirin on the viability and clonogenicity of the B‑cell lymphoma cell line Pfeiffer (EZH2‑mutant)， Toledo (EZH2 wild‑type) and cutaneous T‑cell lymphoma Hut78 cell line were assessed. Expression of EZH2 and trimethylation status of histone 3， lysine 27 trimethylated (H3K27m3) was also determined in response to ribavirin. The transcriptional effects of ribavirin on Hut78 cells were analyzed by microarray expression and the results were validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction， western blotting and knockout of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). The results of the present study demonstrated that ribavirin suppressed the growth and clonogenicity of cells in a dose‑dependent manner. Ribavirin did not affect the expression of EZH2 nor altered its activity as evaluated by H3K27 trimethylation status. Furthermore， the results of transcriptome analysis indicated that the majority of the canonical pathways affected by ribavirin were associated with the immune system， including 'antigen presentation'， 'communication between innate and adaptive immune cells' and 'cross‑talk between dendritic and natural killer cells'. The results of gene expression analysis were confirmed， by demonstrating at the RNA and protein levels， downregulation of stearoyl‑CoA desaturase and upregulation of STAT1. Depletion of STAT1， which was proposed as a key regulator of the aforementioned pathways， exerted growth inhibitory effects almost to the same extent as ribavirin. In conclusion， ribavirin was proposed to exert growth inhibitory effects on lymphoma cell lines， particularly Hut78 cells， a cutaneous T‑cell lymphoma cell line. Of note， these effects may depend on， at least in part， the activation of canonical immune pathways regulated by the key factors STAT1 and interferon‑γ. Our results provide insight into the anti‑lymphoma potential of ribavirin; however， further investigations in preclinical and clinical studies are required to determine the effectiveness of ribavirin as a therapeutic agent for treating lymphoma.
Investigation of HMN-176 anticancer activity in human tumor specimens in vitro and the effects of HMN-176 on differential gene expression.,Invest New Drugs, 2005 Jan,15528975,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15528975/,HMN-176， (E)-4-(2-[2-(N-[4-methoxybenzene-sulfonyl]amino)phenyl]ethenyl) pyridine 1-oxide， is a stilbene derivative which inhibits mitosis without significant effect on tubulin polymerization and displays potent cytotoxicity against a variety of human tumor cell lines. The present study evaluated the activity profile of the antineoplastic agent HMN-176 in an ex-vivo soft agar cloning assay (human tumor colony-forming assay) in a panel of 132 human tumor specimens under 14-day continuous exposure at 0.1， 1.0， and 10.0 microg/ml. Thirty percent of specimens in the different treatment groups (39/132 in 0.1 and 1.0 test groups; 40/132 in 10.0 test group) were assessable， falling within the negative and positive control parameters. At these dose levels， responses were observed in 32% (11/34)， 62% (21/34)， and 71% (25/35) of assessable specimens， respectively. HMN-176 demonstrated activity towards 75% of the breast cancer specimens (6/8) treated with 1.0 microg/ml， 67% of non small-cell lung (4/6) and 57% of ovarian (4/7) cancer specimens treated with 10 microg/ml. Low levels of cross-resistance to cisplatin， cyclophosphamide， 5-fluorouracil， and etoposide were also observed. There was a positive relationship between HMN-176 concentration and effect， demonstrating greatest overall activity at 10.0 microg/ml. Evaluation of differential gene expression in drug-sensitive (A2780) and drug-resistant (A2780cp) ovarian carcinoma cell lines exposed to 0.1 microg/ml HMN-176 up to 48 h using cDNA microarrays with 1，154 known human genes revealed significant drug effects on tumor associated genes， including upregulation of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases gene (TIMP) in both cell lines， suggesting that HMN-176 could potentially overcome tumor drug resistance. In conclusion， in vitro responses demonstrate efficacy at pharmacologically relevant concentrations， which suggests that HMN-176 deserves further evaluation in clinical trials.
Therapeutically activating RB: reestablishing cell cycle control in endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer.,Endocr Relat Cancer, 2011 Apr 28,21367843,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21367843/,The majority of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers are treated with endocrine therapy. While this is effective， acquired resistance to therapies targeted against ER is a major clinical challenge. Here， model systems of ER-positive breast cancers with differential susceptibility to endocrine therapy were employed to define common nodes for new therapeutic interventions. These analyses revealed that cell cycle progression is effectively uncoupled from the activity and functional state of ER in these models. In this context， cyclin D1 expression and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) phosphorylation are maintained even with efficient ablation of ER with pure antagonists. These therapy-resistant models recapitulate a key feature of deregulated RB/E2F transcriptional control. Correspondingly， a gene expression signature of RB-dysfunction is associated with luminal B breast cancer， which exhibits a relatively poor response to endocrine therapy. These collective findings suggest that suppression of cyclin D-supported kinase activity and restoration of RB-mediated transcriptional repression could represent a viable therapeutic option in tumors that fail to respond to hormone-based therapies. Consistent with this hypothesis， a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor， PD-0332991， was effective at suppressing the proliferation of all hormone refractory models analyzed. Importantly， PD-0332991 led to a stable cell cycle arrest that was fundamentally distinct from those elicited by ER antagonists， and was capable of inducing aspects of cellular senescence in hormone therapy refractory cell populations. These findings underscore the clinical utility of downstream cytostatic therapies in treating tumors that have experienced failure of endocrine therapy.
Molecular characterization of glycation-associated skin ageing: an alternative skin model to study in vitro antiglycation activity of topical cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical formulations.,Br J Dermatol, 2017 Jan,27363533,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27363533/,Background:Glycation is a nonenzymatic reaction that cross-links a sugar molecule and protein macromolecule to form advanced glycation products (AGEs) that are associated with various age-related disorders; thus glycation plays an important role in skin chronological ageing.Objectives:To develop a novel in vitro skin glycation model as a screening tool for topical formulations with antiglycation properties and to further characterize， at the molecular level， the glycation stress-driven skin ageing mechanism.Methods:The glycation model was developed using human reconstituted full-thickness skin; the presence of Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) was used as evidence of the degree of glycation. Topical application of emulsion containing a well-known antiglycation compound (aminoguanidine) was used to verify the sensitivity and robustness of the model. Cytokine immunoassay， quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and histological analysis were further implemented to characterize the molecular mechanisms of skin ageing in the skin glycation model.Results:Transcriptomic and cytokine profiling analyses in the skin glycation model demonstrated multiple biological changes， including extracellular matrix catabolism， skin barrier function impairment， oxidative stress and subsequently the inflammatory response. Darkness and yellowness of skin tone observed in the in vitro skin glycation model correlated well with the degree of glycation stress.Conclusions:The newly developed skin glycation model in this study has provided a new technological dimension in screening antiglycation properties of topical pharmaceutical or cosmeceutical formulations. This study concomitantly provides insights into skin ageing mechanisms driven by glycation stress， which could be useful in formulating skin antiageing therapy in future studies.
Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor over-expressing cancer cells by the aphorphine-type isoquinoline alkaloid， dicentrine.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2010 Apr 15,20005213,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20005213/,The extraordinary relevance of EGFR in tumour biology makes it an exquisite molecular target for tumour therapy. Despite considerable success with these EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy， resistance against these chemical compounds develops owing to the selection of point-mutated variants of EGFR. Therefore， there is an urgent need for the identification of novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for treating tumours with such EGFR mutants. We found a preferential cytotoxicity of dicentrine towards U87MG.DeltaEGFR-transduced with a constitutively deletion-activated EGFR expression vector as compared to non-transduced wild-type U87MG cells. As determined by microarray-based mRNA expression profiling， this preferential cytotoxicity was accompanied with an activation of BRCA1-mediated DNA damage response， p53 signalling， G1/S and G2/M cell cycle regulation， and aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathways. The activation of these signalling routes might be explained by the fact that dicentrine intercalates DNA and induces DNA strand break by inhibition of DNA topoisomerases. The cell cycle might be arrested by dicentrine-induced DNA lesions.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains exhibit differential and strain-specific molecular signatures in pulmonary epithelial cells.,Dev Comp Immunol, 2016 Dec,27497873,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27497873/,lthough pulmonary epithelial cells are integral to innate and adaptive immune responses during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection， global transcriptomic changes in these cells remain largely unknown. Changes in gene expression induced in pulmonary epithelial cells infected with M. tuberculosis F15/LAM4/KZN， F11， F28， Beijing and Unique genotypes were investigated by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform generated 50 bp reads that were mapped to the human genome (Hg19) using Tophat (2.0.10). Differential gene expression induced by the different strains in infected relative to the uninfected cells was quantified and compared using Cufflinks (2.1.0) and MeV (4.0.9)， respectively. Gene expression varied among the strains with the total number of genes as follows: F15/LAM4/KZN (1187)， Beijing (1252)， F11 (1639)， F28 (870)， Unique (886) and H37Rv (1179). A subset of 292 genes was commonly induced by all strains， where 52 genes were down-regulated while 240 genes were up-regulated. Differentially expressed genes were compared among the strains and the number of induced strain-specific gene signatures were as follows: F15/LAM4/KZN (138)， Beijing (52)， F11 (255)， F28 (55)， Unique (186) and H37Rv (125). Strain-specific molecular gene signatures associated with functional pathways were observed only for the Unique and H37Rv strains while certain biological functions may be associated with other strain signatures. This study demonstrated that strains of M. tuberculosis induce differential gene expression and strain-specific molecular signatures in pulmonary epithelial cells. Specific signatures induced by clinical strains of M. tuberculosis can be further explored for novel host-associated biomarkers and adjunctive immunotherapies.Keywords:Differential gene expression; Molecular signatures; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pulmonary epithelial cells; Transcriptomics.
SHOC2 scaffold protein modulates daunorubicin-induced cell death through p53 modulation in lymphoid leukemia cells.,Sci Rep, 2020 Sep 16,32938995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938995/,SHOC2 scaffold protein has been mainly related to oncogenic ERK signaling through the RAS-SHOC2-PP1 phosphatase complex. In leukemic cells however， SHOC2 upregulation has been previously related to an increased 5-year event-free survival of pediatric pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia， suggesting that SHOC2 could be a potential prognostic marker. To address such paradoxical function， our study investigated how SHOC2 impact leukemic cells drug response. Our transcriptome analysis has shown that SHOC2 can modulate the DNA-damage mediated by p53. Notably， upon genetic inhibition of SHOC2 we observed a significant impairment of p53 expression， which in turn， leads to the blockage of key apoptotic molecules. To confirm the specificity of DNA-damage related modulation， several anti-leukemic drugs has been tested and we did confirm that the proposed mechanism impairs cell death upon daunorubicin-induced DNA damage of human lymphoid cells. In conclusion， our study uncovers new insights into SHOC2 function and reveals that this scaffold protein may be essential to activate a novel mechanism of p53-induced cell death in pre-B lymphoid cells.
Gene expression variations in microsatellite stable and unstable colon cancer cells.,J Surg Res, 2012 May 1,21816436,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21816436/,Background:Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a marker of chemoresistance， but it is associated with improved survival compared with microsatellite-stable (MSS) colon cancers. We hypothesized that MSI tumors overexpress chemoresistance-associated genes and underexpress DNA damage/repair genes. We used ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to assess the expression of representative genes in MSI and MSS colon cancer cell lines.Methods:Solexa UHTS was used to examine gene expression in HCT116 (MSI) and HT29 (MSS) cells， and normal colonic mucosa (NCM). We compared expression of 40 genes involved in chemoresistance， DNA repair， DNA damage， and drug metabolism pathways.Results:We observed gene expression differences between MSI and MSS cell lines in 8 out of 40 genes involved in mismatch repair (MMR)， DNA repair， drug metabolism， and chemoresistance. MMR gene expression was lower in MSI cells， which is consistent with the MSI phenotype， whereas DNA repair genes were highly expressed in these cells. Genes associated with chemoresistance and drug metabolism also had increased expression in MSI cells. No difference in expression of DNA damage genes was observed between MSI and MSS cell lines.Conclusion:Using UHTS gene expression analysis， we identified differential expression of genes between MSI and MSS cell lines which may account for resistance to chemotherapy in MSI tumors. UHTS expression analysis has the potential to identify genome-wide predictors of response or resistance to chemotherapy.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.govNCT00335816.
Expression of multidrug resistance proteins and accumulation of cisplatin in human non-small cell lung cancer cells.,Biol Pharm Bull, 2005 Apr,15802814,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15802814/,In order to understand and overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)， mRNA and protein expression levels of P-glycoprotein (MDR1)， multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1)， and lung resistance-related protein (LRP) were investigated and compared with the chemosensitivity and the intracellular/intranuclear cisplatin accumulation of three NSCLC cell lines (Ma-10， Ma-31， and Ma-46). Ma-31 was more resistant than Ma-10 and Ma-46 to cisplatin， carboplatin， etoposide， and paclitaxel. The mRNA level of MDR1 was extremely low， and MDR1 protein was not detected in all cell lines. MRP1 mRNA expression was highest in Ma-31 and lowest in Ma-10， but there was no notable difference between the MRP1 protein expression in three cell lines. LRP mRNA/protein was equally expressed in Ma-10 and Ma-31， but was nominal in Ma-46. The intracellular/intranuclear cisplatin accumulation of the cells was determined to be Ma-31>Ma-46>Ma-10. Thus， MDR1， MRP1， and LRP mRNA and protein expression levels were not correlated with the chemosensitivity or the intracellular/intranuclear cisplatin accumulation of each cell line. The present results indicate that MDR proteins (MDR1， MRP1， and LRP) may not play an important role in the chemoresistance and drug efflux of NSCLC cells.
Chemosensitivity of human pancreatic carcinoma cells is enhanced by IkappaBalpha super-repressor.,Cancer Sci, 2003 May,12824895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12824895/,Pancreatic cancer has an unfavorable prognosis; surgery and chemotherapy at present have only limited value. To improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer， effective non-surgical therapy is necessary. NF-kappaB is reported to be related to resistance to apoptosis， but its role in chemosensitivity remains controversial. We examined the effects on chemosensitivity of inhibition by induction of the super-repressor IkappaBalpha in pancreatic cancer cell lines， BxPC-3， Capan-1 and Panc-1. IkappaBalpha protein was transduced by infection of adenovirus vector AxCAhIkBDeltaN. Sensitivity to VP-16 and doxorubicin was increased significantly by IkappaBalpha induction in all three pancreatic cell lines. To investigate molecular events during IkappaBalpha induction， we examined the changes in expression of drug-resistance-related genes by real-time RT-PCR and those in apoptosis-related genes by cDNA microarray. There was no common change of gene expression before and after IkappaBalpha induction among the three pancreatic cancer cell lines， except for mdm2. Further examination of other genes is necessary for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of enhancement of chemosensitivity through IkappaBalpha induction. However， we have confirmed that IkappaBalpha induction leads to an increase of chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer. Many problems remain before clinical application of this adenoviral system will be feasible， but our results may ultimately lead to an improved therapy of pancreatic cancer.
Characterization of Hypoxia-associated Molecular Features to Aid Hypoxia-Targeted Therapy.,Nat Metab, 2019 Apr,31984309,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31984309/,Tumor hypoxia is a major contributor to resistance to anti-cancer therapies. Given that the results of hypoxia-targeted therapy trials have been disappointing， a more personalized approach may be needed. Here we characterize multi-OMIC molecular features associated with tumor hypoxia and identify molecular alterations that correlate with both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive responses to anti-cancer drugs. Based on a well-established hypoxia gene expression signature， we classify about 10，000 tumor samples into hypoxia score-high and score-low groups across different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrate their prognostic associations. We then identify various types of molecular features associated with hypoxia status that correlate with drug resistance but， in some cases， also with drug sensitivity， contrasting the conventional view that hypoxia confers drug resistance. We further show that 110 out of 121 (90.9%) clinically actionable genes can be affected by hypoxia status and experimentally validate the predicted effects of hypoxia on the response to several drugs in cultured cells. Our study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of tumor hypoxia and may have practical implications for clinical cancer therapy.
Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) is required for the transcriptomic response of the nucleoside-derived drug 5'-DFUR in breast cancer MCF7 cells.,Biochem Pharmacol, 2006 Dec 15,16965766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16965766/,Nucleoside analogues are broadly used in cancer treatment. Although nucleoside metabolism is a necessary step in the development of their cytotoxicity， mediated transport across the plasma membrane might be needed for nucleoside-derived drugs to exert their pharmacological action. In this study， we have addressed the question of whether particular plasma membrane transporters contribute to the transcriptomic response associated with nucleoside-derived drug therapy. Firstly， we have characterized the nucleoside transporters responsible for 5'-DFUR uptake into the breast cancer cell line MCF7. 5'-DFUR is the immediate precursor of 5-FU and a metabolite of the orally administered pro-drug capecitabine， currently used in the treatment of breast cancer and other solid tumors. Although 5'-DFUR is a substrate for both plasma membrane equilibrative nucleoside carriers， hENT1 shows higher affinity for this molecule than hENT2. Inhibition of hENT1 function partially protected MCF7 cells from 5'-DFUR-induced cytotoxicity. Secondly， we have used a pharmacogenomic approach to determine how inhibition of hENT1 function contributes to the transcriptomic response associated to 5'-DFUR treatment. Under hENT1 inhibition most of the transcriptional targets of 5'-DFUR action， which were genes associated with apoptosis and cell cycle progression were blocked. This study demonstrates that although 5'-DFUR is substrate for both equilibrative nucleoside carriers， hENT1 function is essential for the full transcriptional response to 5'-DFUR treatment.
Changes in gene expression pattern of human primary macrophages induced by carbosilane dendrimer 2G-NN16.,Pharm Res, 2009 Mar,19034630,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19034630/,Purpose:The use of dendrimers for biomedical applications has emerged with promising results. 2G-NN16 is a carbosilane dendrimer with sixteen positive charges per molecule tested to be capable to bind and release antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) and small interference RNA (siRNA) in vitro. In spite of low cytotoxicity observed for these dendrimers， little is known about cellular changes they produce in cells in general and in immune cells in particular.Materials and methods:Genomic technologies allow us to identify global gene expression profile changes in macrophages exposed to a non-toxic concentration (5 microM) of 2G-NN16， alone or complexed with a random siRNA (dendriplex). Results were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.Results:Exposing macrophages to this dendrimer or dendriplex causes multiple gene expression changes， but no specific action of random siRNA was detected. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes shows the altered functions to be immune response， proliferation and transcription regulation. Interleukin 17F (IL17F) was the most regulated gene.Conclusions:Global gene expression profiles are a highly sensitive method to measure the toxicity degree of a gene delivery vehicle. The strong repression of IL17F， IL23R and IL23A， all of which are involved in autoimmune disease， by this particular dendrimer suggests a potential pharmacological application.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators: discrimination of agonistic versus antagonistic activities by gene expression profiling in breast cancer cells.,Cancer Res, 2004 Feb 15,14973112,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14973112/,Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen are effective in the treatment of many estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers and have also proven to be effective in the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease. The comparative abilities of tamoxifen versus raloxifene in breast cancer prevention are currently being compared in the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene trial. To better understand the actions of these compounds in breast cancer， we have examined their effects on the expression of approximately 12，000 genes， using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays， with quantitative PCR verification in many cases， categorizing their actions as agonist， antagonist， or partial agonist/antagonist. Analysis of gene stimulation and inhibition by the SERMs trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) and raloxifene (Ral) or ICI 182，780 (ICI) and by estradiol (E2) in estrogen receptor-containing MCF-7 human breast cancer cells revealed that (a) TOT was the most E2-like of the three compounds， (b) all three compounds either partially or fully antagonized the action of E2 on most genes， with the order of antagonist activity being ICI > Ral > TOT， (c) TOT and Ral， but not ICI， displayed partial agonist/partial antagonist activity on a number of E2-regulated genes， (d) several stimulatory cell cycle-related genes were down-regulated exclusively by ICI， (e) the estrogen-like activity of Ral nearly always overlapped with that of TOT， indicating that Ral has little unique agonist activity different from that of TOT， and (f) some genes were specifically up-regulated by TOT but not Ral， ICI， or E2. Hence， gene expression profiling can discern fundamental differences among SERMs and provides insight into the distinct biologies of TOT， Ral， and ICI in breast cancer.
Micro(mi)RNA expression profile of breast cancer epithelial cells treated with the anti-diabetic drug metformin: induction of the tumor suppressor miRNA let-7a and suppression of the TGFbeta-induced oncomiR miRNA-181a.,Cell Cycle, 2011 Apr 1,21368581,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21368581/,n unexplored molecular scenario that might explain the inhibitory impact of the anti-diabetic drug metformin on the genesis of breast cancer relates to metformin's ability to modulate the expression status of micro (mi)RNAs. We here report the first miRNA expression profiling of human epithelial breast cancer cells cultured in the presence of metformin. We conducted real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Arrays to quantitatively compare the expression profile of 88 cancer-related miRNA sequences before and after treatment of MCF-7 cells， which were used as well-differentiated， epithelioid cell controls， with graded concentrations of metformin. Metformin-treated MCF-7 cells notably exhibited up to 18-fold increases in miRNA lethal-7a (let-7a) expression compared with untreated control cells. We confirmed that MCF-7 cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in response to the cytokine TGFβ notably up-regulated (~5-fold) miRNA-181a expression and exhibited better mammosphere-forming capabilities. We then explored the ability of metformin to impede TGFβ-enhanced propensity of breast cancer stem cells to form mammospheres in a miRNA-181a-related manner. Remarkably， TGFβ treatment failed to up-regulate miRNA-181a expression in the presence of metformin， which was able to fully abrogate TGFβ-enhanced mammosphere-forming ability. In addition， metformin co-treatment fully prevented TGFβ-induced down-regulation of the tumor suppressor miRNA-96 (~10-fold). Metformin's molecular functioning to prevent invasive breast cancer can be explained in terms of its previously unrecognized ability to efficiently up-regulate the tumor-suppressive miRNAs let-7a & miRNA-96 and inhibit the oncogenic miRNA-181a， thus epigenetically preserving the differentiated phenotype of mammary epithelium while preventing EMT-related cancer-initiating cell self-renewal.
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 as a frequently silenced tumor suppressor gene in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Hepatology, 2007 May,17464989,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17464989/,In HCC， inactivation of tumor suppressor genes plays a significant role in carcinogenesis. Apart from deletions and mutations， growing evidence has indicated that epigenetic alterations including aberrant promoter methylation and histone deacetylation are also implicated in inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The goal of this study was to identify epigenetically silenced candidate tumor suppressor genes in human HCC by comparing the changes in oligonucleotide microarray gene expression profiles in HCC cell lines upon pharmacological treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC). By analyzing the gene expression profiles， we selected tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2)， a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor， for validation and further characterization. Our results showed that TFPI-2 was frequently silenced in human HCC and HCC cell lines. TFPI-2 was significantly underexpressed in approximately 90% of primary HCCs when compared with their corresponding nontumorous livers. TFPI-2 promoter methylation was detected in 80% of HCC cell lines and 47% of human HCCs and was accompanied by reduced TFPI-2 messenger RNA expression. In addition， TFPI-2 expression in HCC cell lines can be robustly restored by combined treatment with 5-Aza-dC and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. These findings indicate that TFPI-2 is frequently silenced in human HCC via epigenetic alterations， including promoter methylation and histone deacetylation. Moreover， ectopic overexpression of TFPI-2 significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cells.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that TFPI-2 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in human HCC.
Glutamine synthetase is a genetic determinant of cell type-specific glutamine independence in breast epithelia.,PLoS Genet, 2011 Aug,21852960,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21852960/,lthough significant variations in the metabolic profiles exist among different cells， little is understood in terms of genetic regulations of such cell type-specific metabolic phenotypes and nutrient requirements. While many cancer cells depend on exogenous glutamine for survival to justify the therapeutic targeting of glutamine metabolism， the mechanisms of glutamine dependence and likely response and resistance of such glutamine-targeting strategies among cancers are largely unknown. In this study， we have found a systematic variation in the glutamine dependence among breast tumor subtypes associated with mammary differentiation: basal- but not luminal-type breast cells are more glutamine-dependent and may be susceptible to glutamine-targeting therapeutics. Glutamine independence of luminal-type cells is associated mechanistically with lineage-specific expression of glutamine synthetase (GS). Luminal cells can also rescue basal cells in co-culture without glutamine， indicating a potential for glutamine symbiosis within breast ducts. The luminal-specific expression of GS is directly induced by GATA3 and represses glutaminase expression. Such distinct glutamine dependency and metabolic symbiosis is coupled with the acquisition of the GS and glutamine independence during the mammary differentiation program. Understanding the genetic circuitry governing distinct metabolic patterns is relevant to many symbiotic relationships among different cells and organisms. In addition， the ability of GS to predict patterns of glutamine metabolism and dependency among tumors is also crucial in the rational design and application of glutamine and other metabolic pathway targeted therapies.

Gene expression profiling of breast cancer cells in response to gemcitabine: NF-kappaB pathway activation as a potential mechanism of resistance.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2007 Apr,17039268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17039268/,Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with clinical relevance in the treatment of several solid tumors， including breast carcinoma. In spite of its cytotoxic effect， clinical efficacy is impaired by the development of resistance. We performed gene expression analysis to shed light into the molecular mechanism of action of this drug in two breast cancer cell lines. Activation of genes related with cell cycle， cell growth and apoptosis (BNIP3L， CCNG2， DDIT4， TGFB2， TP53BP1， TP53INP1， and VEGF) was the main finding in the p53-wild type cell line MCF7， while the p53-non-functional cell line MDA-MB-231 was characterized by the regulation of NF-kappaB target genes (BIRC3， CXCL1/GRO1， IRAK2， TNF， TNFAIP and TRAF1). Genes consistently induced (ATF3， CCNG2， CDKN1A， EGR1， INSIG1， and MAF) or repressed (CCND1 and VGF) in both cell lines， were also found after gemcitabine treatment. In addition， MDA-MB-231 cells showed a higher basal and induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity after treatment with gemcitabine. In comparison with gemcitabine， gene expression after 5-fluorouracil treatment showed essentially different profiles in both cell lines. This， in spite of using equitoxic concentrations producing similar effects on cell cycle. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in MDA-MB-231 cells was dependent on IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation， as shown by functional experiments using the specific inhibitor BAY11-7082. Moreover， immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples of breast carcinoma further validated the induction of NF-kappaB expression and IkappaB down-regulation upon neoadjuvant gemcitabine treatment. Thus， gene expression patterns， in vitro functional studies and analysis of tissue samples are in agreement with a role for NF-kappaB pathway in gemcitabine response. Together with the reported role for NF-kappaB in the induction of resistance to chemotherapy， our data gives support to clinical strategies combining gemcitabine with NF-kappaB inhibitors in breast cancer.
Transcriptome of primary adipocytes from obese women in response to a novel hydroxycitric acid-based dietary supplement.,DNA Cell Biol, 2007 Sep,17708719,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17708719/,Background:Obesity is a global public health problem. Traditional herbal medicines may have some potential in managing obesity. The dried fruit rind of Garcinia cambogia， also known as Malabar tamarind， is a unique source of (-)-hydroxycitric acid (HCA)， which exhibits a distinct sour taste and has been safely used for centuries in Southeastern Asia to make meals more filling. Recently it has been demonstrated that when taken orally， a novel， highly soluble calcium/potassium salt of HCA (HCA-SX) is safe and bioavailable in the human plasma. Although HCA-SX seems to be conditionally effective in weight management in experimental animals and in humans， its mechanism of action remains unclear.Methods:In this study， subcutaneous preadipocytes collected from obese women with body mass index>25 kg/m2 were differentiated to adipocytes for 2 weeks in culture. The effects of low-dose HCA-SX on lipid metabolism and on the adipocyte transcriptome were tested. HCA-SX augmented isoproterenol- and 3-isobutyryl-1-methylxanthine-induced lipolysis. Using oil red O， the production of lipid storage droplets by the cultured mature human adipocytes was visualized and enumerated.Results:HCA-SX caused droplet dispersion facilitating lipase action on the lipids. HCA-SX markedly induced leptin expression in the adipocytes. In the microarray analyses， a total of 54，676 probe sets were screened. HCA-SX resulted in significant down-regulation of 348， and induction of 366 fat- and obesity-related genes. HCA-SX induced transactivation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)， a novel approach in the management of obesity.Conclusion:Taken together， the net effects support the antilipolytic and antiadipogenic effects of HCA-SX. Further human studies are warranted.
PDPN contributes to constructing immunosuppressive microenvironment in IDH wildtype glioma.,Cancer Gene Ther, 2023 Feb,36434176,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36434176/,The tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (IME) significantly affects tumor occurrence， progression， and prognosis， but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to make known. We investigated the prognostic significance of PDPN and its role in IME in glioma. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) found PDPN closely related to IDH wildtype status and higher immune score. Correlation analysis suggested PDPN was highly positively relevant to immune checkpoints expression and immune checkpoints block responding status. Correlation analysis together with verification in vitro suggested PDPN highly positively relevant tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression employed to develop the prediction model with TANs and TAMs markers showed that high risk scores predicted worse prognosis. We highlight that PDPN overexpression is an independent prognostic indicator， and promotes macrophage M2 polarization and neutrophil degranulation， ultimately devotes to the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Our findings contribute to re-recognizing the role of PDPN in IDH wildtype gliomas and implicate promising target therapy combined with immunotherapy for this highly malignant tumor.

Mining Natural Products with Anticancer Biological Activity through a Systems Biology Approach.,Oxid Med Cell Longev, 2021 Aug 12,34422220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34422220/,Natural products， like turmeric， are considered powerful antioxidants which exhibit tumor-inhibiting activity and chemoradioprotective properties. Nowadays， there is a great demand for developing novel， affordable， efficacious， and effective anticancer drugs from natural resources. In the present study， we have employed a stringent in silico methodology to mine and finally propose a number of natural products， retrieved from the biomedical literature. Our main target was the systematic search of anticancer products as anticancer agents compatible to the human organism for future use. In this case and due to the great plethora of such products， we have followed stringent bioinformatics methodologies. Our results taken together suggest that natural products of a great diverse may exert cytotoxic effects in a maximum of the studied cancer cell lines. These natural compounds and active ingredients could possibly be combined to exert potential chemopreventive effects. Furthermore， in order to substantiate our findings and their application potency at a systems biology level， we have developed a representative， user-friendly， publicly accessible biodatabase， NaturaProDB， containing the retrieved natural resources， their active ingredients/fractional mixtures， the types of cancers that they affect， and the corresponding experimentally verified target genes.

Shifting gene expression profiles during ex vivo culture of renal tumor cells: implications for cancer immunotherapy.,Oncol Res, 2003,14760862,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14760862/,The use of cultured tumor cells rather than original tumor tissue for the preparation of therapeutic cancer vaccines represents an obvious solution to the problem of availability of adequate quantities of autologous tumor. In this study we investigated possible changes in gene expression accompanying the transition of renal cell carcinoma cells from the original tissue to cell populations in culture. In our study we employed cDNA microarray technology to compare the gene expression pattern of ex vivo cultured renal carcinoma cells to that of the original solid tumor tissue from which the cells were derived. Using this approach we detected changes in the expression of many genes mostly related to the cell lines' physiological properties. Some of the products of those genes showing differential expression between tumor-derived cell line and original tumor are known human autoantigens or tumor-associated antigens. Furthermore， analysis of overexpressed genes revealed the presence of several transcripts with restricted normal tissue distribution， representing self-antigens with potential to elicit autoimmunity. Our results suggest that adapting tumor tissue to culture can result in changes in the level of transcripts specific for known antigens and that more information regarding the composition of tumor cells and their byproducts used in vaccine trials is needed before the efficacy and safety of such procedures can truly be determined.
Cudraflavone C Induces Tumor-Specific Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer Cells through Inhibition of the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)-AKT Pathway.,PLoS One, 2017 Jan 20,28107519,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28107519/,Cudraflavone C (Cud C) is a naturally-occurring flavonol with reported anti-proliferative activities. However， the mechanisms by which Cud C induced cytotoxicity have yet to be fully elucidated. Here， we investigated the effects of Cud C on cell proliferation， caspase activation andapoptosis induction in colorectal cancer cells (CRC). We show that Cud C inhibits cell proliferation in KM12， Caco-2， HT29， HCC2998， HCT116 and SW48 CRC but not in the non-transformed colorectal epithelial cells， CCD CoN 841. Cud C induces tumor-selective apoptosis via mitochondrial depolarization and activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway. Gene expression profiling by microarray analyses revealed that tumor suppressor genes EGR1， HUWE1 and SMG1 were significantly up-regulated while oncogenes such as MYB1， CCNB1 and GPX2 were down-regulated following treatment with Cud C. Further analyses using Connectivity Map revealed that Cud C induced a gene signature highly similar to that of protein synthesis inhibitors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT inhibitors， suggesting that Cud C might inhibit PI3K-AKT signaling. A luminescent cell free PI3K lipid kinase assay revealed that Cud C significantly inhibited p110β/p85α PI3K activity， followed by p120γ， p110δ/p85α， and p110α/p85α PI3K activities. The inhibition by Cud C on p110β/p85α PI3K activity was comparable to LY-294002， a known PI3K inhibitor. Cud C also inhibited phosphorylation of AKT independent of NFκB activity in CRC cells， while ectopic expression of myristoylated AKT completely abrogated the anti-proliferative effects， and apoptosis induced by Cud C in CRC. These findings demonstrate that Cud C induces tumor-selective cytotoxicity by targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of Cud C， and indicate that Cud C further development of Cud C derivatives as potential therapeutic agents is warranted.
In silico RNA isoform screening to identify potential cancer driver exons with therapeutic applications.,Nat Commun, 2024 Aug 15,39147755,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39147755/,lternative splicing is crucial for cancer progression and can be targeted pharmacologically， yet identifying driver exons genome-wide remains challenging. We propose identifying such exons by associating statistically gene-level cancer dependencies from knockdown viability screens with splicing profiles and gene expression. Our models predict the effects of splicing perturbations on cell proliferation from transcriptomic data， enabling in silico RNA screening and prioritizing targets for splicing-based therapies. We identified 1，073 exons impacting cell proliferation， many from genes not previously linked to cancer. Experimental validation confirms their influence on proliferation， especially in highly proliferative cancer cell lines. Integrating pharmacological screens with splicing dependencies highlights the potential driver exons affecting drug sensitivity. Our models also allow predicting treatment outcomes from tumor transcriptomes， suggesting applications in precision oncology. This study presents an approach to identifying cancer driver exon and their therapeutic potential， emphasizing alternative splicing as a cancer target.
Ultrasound-induced apoptosis in the presence of Sonazoid and associated alterations in gene expression levels: a possible therapeutic application.,Cancer Lett, 2010 Feb 1,19646810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19646810/,Ultrasound (US) has been shown to induce apoptosis and cell lysis in cancer cells. In this study， we report on the potential of using Sonazoid， a new echo-contrast agent， that is chemically more stable and US-resistant in combination with US in cancer therapy. The biological effects and their mechanisms in the presence or absence of ultrasonic exposure in vitro were investigated. In addition， the impact of the agent on the expression levels of genes responsive to US was studied using global-scale microarrays and computational gene expression analysis tools. Our results show that the combination led to enhanced cell killing in the presence of 1 MHz acoustic field. The apoptosis induction was shown to be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. The occurrence of US-induced DNA damage was also observed. Despite these findings， the agent at concentrations similar to those clinically used can be considered as well tolerated. Furthermore， Sonazoid enhanced expression of genes that related to apoptosis and are responsive to US， although it alone had almost no effect. These results indicate the potential of Sonazoid for US contrast enhancement as well as the possibility of its use in US-aided therapies.
Thalidomide and Its Analogs Differentially Target Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors: Thalidomide Suppresses FGFR Gene Expression while Pomalidomide Dampens FGFR2 Activity.,Chem Res Toxicol, 2019 Apr 15,30834740,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30834740/,Thalidomide is an infamous teratogen and it is continuously being explored for its anticancer properties. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are implicated in embryo development and cancer pathophysiology. With striking similarities observed between FGFR implicated conditions and thalidomide embryopathy， we hypothesized thalidomide targets FGFRs. We utilized three different cell lines and chicken embryo model to investigate the effects of thalidomide and analogs on FGFR expression. We performed molecular docking， KINOMEscan analysis， and kinase activity assays to study the drug-protein interactions. The expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 was differentially regulated by all the three drugs in cells as well as in developing organs. Transcriptome analysis of thalidomide-treated chick embryo strongly suggests the modulation of FGFR signaling and key transcription factors. Corroboration with previous studies suggests that thalidomide might affect FGFR expression through the transcription factor， E2F1. At the protein level， molecular docking predicted all three analogs to interact with lysine residue at 517th and 508th positions of FGFR2 and FGFR3， respectively. This lysine coordinates the ATP binding site of FGFR， thus hinting at the possible perturbation of FGFR activity by thalidomide. Kinome analysis revealed that kinase activities of FGFR2 and FGFR3 (G697C) reduced by 31% and 65%， respectively， in the presence of 10 μM thalidomide. Further， we checked and confirmed that the analogs inhibited the FGFR2 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. This study suggests that FGFRs could be potential targets of thalidomide and the two analogs， and also endorses the link between the teratogenicity and antitumor activities of the drugs.
In vitro models for the study of the effect of butyrate on human colon adenocarcinoma cells.,Toxicol In Vitro, 2007 Mar,17084582,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17084582/,The effect of butyrate has been analyzed on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines with different properties regarding tumorigenicity， differentiation and resistance to apoptosis induced by this agent. Butyrate reduces cell proliferation， induces differentiation (according to alkaline phosphatase activity) and apoptosis， being these effects time- and concentration-dependent. The susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of butyrate depends on the cell line considered and it is not directly related to tumorigenicity or differentiation. We show that 2mM butyrate treatment of non-tumorigenic BCS-TC2 cells for four days strongly influences the transcriptional activity， causing extensive modification in gene expression patterns (69 up-regulated and 109 down-regulated genes). Some of these genes are involved in the modulation of cell cycle progression， apoptosis and differentiation. We have analyzed the effect of butyrate in spontaneous or induced multicellular spheroids. The more stable spheroids (spontaneous or induced from butyrate-resistant cells) increase the resistance of cells to the effects of butyrate probably due to an impaired accessibility. This in vitro model could be useful to study the resistance of tumors to the effect of natural regulators (i.e. butyrate) as well as to develop and test new therapeutic approaches.

Alterations of metastasis-related genes identified using an oligonucleotide microarray of genistein-treated HCC1395 breast cancer cells.,Nutr Cancer, 2007,17640171,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17640171/,Genistein， one of the major isoflavones， potently inhibits the growth and metastasis of breast cancer. However， the precise molecular mechanism in metastasis inhibition is not clear. We investigated the effect of genistein in HCC1395 cells， a cell line derived from an early-stage primary breast cancer. Genistein dose dependently both decreased cell viability and inhibited the invasion potential. We used human oligonucleotide microarrays to determine the gene expression profile altered by genistein treatment. TFPI-2， ATF3， DNMT1， and MTCBP-1， which inhibit invasion and metastasis， were upregulated， and MMP-2， MMP-7， and CXCL12， which promote invasion and metastasis， were downregulated. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to verify the microarray data at the mRNA level. We conclude that genistein-induced alternations of gene expression involving metastasis may be exploited for devising chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies， particularly for early-stage breast cancer.
The gene expression profiles of medulloblastoma cell lines resistant to preactivated cyclophosphamide.,Curr Cancer Drug Targets, 2008 May,18473730,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18473730/,The total expression profiles of two medulloblastoma cell lines resistant to the preactivated form of cyclophosphamide (4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide， 4-HC) were examined using the Affymetrix GeneChip U133A array. Our primary objective was to look for possible genes， other than the well-studied aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) that may be involved in cyclophosphamide (CP) resistance in medulloblastomas. We present here the lists of the most highly upregulated [30 for D341 MED (4-HCR); 20 for D283 MED (4-HCR)] and downregulated [19 for D341 MED (4-HCR); 15 for D283 MED (4-HCR)] genes which may be involved in conferring CP-resistance to the two medullobalstoma cell lines. The lists of genes from the two sublines almost had no overlap， suggesting different mechanisms of CP-resistance. One of the most noteworthy upregulated gene is TAP1 [90-fold increase in D341 MED (4-HCR) relative to D341 MED]. TAP1， a protein belonging to the ABC transporter family is normally involved in major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) antigen processing. This suggests the possible role of multidrug resistance (MDR)， albeit atypical (which means it does not involve the usual MDR1 and MRP glycoproteins)， in medulloblastoma's CP-resistance. Apart from TAP1， a number of other genes involved in MHC1 processing were upregulated in D341 MED (4HCR). D341 MED (4-HCR) also had a 20-fold increase in the expression of the aldo-keto reductase gene， AKR1B10， which may deactivate the reactive cyclophosphamide metabolite， aldophosphamide. For D283 MED (4-HCR)， the most notable increase in expression is that of ALDH1B1， a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family of proteins.
Progestin upregulates G-protein-coupled receptor 30 in breast cancer cells.,Eur J Biochem, 2002 May,12027886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12027886/, differential display method was used to study genes the expression of which is altered during growth inhibition induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). A transcript of G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) was upregulated by MPA in estrogen-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Northern-blot analysis showed a progestin-specific primary target gene， which was enhanced by progesterone and different progestins， but not by dihydrotestosterone or dexamethasone， and which was abrogated by antiprogestin RU486. The dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in GPR30 mRNA expression correlated with MPA-induced growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells. Additionally， GPR30 upregulation by progestin correlated with growth inhibition when a comparison was made between different breast cancer cell lines. The ERK1/ERK2 pathway is capable of inducing progesterone receptor-dependent and ligand-dependent transcription. Thus we sought to establish whether different MAPK pathway inhibitors affect progestin-induced GPR30 mRNA regulation. The regulation of GPR30 was independent of ERK pathway activation， but the p38 pathway inhibitor induced GPR30 expression， which suggested a potential gene regulation pathway. These data demonstrate a new progestin target gene， the expression of which correlates with growth inhibition.
Gene expression profile and toxic effects in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to zearalenone.,PLoS One, 2014 May 2,24788721,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24788721/,Zearalenone (ZEA)， a mycoestrogen produced by Fusarium fungal species， is mainly found in cereal crops such as maize， wheat and barley. Although ZEA has been reported to be present in air， little is known about the health risk or the molecular basis of action when lung cells are exposed to ZEA. As ZEA has a similar structure to estrogen， its potential risk as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) has thus aroused both environmental and public health concerns. The purpose of this study is to identify the responses and underlying molecular changes that occur when human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells are exposed to ZEA. Differential gene expression profiles were identified in cells that were treated with 40 µM ZEA for 6 h and 24 h by high-throughput microarray analysis using Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 GeneChip. The array results showed that after ZEA treatment， 262 genes at 6 h and 1073 genes at 24 h were involved in the differential regulation. Pathway analysis revealed that diverse cellular processes were affected when lung cells were exposed to ZEA resulting in impaired response to DNA damage， cell cycle arrest， down-regulation of inflammatory responses and alterations of epigenetic marks. Results of further experiments indicated that 40 µM ZEA decreased cell viability， induced apoptosis and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in a time-dependent manner. Immuno-suppressive effects of ZEA were further revealed through the suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6， IL-8 and IL-1β). Interestingly， the level of global DNA methylation was markedly decreased after 24 h exposure to ZEA. Collectively， these observations suggested that a broad range of toxic effects are elicited by ZEA. Particularly， ROS may play a pivotal role in ZEA-induced cell death. These adverse effects observed in lung cells suggest that exposure to ZEA may increase susceptibility of lung cells to diseases and required further investigations.
A Biologically-Based Computational Approach to Drug Repurposing for Anthrax Infection.,Toxins (Basel), 2017 Mar 10,28287432,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28287432/,Developing drugs to treat the toxic effects of lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET) produced byB. anthracisis of global interest.We utilized a computational approach to score 474 drugs/compounds for their ability to reverse the toxic effects of anthrax toxins. For each toxin or drug/compound， we constructed an activity network by using its differentially expressed genes， molecular targets， and protein interactions. Gene expression profiles of drugs were obtained from the Connectivity Map and those of anthrax toxins in human alveolar macrophages were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Drug rankings were based on the ability of a drug/compound's mode of action in the form of a signaling network to reverse the effects of anthrax toxins; literature reports were used to verify the top 10 and bottom 10 drugs/compounds identified. Simvastatin and bepridil with reported in vitro potency for protecting cells from LT and ET toxicities were computationally ranked fourth and eighth. The other top 10 drugs were fenofibrate， dihydroergotamine， cotinine， amantadine， mephenytoin， sotalol， ifosfamide， and mefloquine; literature mining revealed their potential protective effects from LT and ET toxicities. These drugs are worthy of investigation for their therapeutic benefits and might be used in combination with antibiotics for treatingB. anthracisinfection.Keywords:anthrax; computation; drug repurposing; signaling network of a drug.
Cell cycle， apoptosis， cellular uptake and whole-transcriptome microarray gene expression analysis of HeLa cells treated with a ruthenium(II)-arene complex with an isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid ligand.,J Inorg Biochem, 2016 Oct,27118029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27118029/,Ruthenium(II)-arene complexes are promising drug candidates for the therapy of solid tumors. In previous work， seven new compounds of the general formula [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(L1-7)Cl] were synthesized and characterized， of which the complex with L=isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (RuT7) was two times as active on HeLa cells compared to normal cell line MRC-5， as indicated by IC50values determined after 48h of incubation (45.4±3.0 vs. 84.2±5.7μM， respectively). In the present study， cell cycle analysis of HeLa cells treated with RuT7showed S phase arrest and an increase in sub-G1 population. The apoptotic potential of the title compound was confirmed with the Annexin V-FITC/PI assay together with a morphological evaluation of cells using fluorescent microscopy. Analysis of the intracellular accumulation of ruthenium showed 8.9ng Ru/106cells after 6h of incubation. To gain further insight in the molecular mechanism of action of RuT7on HeLa cells， a whole-transcriptome microarray gene expression analysis was performed. Analysis of functional categories and signaling and biochemical pathways associated with the response of HeLa cells to treatment with RuT7showed that it leads the cells through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway， via indirect DNA damage due to the action of reactive oxygen species， and through direct DNA binding of RuT7. Statistical analysis for enrichment of gene sets associated with known drug-induced toxicities identified fewer associated toxicity profiles in RuT7-treated cells compared to cisplatin treatment. Altogether these results provide the basis for further development of RuT7in animal and pre-clinical studies as a potential drug candidate.Keywords:Anticancer drugs; Apoptosis; HeLa; Microarray; Ruthenium(II).
Study on the anti-endotoxin effect of sinomenine using an Agilent genome array.,QJM, 2018 Mar 1,29240916,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29240916/,Background:Endotoxin is a significant contributing factor underlying the occurrence of fever， diarrhea， inflammation， edema， coagulation， shock and other syndromes associated with gram-negative bacterial infections. To date， there is no effective treatment for endotoxemia.Aim:The aim of this study was to characterize differentially expressed genes in sinomenine-treated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial cells by microarray analysis and to determine the potential pharmacological activity of sinomenine.Design:The cultured cells of five treatment groups (n = 3) were collected. Participants: total RNA was extracted and subjected to Agilent Porcine 4 × 44 K whole genome microarray.Methods:Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and gene ontology software were applied to screen and analyze differentially regulated genes.Results:The results showed that 723 differentially regulated genes were identified including 410 up-regulated genes and 313 down-regulated genes in therapy group vs. LPS group. Ten genes may be key controlled genes in the pathogenesis of LPS， including five up-regulated genes (ARG1， TLR2， IL1A， VCAM1， DKK3) and five down-regulated genes (HABP2， ID1， CHDH， GPX3， PTGFR)， which primarily contribute to biological processes such as inflammatory response， vascular lesion， metabolic process and cell cycle. IL1A and FMO3 were considered as potent target genes.Conclusion:Global gene expression profile analysis showed that sinomenine might effectively be useful to regulate inflammatory responses as part of future anti-endotoxin therapies.
Expression profiling of glucocorticoid-treated T-ALL cell lines: rapid repression of multiple genes involved in RNA-， protein- and nucleotide synthesis.,Oncogene, 2001 Jul 19,11466613,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11466613/,To arrive at a better understanding of the effects of the glucocorticoid component of chemotherapy protocols on lymphocytic leukemia cells， we analysed early responses of T-lymphocytic leukemia cell lines Jurkat and CEM-C7， both of which undergo apoptosis in response to dexamethasone， via gene chips. Among genes identified as repressed， a notable cluster seemed to be of importance for the processes of transcription， mRNA splicing and protein synthesis. Consequently， we assessed time-resolved uptake of uridine and methionine to monitor RNA and protein synthesis， along with parameters quantifying apoptosis. Repression of uptake to about 65% of that in untreated cells preceded the first sign of apoptosis by several hours in both cell lines. In addition to this general repression of RNA and protein synthesis， several genes were found to be regulated that may contribute to synergistic action of glucocorticoids with other components of frequently used chemotherapy protocols such as antimetabolites， methotrexate and alkylating agents.
Investigating the potential molecular players and therapeutic drug molecules in carfilzomib resistant multiple myeloma by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.,Leuk Lymphoma, 2022 Nov,35700001,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35700001/,Multiple myeloma (MM)， second most common hematological malignancy， still remains beyond cure because of acquirement of drug resistance. Proteasome inhibitor such as carfilzomib (Cfz) therapy which has been used as one of the key therapies against MM recently， is obstructed by the incidence of Cfz resistance. The underlying mechanism of this acquired Cfz resistance in MM is very little understood. Therefore， the current study was aimed to investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)， associated micro RNAs (miRNAs)， and transcription factors (TFs) from the microarray datasets of Cfz resistant and Cfz sensitive MM cell lines， obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. DEGs were detected using GEO2R tool from two datasets and common DEGs were identified through Venn diagram. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed on DAVID database. Through STRING database and Cytoscape tool， protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed. Genetic alterations in DEGs were investigated using COSMIC database. Interaction network between DEGs and miRNAs as well as TFs were obtained and constructed by using mirDIP， TRRUST， and miRNet tools. Drug gene interaction analysis was performed to identify potential drug molecules on DGIdb tool. Several common DEGs were identified in Cfz resistant MM. PDGF， VEGF， and Wnt signaling pathways were significantly enriched and might be involved in MM progression. miRNA analysis identified hsa-mir-124-3p， hsa-mir-26a-5p that can target DEGs. Various drug molecules such as dabrafenib， vemurafenib， and venetoclax that could potentially attenuate the MM pathophysiology， were detected. The entire study might provide a new understanding about the Cfz resistance in MM.Keywords:Multiple myeloma; bioinformatics analysis; carfilzomib resistance; differentially expressed genes; drug molecules; miRNAs.
Genome-wide microarray expression and genomic alterations by array-CGH analysis in neuroblastoma stem-like cells.,PLoS One, 2014 Nov 13,25392930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25392930/,Neuroblastoma has a very diverse clinical behaviour: from spontaneous regression to a very aggressive malignant progression and resistance to chemotherapy. This heterogeneous clinical behaviour might be due to the existence of Cancer Stem Cells (CSC)， a subpopulation within the tumor with stem-like cell properties: a significant proliferation capacity， a unique self-renewal capacity， and therefore， a higher ability to form new tumors. We enriched the CSC-like cell population content of two commercial neuroblastoma cell lines by the use of conditioned cell culture media for neurospheres， and compared genomic gains and losses and genome expression by array-CGH and microarray analysis， respectively (in CSC-like versus standard tumor cells culture). Despite the array-CGH did not show significant differences between standard and CSC-like in both analyzed cell lines， the microarray expression analysis highlighted some of the most relevant biological processes and molecular functions that might be responsible for the CSC-like phenotype. Some signalling pathways detected seem to be involved in self-renewal of normal tissues (Wnt， Notch， Hh and TGF-β) and contribute to CSC phenotype. We focused on the aberrant activation of TGF-β and Hh signalling pathways， confirming the inhibition of repressors of TGF-β pathway， as SMAD6 and SMAD7 by RT-qPCR. The analysis of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway showed overexpression of PTCH1， GLI1 and SMO. We found overexpression of CD133 and CD15 in SIMA neurospheres， confirming that this cell line was particularly enriched in stem-like cells. This work shows a cross-talk among different pathways in neuroblastoma and its importance in CSC-like cells.
Decitabine induces G2/M cell cycle arrest by suppressing p38/NF-κB signaling in human renal clear cell carcinoma.,Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 2015 Sep 1,26617834,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26617834/,Objective:The anti-neoplastic effects of decitabine， an inhibitor of DNA promoter methylation， are beneficial for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however， the mechanism of action of decitabine is unclear. We analyzed gene expression profiling and identified specific pathways altered by decitabine in RCC cells.Methods:Four human RCC cell lines (ACHN， Caki-1， Caki-1， and A498) were used in this study; growth suppression of RCC cells by decitabine was analyzed using the WST-1 assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were examined using flow cytometric analysis. Gene expression of RCC cells induced by decitabine was evaluated with cDNA microarray， and potential biological pathways were selected using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The activity of the p38-NF-κB pathway regulated by decitabine was confirmed by Western blotting.Results:Decitabine suppresses the proliferation of RCC cells in vitro. Although decitabine did not significantly induce apoptosis， decitabine caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression regulated by decitabine in RCC cells was investigated using microarray analysis. Ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1)， interferon inducible protein 27 (IFI27)， and cell division cycle-associated 2 (CDCA2) may be involved in growth suppression of RCC cells by decitabine. The phosphorylation of p38-NF-κB pathway was suppressed by decitabine in RCC cells.Conclusions:We investigated gene expression profiling and pathways modulated by decitabine in RCC cells. Decitabine was shown to suppress the growth of RCC cells via G2/M cell cycle arrest and the p38-NF-κB signaling pathway may play a role in the anti-neoplastic effect of decitabine in RCC cells.Keywords:Renal cell carcinoma; apoptosis; cell cycle arrest; decitabine; gene expression; p38-NF-κB pathway.
Pharmacogenomic identification of c-Myc/Max-regulated genes associated with cytotoxicity of artesunate towards human colon， ovarian and lung cancer cell lines.,Molecules, 2010 Apr 22,20428086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20428086/,Development of novel therapy strategies is one of the major pressing topics of clinical oncology to overcome drug resistance of tumors. Artesunate (ART) is an anti-malarial drug， which also exerts profound cytotoxic activity towards cancer cells. We applied a gene-hunting approach using microarray-based transcriptome-wide mRNA expression profiling and COMPARE analyses. We identified a set of genes， whose expression was associated either with high IC50 values or low IC50 values for ART. Therefore， these genes may function as resistance or sensitivity factors for response of tumor cells towards ART. This viewpoint is conceivable for genes involved in ribosomal activity， drug transport， cellular antioxidant defense， apoptosis， cell proliferation， cell cycle progression etc. An investigation of underlying signal transduction by pathway analysis suggested a role of the signaling pathways related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the tumor suppressor p53. On the other hand， there were genes without obvious functional link to cellular response to ART， such as genes involved in the survival of cochlear outer and inner hair cells etc. We proved the hypothesis that ART influences the activity of transcription factors regulating downstream genes involved or not involved in response of cancer cells towards ART. This would explain the identification of genes with and without obvious relation to the cytotoxic activity of ART by microarray and COMPARE analyses. By analysis of the binding motifs for the transcription factors c-Myc and Max， we indeed found that 53 of 56 genes contained one or more binding sites for c-Myc/Max upstream of the gene-location. We conclude that c-Myc and Max-mediated transcriptional control of gene expression might contribute to the therapeutic effects of ART in cancer cells， but may also confer unwanted side effects by affecting therapy-unrelated genes.
RALY regulate the proliferation and expression of immune/inflammatory response genes via alternative splicing of FOS.,Genes Immun, 2022 Dec,35941292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35941292/,RALY is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in cancer metastasis， prognosis， and chemotherapy resistance in various cancers. However， the molecular mechanism of which is still unclear. We have established RALY overexpression cell lines and studied the effect of RALY on proliferation and apoptosis in HeLa cells. Then we used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes data. Lastly， RT-qPCR experiments had performed to confirm the RNA-seq results. We found that the overexpression of RALY in HeLa cells inhibited proliferation. Moreover， the overexpression of RALY changed the gene expression profile， and the significant upregulation of genes involved immune/inflammatory response related biological process by NOD-like receptor signaling pathway cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The significant downregulation genes involved innate immune response by the Primary immunodeficiency pathway. Notably， IFIT1， IFIT2， IFTI3， IFI44， HERC4， and OASL expression had inhibited by the overexpression of RALY. Furthermore， RALY negatively regulates the expression of transcription factors FOS and FOSB. Notably， we found that 645 alternative splicing events had regulated by overexpression of RALY， which is highly enriched in transcription regulation， RNA splicing， and cell proliferation biological process by the metabolic pathway. We show that RALY regulates the expression of immune/inflammatory response-related genes via alternative splicing of FOS in HeLa cells. The novel role of RALY in regulating immune/inflammatory gene expression may explain its function in regulating chemotherapy resistance and provides novel insights into further exploring the molecular mechanism of RALY in regulating cancer immunity and chemo/immune therapies.
Diet composition transiently modulates proliferative and potency features of human cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells.,Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 2014 Oct,25256683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25256683/,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) emerged in the last few years as a promise in regenerative medicine and have been actively tested in several clinical trials worldwide. However， the lack of common standards and a precise definition of MSC preparations remain a major obstacle in research and application. In this study， we compared the effects during culture of two different MSC commercial media (aMEM and SPE-IV) on the proliferative capacities， phenotypic and molecular features in human cord blood derived-MSC lines. Moreover， as miRNA are markers of stem cell multipotency and regulators of somatic cell reprogramming， we performed a miRNome analysis in both conditions. As a result， we observed that SPE-IV promoted a faster growth and modulated stemness and proliferation associated genes such as PDGFRB， p16 and p21. Notably， in aMEM miR-335 and miR-302b， both proposed as putative stemness markers， were upregulated together with miRNAs reported to decrease adipo- and osteogenesis confirming the observed reduced differentiation potential after growth in this condition. Intriguingly， phenotypic divergences were entirely due to culturing conditions and， most importantly， completely transitory since， after medium switch， the cells were able to revert their signatures. Thus， it emerges as crucial keeping constant the experimental settings， starting from culturing conditions， to avoid misleading characterization of stemness and/or potency markers when the eventual goal is unequivocal definition of such parameters for future clinical choice.Keywords:Mesenchymal stem cells; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Regenerative medicine; mRNA; miRNA.
Gene expression profiles in human mesothelioma cell lines in response to interferon-gamma treatment.,Cancer Genet Cytogenet, 2004 Jul 1,15193440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15193440/,Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been found to be antiproliferative and antitumoral in malignant mesothelioma (MM)， but the MM cell response to IFN-gamma has not been fully characterized so far. We investigated gene expression profiles in human MM cell lines (HMCLs) exposed to IFN-gamma. Four HMCLs showing different sensitivities to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma， two of them presenting a defect in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway， were treated with 500 IU/mL of IFN-gamma. Gene expression patterns were studied at 6 and 72 hours after exposure to the IFN-gamma， using a cDNA array technique. Six genes were studied with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The gene expression profiles in response to IFN-gamma were shown to differ in different HMCLs. Numerous genes involved in cell proliferation and cell adhesion were regulated by IFN-gamma in JAK/STAT-deficient HMCLs. Genes possibly involved in regulation of cell proliferation included CDC2， PLK1， and IGFBP4， as well as several genes involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion. The cDNA array technique revealed differences in expression pathways， especially those involved in cell growth， cell adhesion， and cell proliferation， between IFN-gamma-resistant and -sensitive MM cell lines. We found that the changes in gene expression profiles of HMCLs exposed to IFN-gamma were also related to features other than the antiproliferative response.
CDK4/6 inhibitors have potent activity in combination with pathway selective therapeutic agents in models of pancreatic cancer.,Oncotarget, 2014 Aug 15,25156567,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25156567/,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor prognosis， in part， due to the therapy-recalcitrant nature of the disease. Loss of the CDK4/6 inhibitor CDKN2A is a signature genetic event in PDA. Therefore， PDA may be amenable to treatment with pharmaceutical CDK4/6 inhibitors. Surprisingly， response to CDK4/6 inhibition was highly variable in PDA models， and associated with differential suppression of gene expression. Mitotic genes were repressed and FOXM1 was uniformly attenuated; however， genes involved in DNA replication were uniquely suppressed in sensitive models. Aberrant induction of Cyclin E1 was associated with resistance， and knockdown demonstrated synergistic suppression of the cell cycle with CDK4/6 inhibition. Combination therapies are likely required for the effective treatment of disease， and drug screening demonstrated additive/antagonistic interactions with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Agents dependent on mitotic progression (taxanes/PLK1 inhibitors) were antagonized by CDK4/6 inhibition， while the response to 5-FU and gemcitabine exhibited drug specific interactions. PI3K/MTOR and MEK inhibitors potently cooperated with CDK4/6 inhibition. These agents were synergistic with CDK4/6 inhibition， blocked the aberrant upregulation of Cyclin E1， and yielded potent inhibition of tumor cell growth. Together， these data identify novel mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitions and provide a roadmap for combination therapies in the treatment of PDA.
Raloxifene covalently bonded to titanium implants by interfacing with (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane affects osteoblast-like cell gene expression.,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol, 2006 Oct-Dec,17166392,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17166392/,Since Raloxifene， a drug used in osteoporosis therapy， inhibits the osteoclast functions but not osteoblast functions， it could improve the recovery during implant surgery. This preliminary report describes a simple method to link， through a covalent bond， Raloxifene to titanium by interfacing with (3-aminopropyl)-Triethoxysilane as assessed by the IR-FT and SEM. To evaluate the biological response of osteoblast-like cells to this implant， we compared expression gene profiling of cell cultures on Raloxifene conjugated implant and normal implant by DNA microarray. By using DNA microarrays containing 19，200 genes， we identified differently expressed genes in osteoblast-like cell line (MG-63). Surface Raloxifene conjugated implants have been shown to have a relevant importance in modifying cell response. This result could be an interesting starting point for the use of an immediate functional loading of implants.
Sensitivity and resistance towards isoliquiritigenin， doxorubicin and methotrexate in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines by pharmacogenomics.,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol, 2010 Sep,20668838,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20668838/,The development of drug resistance in cancer cells necessitates the identification of novel agents with improved activity towards cancer cells. In the present investigation， we compared the cytotoxicity of the chalcone flavonoide， isoliquiritigenin (ISL)， with that of doxorubicin (DOX) and methotrexate (MTX) in five T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cell lines (Jurkat， J-Jhan， J16， HUT78 and Karpas 45). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms which determine the response of T-ALL cells towards ISL， DOX and MTX， we applied array-based matrix comparative genomic hybridisation and microarray-based mRNA expression profiling and compared the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of the cell lines with their 50% inhibition (IC(50)) values for these three drugs. The IC(50) values for ISL did not correlate with those for DOX or MTX， indicating that ISL was still active in DOX- or MTX-unresponsive cell lines. Likewise， the genomic imbalances of chromosomal clones and mRNA expression profile significantly correlating with IC(50) values for ISL were different from thoses correlating with IC(50) values for DOX and MTX. In conclusion， ISL represents a cytotoxic natural product with activity towards T-ALL cell lines. There was no cross-resistance between ISL and DOX or MTX， and the genomic and transcriptomic profiles pointed to different molecular modes of action of ISL as compared to DOX and MTX， indicating that ISL may be a valuable adjunct for cancer therapy to treat otherwise drug-resistant tumours.
Time-resolved gene expression profiling of human squamous cell carcinoma cells during the apoptosis process induced by photodynamic treatment with hypericin.,Int J Oncol, 2009 Oct,19724930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19724930/,Hypericin is used as a powerful naturally occurring photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Activated by visible light， it kills tumour cells and tissues via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Depending on the protocol， apoptotic cell death can be achieved very effectively by hypericin-PDT. To analyze the fundamental molecular mechanisms leading to apoptosis induced by photodamage especially with regard to human skin cancer cells， we studied the alteration of the gene expression pattern in the human squamous cell carcinoma cell line A-431 at 1.5， 3， 5 and 8 h after hypericin-PDT by cDNA-macroarray technique. Radioactively labelled samples were hybridized onto macroarray filters containing PCR products of 9738 ESTs of the Incyte Human UniGEM Microarray clone set. In total， 168 genes were found to be differentially upregulated and 45 down-regulated. Verification of expression changes of 45 genes of interest was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Due to the observed significant expression changes the following can be concluded: lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis could play a role in the uptake of lipophilic hypericin. Extracellular signal transduction to the cell is reduced， cell detachment facilitated， changes of the morphology， cytoskeleton and formation of apoptotic bodies occur. The promotion of p38MAPK， ERK， JNK and Ras signalling pathways supports survival and/or apoptosis. Switches between life and death could be the strongly upregulated transcription factors c-jun and FOSB as well as the MAPK-phosphatase 1 DUSP-1， possibly activated via H3 histone modifications. ROS activate ER-stress pathways or adaptive response， and provoke damage protection against ROS， partly in a cell-type specific way.
DNA microarray profiling of genes differentially regulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitors vorinostat and LBH589 in colon cancer cell lines.,BMC Med Genomics, 2009 Nov 30,19948057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19948057/,Background:Despite the significant progress made in colon cancer chemotherapy， advanced disease remains largely incurable and novel efficacious chemotherapies are urgently needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) represent a novel class of agents which have demonstrated promising preclinical activity and are undergoing clinical evaluation in colon cancer. The goal of this study was to identify genes in colon cancer cells that are differentially regulated by two clinically advanced hydroxamic acid HDACi， vorinostat and LBH589 to provide rationale for novel drug combination partners and identify a core set of HDACi-regulated genes.Methods:HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells were treated with LBH589 or vorinostat and growth inhibition， acetylation status and apoptosis were analyzed in response to treatment using MTS， Western blotting and flow cytometric analyses. In addition， gene expression was analyzed using the Illumina Human-6 V2 BeadChip array and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.Results:Treatment with either vorinostat or LBH589 rapidly induced histone acetylation， cell cycle arrest and inhibited the growth of both HCT116 and HT29 cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the microarray profiling revealed significant similarity in the genes altered in expression following treatment with the two HDACi tested within each cell line. However， analysis of genes that were altered in expression in the HCT116 and HT29 cells revealed cell-line-specific responses to HDACi treatment. In addition a core cassette of 11 genes modulated by both vorinostat and LBH589 were identified in both colon cancer cell lines analyzed.Conclusion:This study identified HDACi-induced alterations in critical genes involved in nucleotide metabolism， angiogenesis， mitosis and cell survival which may represent potential intervention points for novel therapeutic combinations in colon cancer. This information will assist in the identification of novel pathways and targets that are modulated by HDACi， providing much-needed information on HDACi mechanism of action and providing rationale for novel drug combination partners. We identified a core signature of 11 genes which were modulated by both vorinostat and LBH589 in a similar manner in both cell lines. These core genes will assist in the development and validation of a common gene set which may represent a molecular signature of HDAC inhibition in colon cancer.
MST-312 Alters Telomere Dynamics， Gene Expression Profiles and Growth in Human Breast Cancer Cells.,J Nutrigenet Nutrigenomics, 2014,26022559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26022559/,Background:Targeting telomerase is a potential cancer management strategy given that it allows unlimited cellular replication in the majority of cancers. Dysfunctional telomeres are recognized as double-strand breaks. However， the status of DNA repair response pathways following telomerase inhibition is not well understood in human breast cancer cells. Here， we evaluated the effects of MST-312， a chemically modified derivative from tea catechin， epigallocatechin gallate， on telomere dynamics and DNA damage gene expression in breast cancer cells.Methodology:Breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were treated with MST-312， and telomere-telomerase homeostasis， induced DNA damage and gene expression profiling were analyzed.Results:MST-312 decreased telomerase activity and induced telomere dysfunction and growth arrest in breast cancer cells with more profound effects in MDA-MB-231 than in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with these data， the telomere-protective protein TRF2 was downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. MST-312 induced DNA damage at telomeres accompanied by reduced expression of DNA damage-related genes ATM and RAD50. Co-treatment with MST-312 and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitor PJ-34 further enhanced growth reduction as compared to single treatment with MST-312 or PJ-34.Conclusions:Our work demonstrates potential importance for the establishment of antitelomerase cancer therapy using MST-312 along with PARP-1 inhibition in breast cancer therapy.
Gene expression and amplification in breast carcinoma cells with intrinsic and acquired doxorubicin resistance.,Oncogene, 2001 Mar 15,11313874,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11313874/,The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is a major cause of cancer treatment failure. Here the expressions of 4224 genes were analysed for association with intrinsic or acquired doxorubicin (DOX) resistance. A cluster of overexpressed genes related to DOX resistance was observed. Included in this cluster was ABCB1 the P-glycoprotein transporter protein gene and MMP1 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)， indicative of the invasive nature of resistant cells， and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR)， a potential new therapeutic target. Overexpression of genes associated with xenobiotic transformation， cell transformation， cell signalling and lymphocyte activation was also associated with DOX resistance as was estrogen receptor negativity. In all carcinoma cells， compared with HBL100 a putatively normal breast epithelial cell line， a cluster of overexpressed genes was identified which included several keratins， in particular keratins 8 and 18 which are regulated through the ras signalling pathway. Analysis of genomic amplifications and deletions revealed specific genetic alterations common to both intrinsic and acquired DOX resistance including ABCB1， PGY3 (ABCB4) and BAK. The findings shown here indicate new possibilities for the diagnosis of DOX resistance using gene expression， and potential novel therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention.
Fluorescence-expressing viruses allow rapid identification and separation of rare tumor cells in spiked samples of human whole blood.,Surgery, 2009 Sep,19715807,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19715807/,Background:Finding and isolating rare tumor cells in blood allows for diagnosis of disseminated cancer and for molecular profiling to direct the choice of biologic therapy. We explored whether the candidate gene therapy virus NV1066-designed to specifically infect cancer cells and express green fluorescence protein (GFP)-can be used for rapid infection， identification， and isolation of rare circulating tumor cells (CTC) in human whole blood.Methods:Mixtures of human cancer cell lines and human whole blood were exposed to NV1066 or heat-inactivated virus， incubated， and then examined for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) was used to determine the efficiency of virally assisted tumor cell isolation. Sorted cells were subsequently stained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to determine if cells isolated in this way would maintain sufficient cellular integrity for molecular characterization.Results:In our study， there was 100% specificity for detection of cancer cells. Detection was consistent even at the highest dilution tested (10 cancer cells in 10 ml whole blood). The processing involved simple incubation without the technical demands of immunohistochemistry. FACS allowed for rapid isolation of GFP-expressing cells. Cells isolated by this method can subsequently undergo molecular characterization.Conclusion:Oncolytic herpes simplex virus mediated green fluorescence in combination with FACS is a novel technique for the identification and isolation of cancer cells in an experimental model of blood-borne metastases. This procedure is a promising method for improving our diagnosis， staging， and molecular profiling of cancer.
Expression Profiling Identified TRPM7 and HER2 as Potential Targets for the Combined Treatment of Cancer Cells.,Cells, 2024 Oct 31,39513908,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39513908/,TRPM7 is a divalent cation-permeable channel that is highly active in cancer cells. The pharmacological inhibitors of TRPM7 have been shown to suppress the proliferation of tumor cells， highlighting TRPM7 as a new anticancer drug target. However， the potential benefit of combining TRPM7 inhibitors with conventional anticancer therapies remains unexplored. Here， we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling of human leukemia HAP1 cells to examine cellular responses caused by the application of NS8593， the potent inhibitor of the TRPM7 channel， in comparison with two independent knockout mutations in theTRPM7gene introduced by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. This analysis revealed thatTRPM7regulates the expression levels of several transcripts， includingHER2(ERBB2). Consequently， we examined theTRPM7/HER2axis in several non-hematopoietic cells to show that TRPM7 affects the expression of HER2 protein in a Zn2+-dependent fashion. Moreover， we found that co-administration of pharmacological inhibitors of HER2 and TRPM7 elicited a synergistic antiproliferative effect on HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells but not on HER2-deficient MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Hence， our study proposes a new combinatorial strategy for treating HER2-positive breast cancer cells.Keywords:CP724714; ERBB2; HER2; NS8593; TRP channels; breast cancer; zinc.
Identification of MMP1 as a potential gene conferring erlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer based on bioinformatics analyses.,Hereditas, 2020 Jul 23,32703314,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32703314/,Background:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer with high morbidity and poor prognosis. Erlotinib， an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)， has been clinically applied for NSCLC treatment. Nevertheless， the erlotinib acquired resistance of NSCLC occurs inevitably in recent years.Methods:Through analyzing two microarray datasets， erlotinib resistant NSCLC cells microarray (GSE80344) and NSCLC tissue microarray (GSE19188)， the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened via R language. DEGs were then functionally annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis， which up-regulated more than 2-folds in both datasets were further functionally analyzed by Oncomine， GeneMANIA， R2， Coremine， and FunRich.Results:We found that matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) may confer the erlotinib therapeutic resistance in NSCLC. MMP1 highly expressed in erlotinib-resistant cells and NSCLC tissues， and it associated with poor overall survival. In addition， MMP1 may be associated with COPS5 and be involve in an increasing transcription factors HOXA9 and PBX1 in erlotinib resistance.Conclusions:Generally， these results demonstrated that MMP1 may play a crucial role in erlotinib resistance in NSCLC， and MMP1 could be a prognostic biomarker for erlotinib treatment.Keywords:Bioinformatics analyses; Erlotinib resistance; MMP1; NSCLC.
Gene expression profile of colon cancer cell lines treated with SN-38.,Chemotherapy, 2010,20185912,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185912/,im:Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the industrial countries. Due to advances regarding the treatments， primarily development of improved surgical methods and the ability to make the earlier diagnosis， the mortality has remained constant during the past decades even though the incidence in fact has increased. To improve chemotherapy and enable personalised treatment， the need of biomarkers is of great significance. In this study， we evaluated the gene expression profiles of the colon cancer cell lines treated with SN-38， the active metabolite of topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.Material and methods:The study included 3 colon cancer cell lines: KM12C， KM12SM and KM12l4a. The 3 cell lines were treated with SN-38， and samples were obtained after 24 and 48 hour treatments. The gene expression analyses were performed using oligonucleotide microarrays comprising of approximately 27，000 spots where the untreated controls were compared to the SN-38-treated samples.Results:Unsupervised clustering clearly distinguished the treated cell lines from the untreated. Supervised analysis identified 3，974 significant genes (p = 0.05) differentiating the treated samples from the untreated， majority of which were down-regulated after treatment. The top-ranked down-regulated genes in the treated cell lines included those related to receptor and kinase activity， signal transduction， apoptosis， RNA processing， protein metabolism and transport， cell cycle and transcription. A smaller number of genes were up-regulated in the cell lines after treatment and included genes involved in apoptosis， transcription， development and differentiation.Conclusions:These results demonstrate that the expression of the genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as RNA， DNA and protein metabolism were affected by SN-38. The impact of certain genes on colorectal cancer development needs to be further evaluated; however， these results could serve as a basis for further studies in order to find targets for irinotecan treatment.
Molecular characterization analysis of PANoptosis-related genes in colorectal cancer based on bioinformatic analysis.,PLoS One, 2024 Aug 26,39186800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39186800/,Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer globally and stands as the second principal contributor to cancer-related fatalities. Recently， emerging research has emphasized the role of pan apoptosis (PANoptosis) in tumor development and anti-tumor therapy. In the course of this investigation， we meticulously identified and conducted a correlation analysis between differentially expressed genes associated with PANoptosis in CRC (CPAN_DEGs) and the proportion of immune cells. Subsequently， we formulated a prognostic score based on the CPAN_DEGs. Further our analysis revealed a noteworthy reduction in UNC5D mRNA expression within HCT116， HT29 and SW480 cells， as validated by qRT-PCR assay. Furthermore， scrutinizing the TCGA database unveiled a distinctive trend wherein individuals with the low UNC5D expression exhibited significantly reduced overall survival compared to their counterparts with the high UNC5D levels. The drug susceptibility analysis of UNC5D was further performed， which showed that UNC5D was corassociated with the sensitivity of CRC to 6-Thioguanine. The outcomes of our investigation underscore the mechanisms by which PANoptosis influences immune dysregulation as well as prognostic outcome in CRC.
Prediction of in vitro response to interferon-alpha in renal cell carcinoma cell lines.,Cancer Sci, 2007 Apr,17284252,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17284252/,We analyzed the correlation between interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) response and gene expression profiles to predict IFNalpha sensitivity and identified key molecules regulating the IFNalpha response in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. To classify eight RCC cell lines of the SKRC series into three subgroups according to IFNalpha sensitivity， that is， sensitive， resistant and intermediate group， responses to IFNalpha (300-3000 IU/mL) were quantified by WST-1 assay. Microarray， followed by supervised hierarchical clustering analysis， was applied to selected genes according to IFNalpha sensitivity. In order to find alteration of expression profiles induced by IFNalpha， sequential microarray analyses were performed at 3， 6， and 12 h after IFNalpha treatment of RCC cell lines and mRNA expression level was confirmed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. According to the sequential microarray analysis between IFNalpha-sensitive and -resistant line， seven genes were selected as candidates for IFNalpha-sensitivity-related genes in RCC cell lines. Among these seven genes， we further developed a model to predict tumor inhibition with four genes， that is， adipose differentiation-related protein， microphthalmia associated transcription factor， mitochondrial tumor suppressor 1， and troponin T1 using multiple linear regression analysis (coefficient=0.948， P=0.0291) and validated the model using other RCC cell lines including six primary cultured RCC cells. The expression levels of the combined selected genes may provide predictive information on the IFNalpha response in RCC. Furthermore， the IFNalpha response to RCC might be modulated by regulation of the expression level of these molecules.
In vitro transformation of primary human CD34+ cells by AML fusion oncogenes: early gene expression profiling reveals possible drug target in AML.,PLoS One, 2010 Aug 27,20805992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20805992/,Different fusion oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have distinct clinical and laboratory features suggesting different modes of malignant transformation. Here we compare the in vitro effects of representatives of 4 major groups of AML fusion oncogenes on primary human CD34+ cells. As expected from their clinical similarities， MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 had very similar effects in vitro. They both caused erythroid hyperplasia and a clear block in erythroid and myeloid maturation. On the other hand， AML1-ETO and PML-RARA had only modest effects on myeloid and erythroid differentiation. All oncogenes except PML-RARA caused a dramatic increase in long-term proliferation and self-renewal. Gene expression profiling revealed two distinct temporal patterns of gene deregulation. Gene deregulation by MLL-AF9 and NUP98-HOXA9 peaked 3 days after transduction. In contrast， the vast majority of gene deregulation by AML1-ETO and PML-RARA occurred within 6 hours， followed by a dramatic drop in the numbers of deregulated genes. Interestingly， the p53 inhibitor MDM2 was upregulated by AML1-ETO at 6 hours. Nutlin-3， an inhibitor of the interaction between MDM2 and p53， specifically inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of primary human CD34+ cells transduced with AML1-ETO， suggesting that MDM2 upregulation plays a role in cell transformation by AML1-ETO. These data show that differences among AML fusion oncogenes can be recapitulated in vitro using primary human CD34+ cells and that early gene expression profiling in these cells can reveal potential drug targets in AML.

Regulatory characterisation of the schizophrenia-associated CACNA1C proximal promoter and the potential role for the transcription factor EZH2 in schizophrenia aetiology.,Schizophr Res, 2018 Sep,29501388,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501388/,Genomic wide association studies identified the CACNA1C locus as genetically associated with both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. CACNA1C encodes Cav1.2， one of four subunits of L-type voltage gated calcium channels. Variation resides in non-coding regions of CACNA1C which interact with the promoter and are validated expression quantitative trait loci. Using reporter gene constructs we demonstrate the CACNA1C promoter is a major mediator of inducible regulation of CACNA1C activity in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to lithium and cocaine modulated both the endogenous CACNA1C gene and the promoter in reporter gene constructs. Deletion analysis of the promoter demonstrated the actions of both lithium and cocaine were mediated by the proximal promoter. Initial interrogation of ENCODE ChIP-seq data over the CACNA1C promoter indicated binding of the transcription factor 'Enhancer of zeste homolog 2' (EZH2)， which was consistent with our data that overexpression of EZH2 repressed CACNA1C promoter reporter gene expression. Array data from the Human Brain Transcriptome demonstrated that EZH2 was highly expressed across the developing brain， but subsequently maintained at low levels after birth and adulthood. RNA-seq data obtained from PD_NGSAtlas， a reference database for epigenomic and transcriptomic data for psychiatric disorders， demonstrated a 3-fold increase in EZH2 expression in the anterior cingulate cortex of individuals with schizophrenia compared to controls. We propose that EZH2 may contribute to schizophrenia risk at two distinct time points either through disruption in development leading to neurodevelopmental changes， or through anomalous reactivation of expression in the adult brain.Keywords:Development; Epigenetics; Gene expression; Genetics; Transcriptomics.

The Profile of MicroRNA Expression and Potential Role in the Regulation of Drug-Resistant Genes in Cisplatin- and Paclitaxel-Resistant Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines.,Int J Mol Sci, 2022 Jan 4,35008952,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008952/,Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The high mortality results from late diagnosis and the development of drug resistance. Drug resistance results from changes in the expression of different drug-resistance genes that may be regulated miRNA. The main aim of our study was to detect changes in miRNA expression levels in two cisplatin (CIS) and two paclitaxel (PAC)-resistant variants of the A2780 drug-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line-by miRNA microarray. The next goal was to identify miRNAs responsible for the regulation of drug-resistance genes. We observed changes in the expression of 46 miRNA that may be related to drug resistance. The overexpression of miR-125b-5p， miR-99a-5p， miR-296-3p， and miR-887-3p and downregulation of miR-218-5p， miR-221-3p， and miR-222-3p was observed in both CIS-resistant cell lines. In both PAC-resistant cell lines， we observed the upregulation of miR-221-3p， miR-222-3p， and miR-4485， and decreased expression of miR-551b-3p， miR-551b-5p， and miR-218-5p. Analysis of targets suggest that expression of important drug-resistant genes like protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type K (PTPRK)， receptor tyrosine kinase-EPHA7， Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A)， or the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 gene (ABCB1) can be regulated by miRNA.Keywords:drug-resistant genes; first line chemotherapy; microRNA; ovarian cancer.
Anti-proliferation effects of interferon-gamma on gastric cancer cells.,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2013,24175851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24175851/,IFN-γ plays an indirect anti-cancer role through the immune system but may have direct negative effects on cancer cells. It regulates the viability of gastric cancer cells， so we examined whether it affects their proliferation and how that might be brought about. We exposed AGS， HGC-27 and GES-1 gastric cancer cell lines to IFN-γ and found significantly reduced colony formation ability. Flow cytometry revealed no effect of IFN-γ on apoptosis of cell lines and no effect on cell aging as assessed by β-gal staining. Microarray assay revealed that IFN-γ changed the mRNA expression of genes related to the cell cycle and cell proliferation and migration， as well as chemokines and chemokine receptors， and immunity-related genes. Finally， flow cytometry revealed that IFN-γ arrested the cells in the G1/S phase. IFN-γ may slow proliferation of some gastric cancer cells by affecting the cell cycle to play a negative role in the development of gastric cancer.
Profile of stress and toxicity gene expression in human hepatic cells treated with Efavirenz.,Antiviral Res, 2012 Jun,22554935,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22554935/,Hepatic toxicity and metabolic disorders are major adverse effects elicited during the pharmacological treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Efavirenz (EFV)， the most widely used non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)， has been associated with these events， with recent studies implicating it in stress responses involving mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in human hepatic cells. To expand these findings， we analyzed the influence of EFV on the expression profile of selected stress and toxicity genes in these cells. Significant up-regulation was observed with Cytochrome P450， family 1， subfamily A， polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1)， which indicated metabolic stress. Several genes directly related to oxidative stress and damage exhibited increased expression， including Methalothionein 2A (MT2A)， Heat shock 70kDa protein 6 (HSPA6)， Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3). In addition， Early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) was enhanced， whereas mRNA levels of the inflammatory genes Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) and Serpin peptidase inhibitor (nexin， plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1)， member 1 (SERPINE1) decreased and increased， respectively. This profile of gene expression supports previous data demonstrating altered mitochondrial function and presence of oxidative stress/damage in EFV-treated hepatic cells， and may be of relevance in the search for molecular targets with therapeutic potential to be employed in the prevention， diagnosis and treatment of the hepatic toxicity associated with HIV therapy.
Rigosertib induces cell death of a myelodysplastic syndrome-derived cell line by DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest.,Cancer Sci, 2015 Mar,25580850,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25580850/," multi-kinase inhibitor， rigosertib (ON 01910.Na) has recently been highlighted as a novel type of anti-cancer agent for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)， but its action mechanisms remain to be clarified. We investigated the in vitro effects of rigosertib on an MDS-derived cell line MDS-L and a myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Rigosertib suppressed the proliferation of both HL-60 and MDS-L cells and induced apoptosis by inhibition of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. As the effects on cell cycle， rigosertib treatment promoted the phosphorylation of histone H2AX and led to the DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. In addition， an immunofluorescence staining study demonstrated the abnormal localization of aurora A kinase， suggesting that rigosertib causes perturbation of spindle assembly and deregulated mitotic patterns towards cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also found that rigosertib exerted growth inhibitory effects on two lymphoid cell lines， Jurkat and Ramos. We further examined the molecular pathways influenced by rigosertib from the gene expression profiling data of MDS-L cells and found a possible involvement of rigosertib treatment in the upregulation of the genes related to microtubule kinetics and the downregulation of the mRNA degradation system. The gene set enrichment analysis showed the suppression of ""nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)"" as the most significantly affected gene set. These data provide a new aspect and a potential utility of rigosertib for the treatment of refractory hematopoietic malignancies.Keywords:G2/M arrest; myelodysplastic syndromes; nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; rigosertib; synthetic anticancer agent."
p53 overexpression increases chemosensitivity in multidrug-resistant osteosarcoma cell lines.,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol, 2016 Feb,26698867,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26698867/,Purpose:Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of osteosarcoma with chemotherapy. Effectiveness of cancer therapy correlates with the ability to induce a p53-dependent apoptotic response. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in 22 % of osteosarcomas. While impaired p53 has been implicated in the oncogenesis of osteosarcoma， it is unclear whether overexpression of wild-type p53 can increase chemosensitivity in MDR osteosarcoma cells.Methods:We transfected a plasmid encoding the wild-type p53 gene to MDR osteosarcoma cell lines， which have different p53 statuses， U-2OSR2 with wild-type p53 (Wt-p53) and KHOSR2 with mutant p53 (Mt-p53)， and determined the effect of p53 overexpression on chemosensitivities.Results:Both of the U-2OSR2 and KHOSR2 cell lines displayed similar trends in p53-induced drug sensitivities. However， it seems that the impact of p53 overexpression is different based on the differential intrinsic p53 status in these cell lines. In the KHOSR2 cell line (Mt-p53)， overexpression of p53 up-regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic protein p21 and Bax， while in the U-2OSR2 cell line (Wt-p53)， overexpression of p53 down-regulates IGF-1r expression significantly.Conclusions:These results demonstrated that transfection of wild-type p53 increases chemosensitivity either through inhibiting IGF-1r or through increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins p21 and Bax in human MDR osteosarcoma cell lines.Keywords:Apoptosis; MDR; Osteosarcoma; p53.
MicroRNA 506 regulates expression of PPAR alpha in hydroxycamptothecin-resistant human colon cancer cells.,FEBS Lett, 2011 Nov 16,22036718,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22036718/,Chemotherapeutic drug resistance remains a major obstacle to the successful treatment of colon cancer. Here， we show that 77 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in SW1116/HCPT versus SW1116， and over-expressed miR-506 in SW1116/HCPT cells was validated. Then it was indicated that PPARα is a common target of miR-506 by using a luciferase reporter assay. Our results also demonstrated that cytotoxic ability of HCPT requires the concomitant presence of PPARα， and that loss of PPARα expression imparts resistance to HCPTs anti-tumor effects. All together， our studies indicate that miR-506 over-expression in established HCPT-resistant colon cancer cell line confers resistance to HCPT by inhibiting PPARα expression， then providing a rationale for the development of miRNA-based strategies for reversing resistance in HCPT-resistant colon cancer cells.
A gene expression database for the molecular pharmacology of cancer.,Nat Genet, 2000 Mar,10700175,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10700175/,We used cDNA microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in 60 human cancer cell lines used in a drug discovery screen by the National Cancer Institute. Using these data， we linked bioinformatics and chemoinformatics by correlating gene expression and drug activity patterns in the NCI60 lines. Clustering the cell lines on the basis of gene expression yielded relationships very different from those obtained by clustering the cell lines on the basis of their response to drugs. Gene-drug relationships for the clinical agents 5-fluorouracil and L-asparaginase exemplify how variations in the transcript levels of particular genes relate to mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance. This is the first study to integrate large databases on gene expression and molecular pharmacology.
MicroRNA 196B regulates FAS-mediated apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells.,Oncotarget, 2015 Feb 20,25605245,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25605245/,Using miRNA microarray analysis， we identified 31 miRNAs that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in colon cancer tissues. We chose MIR196B， which was specifically up-regulated in colon cancer， for further study. We identified 18 putative MIR196B target genes by comparing between the mRNAs down-regulated in MIR196B-overexpressed cells and the assumed MIR196B target genes predicted by public bioinformatics tools. The association between MIR196B and FAS was verified in this study. FAS expression was constitutively elevated in normal human colorectal tissues. However， its expression was often reduced in human colorectal cancer. The decrease in FAS expression could be responsible for the reduction of apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. In colorectal cancer tissue， we showed that MIR196B up-regulation was mutually followed by down regulation of FAS expression. We also showed that MIR196B directly repressed FAS expression in colorectal cells. Furthermore， anti-MIR196B up-regulated FAS expression and increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that the up-regulation of MIR196B modulates apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells by partially repressing FAS expression and that anti-MIR196B could be a potential candidate as an anti-cancer drug in colorectal cancer therapy.
Comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted role of ITGAV in digestive system cancer progression and immune infiltration.,Front Immunol, 2025 Feb 13,40018050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40018050/,Background:Digestive system cancers are among the most common malignancies， exhibiting consistently high incidence and mortality rates， yet effective detection and treatment targets remain limited. Integrin αv (ITGAV， CD51) is a significant member of the integrin family， widely recognized for its role in mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix， as well as intracellular signaling. In recent years， ITGAV has been found to have significantly elevated expression in multiple tumors， such as prostate cancer， breast cancer， and osteosarcoma， and was considered to be a key component in various stages of tumor progression. However， no systematic digestive system cancer analysis has been conducted to explore its function in prognosis， diagnosis， and immunology.Methods:Transcriptome sequencing and clinical data of samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)， Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)， Human Protein Atlas (HPA)， cBioPortal， TIMER and TISIDB databases. Bioinformatics methods were employed to investigate the potential oncogenicity of ITGAV， focusing specifically on the analysis of its prognosis， diagnostic value， and immune infiltration level of ITGAV in digestive system cancers. In addition， GO， KEGG， and PPI network analysis revealed the biological functions and related signaling pathways related to ITGAV. Finally， the role of ITGAV in regulating cancer progression was experimentally verified using hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer as examples.Results:We found that ITGAV was highly expressed in multiple digestive system cancers. In addition， high expression of ITGAV was closely associated with poor prognosis and showed potential for early diagnosis. Enrichment of pathways related to extracellular matrix organizing processes and tumor migratory movements was identified.In vitro， results showed that the knockdown of ITGAV significantly inhibited the migratory movement ability of hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer cells， while its overexpression significantly promoted the migration of the above cells. Finally， immunoassays showed a significant correlation between ITGAV expression and the infiltration level of various immune cells， further clarifying the critical role of ITGAV in the tumor immune microenvironment.Conclusion:Our results elucidated the importance of ITGAV in the prognostic assessment， early diagnosis， and targeted immunotherapy of digestive system cancers， and revealed its multifaceted role in regulating cancer progression.Keywords:ITGAV; diagnosis; digestive system cancers; immunology; migration.
Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA): a method for identifying associations between variable sets.,Bioinformatics, 2015 Jan 1,25183485,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25183485/,Motivation:Often during the analysis of biological data， it is of importance to interpret the correlation structure that exists between variables. Such correlations may reveal patterns of co-regulation that are indicative of biochemical pathways or common mechanisms of response to a related set of treatments. However， analyses of correlations are usually conducted by either subjective interpretation of the univariate covariance matrix or by applying multivariate modeling techniques， which do not take prior biological knowledge into account. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a simple method for objectively deciding whether a set of variables of known or suspected biological relevance， such as a gene set or pathway， is more prevalent in a set of variables of interest than we expect by chance. However， ORA is usually applied to a set of variables differentiating a single experimental variable and does not take into account correlations.Results:Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA) is a novel combination of ORA and correlation analysis that provides a means to test whether more associations exist between two specific groups of variables than expected by chance. The method is exemplified by application to drug sensitivity and microRNA expression data from a panel of cancer cell lines (NCI60). ORCA highlighted a previously reported correlation between sensitivity to alkylating anticancer agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. We also used this approach to validate microRNA clusters predicted by mRNA correlations. These observations suggest that ORCA has the potential to reveal novel insights from these data， which are not readily apparent using classical ORA.Availability and implementation:The R code of the method is available at https://github.com/ORCABioinfo/ORCAcode.
Upregulation of ZNRD1 enhances cisplatin resistance in human esophageal cancer cells by regulation of ERCC1 and Bcl-2.,Tumour Biol, 2008,18645262,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18645262/,Background/aims:The precise mechanism of the zinc ribbon domain-containing-1 (ZNRD1) gene on cisplatin resistance remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the gene expression profile and explore the role of these genes in ZNRD1-induced cisplatin resistance in esophageal cancer cells.Methods:An expression vector with ZNRD1 was transfected into the EC109 cells， and then cDNA microarray analysis was performed to identify the gene expression profile. The sensitivity of transfected EC109 cells to cisplatin was evaluated using the MTT assay. RT-PCR and Western blots were performed to validate the differential expression of genes identified by cDNA microarray analysis.Results:We identified 16 genes with significantly different expression levels between the transfected and control cells. The tolerance of EC109 cells to cisplatin was significantly enhanced by the upregulation of ZNRD1. Furthermore， the expression of excision repair cross-complementing-1 (ERCC1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) was significantly upregulated.Conclusion:The ZNRD1 gene might be involved in the cisplatin resistance of EC109 cells by regulating the expression of ERCC1 and Bcl-2.
Identification of proteasomal catalytic subunit PSMA6 as a therapeutic target for lung cancer.,Cancer Sci, 2017 Apr,28165654,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28165654/,To identify potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer， we performed semi-genome-wide shRNA screening combined with the utilization of genome-wide expression and copy number data. shRNA screening targeting 5043 genes in NCI-H460 identified 51 genes as candidates. Pathway analysis revealed that the 51 genes were enriched for the five pathways， including ribosome， proteasome， RNA polymerase， pyrimidine metabolism and spliceosome pathways. We focused on the proteasome pathway that involved six candidate genes because its activation has been demonstrated in diverse human malignancies， including lung cancer. Microarray expression and array CGH data showed that PSMA6， a proteasomal subunit of a 20S catalytic core complex， was highly expressed in lung cancer cell lines， with recurrent gene amplifications in some cases. Therefore， we further examined the roles of PSMA6 in lung cancer. Silencing of PSMA6 induced apoptosis or G2/M cell cycle arrest in cancer cell lines but not in an immortalized normal lung cell line. These results suggested that PSMA6 serves as an attractive target with a high therapeutic index for lung cancer.Keywords:Apoptosis; lung neoplasms; proteasome endopeptidase complex; small interfering RNA; spliceosomes.
Fatty acid binding protein 7 may be a marker and therapeutic targets in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,BMC Cancer, 2018 Nov 15,30442117,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30442117/,Background:To identify potential therapeutic target in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)， we performed a transcriptome analysis. Our analysis showed that fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) has the highest mean differential overexpression in ccRCC compared to normal kidney. We aimed to investigate the significance of FABP7 in ccRCC.Methods:Immunohistochemical staining for 40 advanced ccRCC cases was performed to investigate correlation between clinicopathological parameters and FABP7. They were composed of 40-83 years old cases with 33 male， 22 cases with pT ≥ 3， 19 cases with M1， and 16 cases with grade 3. The effect of gene knockdown was analysed by a cell viability assay and invasion assay in FABP7-overexpressing cell lines (SKRC7 and SKRC10).Results:Our immunohistochemical analysis showed that higher FABP7 expression significantly correlated with distant metastasis and poor cancer-specific survival (CSS; both p < 0.05). Functional suppression of FABP7 significantly inhibited SKRC10 cell growth (p < 0.05) and resulted in a significant reduction of the invasive potential (p < 0.01)， but did not cause growth inhibition of SKRC7 cells. We found that The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) database shows FABP6 and 7 as equally overexpressed in the FABP family. Functional suppression of fatty acid binding protein 6 (FABP6) resulted in significant growth inhibition of SKRC7 cells (p < 0.005).Conclusions:Functional suppression of FABP7 significantly reduced cell viability and invasive potential in a ccRCC cell line. FABP7 may play a role in progression in some metastatic ccRCCs. The suppressed function may be compensated by another FABP family member.Keywords:Clear cell renal cell carcinoma; Fatty acid binding protein 6; Fatty acid binding protein 7; Prognostic marker; Therapeutic target.
Waterpipe smoke condensate influences epithelial to mesenchymal transition and interferes with the cytotoxic immune response in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.,Oncol Rep, 2021 Mar,33469682,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469682/,Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WPS) continues to spread globally and presents serious health hazards. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of treatment with WPS condensate (WPSC) on lung cell proliferation and plasticity as well as tumor cell recognition and killing by natural killer (NK) cells using cytotoxicity assays. The results indicated that exposure of normal and cancer lung cell lines to WPSC resulted in a decrease in their in vitro growth in a dose-dependent manner and it induced tumor senescence. In addition， WPSC selectively caused DNA damage as revealed by an increase in γH2AX and 53BP1 in tumor lung cells. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms altered by WPSC， we conducted a global comprehensive transcriptome analysis of WPSC-treated tumor cells. Data analysis identified an expression profile of genes that best distinguished treated and non-treated cells involving several pathways. Of these pathways， we focused on those involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. Results showed that WPSC induced an increase in SNAI2 expression associated with EMT， ACTA2 and SERPINE2 were involved in invasion and CD44 was associated with stemness. Furthermore， WPSC exposure increased the expression of inflammatory response genes including CASP1， IL1B， IL6 and CCL2. While immune synapse formation between NK and WPSC-treated lung cancer target cells was not affected， the capacity of NK cells to kill these target cells was reduced. The data reported in the present study are， to the best of our knowledge， the first in vitro demonstration of WPSC effects on lung cellular parameters providing evidence of its potential involvement in tumor physiology and development.Keywords:waterpipe smoke; lung cancer; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; cancer stem cells; inflammation; tumor microenvironment; natural killer-mediated cytotoxicity.
Global analysis of RNA expression profile in human vascular cells treated with statins.,J Atheroscler Thromb, 2004,15153665,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15153665/,In addition to a lipid-lowering effect， 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have an effect on the expression levels of many genes. In order to elucidate the range of this effect as comprehensively as possible， we investigated the changes in gene expression profiles brought about by atorvastatin or pitavastatin in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)， cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) and cultured human hepatocarcinoma Hep G2 cells by means of DNA microarrays. Among the 6146 genes in the array， statins affected the expression levels of genes involved in coagulation， vascular constriction and cell growth in a cell-type specific manner. In HUVEC， they induced integrin beta4 and thrombomodulin profoundly， and profoundly suppressed pentraxin 3 both at 8 and 24 hours. In HCASMC， the statins induced thrombomodulin and urokinase inhibitor， and potently suppressed the cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 and cyclin B. Many genes related to the cell cycle and/or growth were also regulated in HUVEC and HCASMC by the statins. These results indicate that many aspects of the pleiotropic effect can be mediated by transcriptional control by statins. Genes newly identified by this study may be useful in statin therapy.
Molecular profiling of docetaxel cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells: uncoupling of aberrant mitosis and apoptosis.,Oncogene, 2007 May 3,17099726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17099726/,mong microtubule-targeting agents， docetaxel has received recent interest owing to its good therapeutic index. Clinical trials have underlined its potential for the treatment of advanced breast cancer， although little is known about its molecular mode of action in this context. We characterized the molecular changes induced by docetaxel in two well-known human breast carcinoma cell lines. Two mechanisms of action according to drug concentration were suggested by a biphasic sensitivity curve， and were further validated by cell morphology， cell cycle and cell death changes. Two to four nanomolar docetaxel induced aberrant mitosis followed by late necrosis， and 100 nM docetaxel induced mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis. Passing through mitosis phase was a requirement for hypodiploidy to occur， as shown by functional studies in synchronized cells and by combining docetaxel with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Transcriptional profiling showed differences according to cell line and docetaxel concentration， with cell cycle， cell death and structural genes commonly regulated in both cell lines. Although p53 targets were mainly induced with low concentration of drug in MCF7 cells， its relevance in the dual mechanism of docetaxel cytotoxicity was ruled out by using an isogenic shp53 cell line. Many of the genes shown in this study may contribute to the dual mechanism by which docetaxel inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells at different concentrations. These findings provide a basis for rationally enhancing docetaxel therapy， considering lower concentrations， and better drug combinations.
In-Silico Evaluation of Genetic Alterations in Ovarian Carcinoma and Therapeutic Efficacy of NSC777201， as a Novel Multi-Target Agent for TTK， NEK2， and CDK1.,Int J Mol Sci, 2021 May 31,34072728,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34072728/,Ovarian cancer is often detected at the advanced stages at the time of initial diagnosis. Early-stage diagnosis is difficult due to its asymptomatic nature， where less than 30% of 5-year survival has been noticed. The underlying molecular events associated with the disease's pathogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated. Thus， the identification of prognostic biomarkers as well as developing novel therapeutic agents for targeting these markers become relevant. Herein， we identified 264 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common in four ovarian cancer datasets (GSE14407， GSE18520， GSE26712， GSE54388)， respectively. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) interaction network with the overexpressed genes (72 genes) and performed gene enrichment analysis. In the PPI networks， three proteins; TTK Protein Kinase (TTK)， NIMA Related Kinase 2 (NEK2)， and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1) with higher node degrees were further evaluated as therapeutic targets for our novel multi-target small molecule NSC777201. We found that the upregulated DEGs were enriched in KEGG and gene ontologies associated with ovarian cancer progression， female gamete association， otic vesicle development， regulation of chromosome segregation， and therapeutic failure. In addition to the PPI network， ingenuity pathway analysis also implicate TTK， NEK2， and CDK1 in the elevated salvage pyrimidine and pyridoxal pathways in ovarian cancer. The TTK， NEK2， and CDK1 are over-expressed， demonstrating a high frequency of genetic alterations， and are associated with poor prognosis of ovarian cancer cohorts. Interestingly， NSC777201 demonstrated anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activities (GI50= 1.6 µM~1.82 µM and TGI50= 3.5 µM~3.63 µM) against the NCI panels of ovarian cancer cell lines and exhibited a robust interaction with stronger affinities for TTK， NEK2， and CDK1， than do the standard drug， paclitaxel. NSC777201 displayed desirable properties of a drug-like candidate and thus could be considered as a novel small molecule for treating ovarian carcinoma.Keywords:bioinformatics; drug resistance; genetic alterations; ovarian carcinoma; prognostic gene signature; protein-ligand interactions; target-based structure discovery.
Integrative analysis of m7G methylation-associated genes prognostic signature with immunotherapy and identification of LARP1 as a key oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,Front Immunol, 2025 Feb 13,40018039,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40018039/,Background:N7-methylguanosine (m7G) methylation is an RNA modification associated with cancer progression， but its specific role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear.Methods:This study analyzed the differential expression of m7G-related genes (m7GRGs) in HNSCC using the TCGA-HNSCC dataset， identifying key pathways associated with the cell cycle， DNA replication， and focal adhesion. A LASSO-Cox regression model was constructed based on four m7GRGs (EIF3D， EIF1， LARP1， and METTL1) and validated with GEO datasets and clinical samples. Further validation of gene upregulation in HNSCC tissues was conducted using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry， while the role of LARP1 in HNSCC cells was assessed via knockout experiments.Results:The constructed model demonstrated strong predictive performance， with the risk score significantly correlating with prognosis， immune infiltration， and drug sensitivity. An external dataset and clinical specimens further confirmed the model's predictive accuracy for immunotherapy response. Additionally， two regulatory axes-LINC00707/hsa-miR-30b-5p/LARP1 and SNHG16/hsa-miR-30b-5p/LARP1-were identified. LARP1 knockout experiments revealed that suppressing LARP1 markedly inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation， migration， and invasion.Conclusion:The m7GRG-based prognostic model developed in this study holds strong clinical potential for predicting prognosis and therapeutic responses in HNSCC. The identification of LARP1 and its related regulatory pathways offers new avenues for targeted therapy in HNSCC.Keywords:N7-methylguanosine; ceRNA regulatory network; drug sensitivity; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; immunotherapy response; prognostic signature.
Purification and Functional Characterization of the Effects on Cell Signaling of Mytilectin: A Novel β-Trefoil Lectin from Marine Mussels.,Methods Mol Biol, 2020,32306329,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32306329/,"In the 2010s， a novel lectin family with β-trefoil folding has been identified in marine mussels from the family Mytilidae (phylum Mollusca). ""MytiLec-1，"" the lectin described in this chapter， was the first member of this family to be isolated and characterized from the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis， a commercially and ecologically important species， spread in marine coastal areas worldwide. MytiLec-1 bound to the sugar moiety of globotriose (Gb3: Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc)， an α-galactoside， leading to apoptosis of Gb3-expressing Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Although the primary structure of MytiLec-1 was quite unusual， its three-dimensional structure was arranged as a β-trefoil fold， which is the typical architecture of ""Ricin B chain (or R)-type"" lectins， which are found in a broad range of organisms. To date， MytiLec-1-like lectins have been exclusively found in a few species of the mollusk family Mytilidae (M. galloprovincialis， M. trossulus， M. californianus， and Crenomytilus grayanus) and in the phylum Brachiopoda. Transcriptome data revealed the presence of different structural forms of mytilectin in mussels， which included prototype and chimera-type proteins. The primary sequence of these lectins did not match any previously described known protein family， leading to their assignment to the new ""mytilectin family."" We here report the method of purification of this lectin and describe its use in cell biology.Keywords:Apoptosis; Caspase; MAPK family; MytiLec-1; Mytilectin family; Mytilidae; Signal transduction; α-Galactoside."
Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with human platelet lysates for pathogen-safe xeno-free expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells.,Cytotherapy, 2020 Aug,32536505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32536505/,Background aims:Human platelet lysate can replace fetal bovine serum (FBS) for xeno-free ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)， but pooling of platelet concentrates (PCs) increases risks of pathogen transmission. We evaluated the feasibility of performing nanofiltration of platelet lysates and determined the impact on expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs.Methods:Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP+) and 35% plasma， and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v/v)， filtered and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35- and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition， removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs) and MSC expansion were evaluated.Results:Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was >3 log values. Expansion， proliferation， membrane markers， differentiation potential and immunosuppressive properties of cells in nanofiltered media were consistently better than those expanded in FBS-supplemented media. Compared with FBS， chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media， and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages.Conclusions:Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates， including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs， is technically feasible. These data support the possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media for clinical-grade propagation of human cells.Keywords:HPL; human platelet lysates; mesenchymal stromal cells; nanofiltration; prion; virus.
Inflammatory conditions affect gene expression and function of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells.,Clin Exp Immunol, 2010 Dec,20846162,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20846162/,There is emerging interest in the application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases， graft-versus-host disease and allograft rejection. It is， however， unknown how inflammatory conditions affect phenotype and function of MSC. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) were cultured with alloactivated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (mixed lymphocyte reaction: MLR)， with proinflammatory cytokines [interferon (IFN)-γ， tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6] or under control conditions， and their full genome expression and function examined. Proinflammatory cytokines mainly increased indoleamine-2，3-dioxygenase expression， whereas ASC cultured with MLR showed increased expression of COX-2， involved in prostaglandin E(2) production. Both conditions had a stimulatory， but differential， effect on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines， while the expression of fibrotic factors was decreased only in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Functional analysis demonstrated that inflammatory conditions affected morphology and proliferation of ASC， while their differentiation capacity and production of trophic factors was unaffected. The immunosuppressive capacity of ASC was enhanced strongly under inflammatory conditions. In conclusion， ASC showed enhanced immunosuppressive capacity under inflammatory conditions， while their differentiation capacity was preserved. Therefore， in vitro preconditioning provides ASC with improved properties for immediate clinical immune therapy.
Comparison of gene expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells after treatment with bicalutamide or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.,Urol Int, 2010,20215827,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20215827/,Introduction:Androgen deprivation is the preferred treatment for disseminated prostate cancer. However， it mostly leads to the development of incurable androgen-independent disease. The aim of the present study was to compare gene expression changes that occur after treatment with either the antiandrogen bicalutamide or the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors finasteride (MK906) and MK386.Materials and methods:LNCaP cells of low passages were treated with MK906 and MK386 at 5 microM each or with bicalutamide at 10 microM for 48 h. In these cultures we analyzed the expression of 22，500 transcripts on the Affymetrix Human U133+ 2.0 GeneChip platform. Gene expression was verified by real-time quantitative Taqman PCR.Results:Our studies revealed 312 differentially regulated genes upon bicalutamide treatment and 68 differentially regulated genes upon treatment with the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. There were 35 genes equally regulated by both drugs. This subset of genes included those with the highest fold change in both treatment groups. In the subset KlK2， TMPRSS2， TRGC2， PMEPA1 and TM4SF1 were downregulated， whereas EGR1， DDC and OPRK1 were upregulated.Conclusions:A cohort of interesting genes that are differentially expressed after androgen withdrawal could be found in this study. Investigation into these genes could contribute to a better understanding of antiandrogen treatment and development of androgen-independent prostate cancer.
Prediction of the mechanisms of Xiaoai Jiedu Recipe in the treatment of breast cancer: A comprehensive approach study with experimental validation.,J Ethnopharmacol, 2020 Apr 24,31981747,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31981747/,Ethnopharmacological relevance:Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds a great promise for preventing complex chronic diseases through a holistic way. Certain Chinese medicine formulae from TCM are effective for treating and preventing cancer in clinical practice. Xiaoai Jiedu Recipe (XJR) is a Chinese medicine formula that has been used to treat breast cancer (BC). However， its active ingredients and therapeutic mechanisms on tumor are unclear. Therefore， further investigation is necessary.Aim of the study:This study aims to elucidate the active compounds of XJR and its molecular mechanisms for the treatment of BC.Materials and methods:A comprehensive approach was used to clarify the pharmacodynamic basis of XJR and its pharmacological mechanism， including the acquisition of differentially expressed genes of BC， screening of active ingredients and their targets， construction of complex internetwork between drugs and diseases， and analysis of the key subnetwork. Finally， these results were validated by in vitro experiments and comparison with literature reviews.Results:By using bioinformatics， 5211 differentially expressed genes of BC were identified， more than half of them had been reported in previous studies. By using network analysis， 113 potential bioactive compounds in the ten component herbs of XJR and 157 BC-related targets were identified， which were significantly enriched in 85 pathways and 1321 GO terms. The in vitro studies showed that quercetin and ursolic acid， the active components of XJR， could effectively inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells， and the combination of the two components could significantly decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential and suppress the activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway， thus inducing apoptosis of cancer cells.Conclusions:XJR played an important role in anti-BC through multi-component， multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms， in which quercetin and ursolic acid may be the key active components. The anticancer effect of multi-component application was better than that of a single component. This study not only deepened our understanding of the role of TCM in the prevention and treatment of diseases， but also provided a reference for the in-depth research， development and application of the ancient medicine.Keywords:Bioinformatics; Network pharmacology; Quercetin; Traditional Chinese medicine; Ursolic acid; Xiaoai Jiedu Recipe.
Bioinformatics analysis to identify breast cancer-related potential targets and candidate small molecule drugs.,Mutat Res, 2023 Jul-Dec,37437506,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437506/,Objective:The purpose of this study is to identify potential targets associated with breast cancer and screen potential small molecule drugs using bioinformatics analysis.Methods:DEGs analysis of breast cancer tissues and normal breast tissues was performed using R language limma analysis on the GSE42568 and GSE205185 datasets. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted on the intersecting DEGs. The STRING analysis platform was used to construct a PPI network， and the top 10 core nodes were identified using Cytoscape software. QuartataWeb was utilized to build a target-drug interaction network and identify potential drugs. Cell survival and proliferation were assessed using CCK8 and colony formation assays. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was conducted to assess protein levels of PLK1， MELK， AURKA， and NEK2.Results:A total of 54 genes were consistently upregulated in both datasets， which were functionally enriched in mitotic cell cycle and cell cycle-related pathways. The 226 downregulated genes were functionally enriched in pathways related to hormone level regulation and negative regulation of cell population proliferation. Ten key genes， namely CDK1， CCNB2， ASPM， AURKA， TPX2， TOP2A， BUB1B， MELK， RRM2， and NEK2 were identified. The potential drug Fostamatinib was predicted to target AURKA， MELK， CDK1， and NEK2. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Fostamatinib inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells， induced cell arrest in the G2/M phase， and down-regulated MELK， AURKA， and NEK2 proteins.Conclusion:In conclusion， Fostamatinib shows promise as a potential drug for the treatment of breast cancer by regulating the cell cycle and inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells.Keywords:Bioinformatics analysis; Breast cancer; Cell cycle; Fostamatinib.
Oral delivery of DNA construct using chitosan nanoparticles to protect the shrimp from white spot syndrome virus (WSSV).,Fish Shellfish Immunol, 2009 Mar,19141321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19141321/,The protective efficacy of oral delivery of a DNA construct containing the VP28 gene of WSSV encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles was investigated in black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). The results showed that significant survival was obtained in WSSV-challenged shrimp at 7， 15 and 30 days post-treatment (relative survival， 85%， 65% and 50%， respectively) whereas 100% mortality was observed in the control shrimp fed with feed containing chitosan/pcDNA 3.1 or chitosan/PBS complex. The ability of the chitosan to form a complex with the pVP28 and to stabilize it from endonuclease degradation was studied by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxicity of chitosan-encapsulated pVP28 was also evaluated by the MTT assay， which showed 90% viability of SISK cells incubated with the pVP28/chitosan complexes. Transcription analysis of the chitosan-encapsulated pVP28 gene in different tissues of DNA-treated shrimp and SISK cell line was confirmed by an RT-PCR reaction. The present study also measured the changes in the level of important immunological parameters such as prophenoloxidase， superoxide dismutase and superoxide anion in hemolymph of chitosan-encapsulated VP28 DNA-treated and controls shrimp. The study also correlated the changes in the level of immunological parameters with the survival percentage and protective efficacy of oral route of DNA construct against WSSV in shrimp.
Toward the defined and xeno-free differentiation of functional human pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells.,Mol Vis, 2011 Feb 22,21364903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21364903/,Purpose:The production of functional retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from human embryonic (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in defined and xeno-free conditions is highly desirable， especially for their use in cell therapy for retinal diseases. In addition， differentiated RPE cells provide an individualized disease model and drug discovery tool. In this study， we report the differentiation of functional RPE-like cells from several hESC lines and one hiPSC line in culture conditions， enabling easy translation to clinical quality cell production under Good Manufacturing Practice regulations.Methods:Pluripotent stem cells were cultured on human fibroblast feeder cells in serum-free medium. The differentiation toward RPE was induced by removing basic fibroblast growth factor and feeder cells from the serum-free conditions. RPE differentiation was also achieved using xeno-free and defined culture conditions. The RPE cell morphology and pigmentation of the cells were analyzed and the expression of genes and proteins characteristic for RPE cells was evaluated. In vitro functionality of the cells was analyzed using ELISA measurements for pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) secretion and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). The integrity of the generated RPE layers was analyzed using transepithelial electric resistance measurements.Results:We generated putative RPE cells with typical pigmented cobblestone-like morphology. The expression of RPE-specific markers was confirmed at the gene and protein level. The differentiated cells were able to phagocytose POS and secrete PEDF characteristic of native RPE cells. In addition， cultured cells formed a polarized epithelium with high integrity and exhibited excellent transepithelial electric resistance values， indicating well established， tight junctions. Moreover， we introduced an improved method to generate functional putative RPE cells without xeno-components under defined conditions.Conclusions:We have developed a progressive differentiation protocol for the production of functional RPE-like cells from hESCs and hiPSCs. Our results demonstrate that putative hESC-RPE and hiPSC-RPE express genes and proteins characteristic for RPE cells， as well as being able to phagocytose POS and secrete PEDF. Furthermore， our results show that RPE-like cells can be differentiated in xeno-free and defined culture conditions， which is mandatory for Good Manufacturing Practice-production of these cells for clinical use.

Transcriptomic analysis of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway reveals the dual role of the c-Jun oncogene in cytotoxicity and the development of resistance in HL-60 leukemia cells in response to arsenic trioxide.,Adv Clin Exp Med, 2017 Dec,29442453,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29442453/,Background:Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a well-recognized antileukemic drug used for the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). A major drawback of therapy with ATO is the development of APL cell resistance， the mechanisms of which are still not clear.Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in ATOtreated human acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells and in ATO-resistant clones.Material and methods:The cytotoxicity of ATO was assessed using Trypan blue staining or a WST-1 reduction assay. The Akt phosphorylation level was measured by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry. Gene expression analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Results:The clones derived by culturing for 8-12 weeks in the presence of 1.75， 2.5， and 5 μM ATO were characterized by high viability but a slower growth rate compared to the parental HL-60 cells. The flow cytometry analysis showed that in the parental cells the levels of p-Akt were undetectable or very low， and that ATO had no effect on the level of p-Akt in either the ATO-treated parental cells or the clones. The gene expression analysis revealed that some of the genes involved in the Akt pathway may play a key role in the induction of resistance to ATO， e.g.， genes encoding cyclin D1 (CCND1)， fork head box O1 (FOXO1)， Jun oncogene (JUN)， protein kinase C isoform B1 (PRKCB1)， because their expression profiles were predominantly changed in the clones and/or the ATO-treated parental HL-60 cells.Conclusions:The overall results indicate that CCND1， FOXO1， and JUN may contribute to the induction of resistance to ATO， and that the C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway may have greater significance than the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in mediating the cytotoxic effects of ATO and the development of resistance to ATO in the HL-60 cell line.Keywords:Akt kinase; C-Jun; HL-60 cells; arsenic resistant clones; arsenic trioxide.

Low or undetectable TPO receptor expression in malignant tissue and cell lines derived from breast， lung， and ovarian tumors.,BMC Cancer, 2012 Sep 11,22967017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22967017/,Background:Numerous efficacious chemotherapy regimens may cause thrombocytopenia. Thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists， such as eltrombopag， represent a novel approach for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The TPO-R MPL is expressed on megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte precursors， although little is known about its expression on other tissues.Methods:Breast， lung， and ovarian tumor samples were analyzed for MPL expression by microarray and/or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)， and for TPO-R protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cell line proliferation assays were used to analyze the in vitro effect of eltrombopag on breast， lung， and ovarian tumor cell proliferation. The lung carcinoma cell lines were also analyzed for TPO-R protein expression by Western blot.Results:MPL mRNA was not detectable in 118 breast tumors and was detectable at only very low levels in 48% of 29 lung tumors studied by microarray analysis. By qRT-PCR， low but detectable levels of MPL mRNA were detectable in some normal (14-43%) and malignant (3-17%) breast， lung， and ovarian tissues. A comparison of MPL to EPOR， ERBB2， and IGF1R mRNA demonstrates that MPL mRNA levels were far lower than those of EPOR and ERBB2 mRNA in the same tissues. IHC analysis showed negligible TPO-R protein expression in tumor tissues， confirming mRNA analysis. Culture of breast， lung， and ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed no increase， and in fact， showed a decrease in proliferation following incubation with eltrombopag. Western blot analyses revealed no detectable TPO-R protein expression in the lung carcinoma cell lines.Conclusions:Multiple analyses of breast， lung， and ovarian tumor samples and/or cell lines show no evidence of MPL mRNA or TPO-R protein expression. Eltrombopag does not stimulate growth of breast， lung， or ovarian tumor cell lines at doses likely to exert their actions on megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte precursors.

Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor enhances retinoic acid-induced gene expression.,J Leukoc Biol, 2006 Oct,16885501,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16885501/,We reported previously that treatment of human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in combination with GM-CSF enhances the granulocytic differentiation， which is induced only slightly by ATRA alone. To investigate the mechanism underlying this differentiation and the synergistic effect of ATRA and GM-CSF， we used cDNA microarray to examine gene expression profiles of ML-1 cells treated with ATRA and/or GM-CSF. We identified 22 up-regulated genes in ML-1 cells treated with both reagents and examined the expression of these genes in cells treated with ATRA and/or GM-CSF by Northern blot analysis. Comparison of cells treated with both reagents and cells treated with ATRA or GM-CSF alone revealed that expression of nine of the 19 genes was induced synergistically by combined treatment with ATRA and GM-CSF. Expression of most of these genes was increased only slightly by ATRA alone， and this induction was enhanced by the addition of GM-CSF. These results indicate that GM-CSF enhances ATRA-induced gene expression. Moreover， studies with inhibitors of signaling molecules suggested that activation of JAK2 is associated with the synergistic induction of several genes by ATRA and GM-CSF. JAK2 inhibitor suppressed induction of NBT-reducing activity in ML-1 cells treated with both reagents. It is likely that the enhancer effect of GM-CSF on ATRA-induced gene expression leads to the differentiation induced synergistically by ATRA combined with GM-CSF. Further studies of the mechanism underlying this effect may identify better approaches for the treatment of RA-insensitive leukemia.

Gene expression modulation and the molecular mechanisms involved in Nelfinavir resistance in Leishmania donovani axenic amastigotes.,Mol Microbiol, 2013 Aug,23782314,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23782314/,Drug resistance is a major public health challenge in leishmaniasis chemotherapy， particularly in the case of emerging Leishmania/HIV-1 co-infections. We have delineated the mechanism of cell death induced by the HIV-1 protease inhibitor， Nelfinavir， in the Leishmania parasite. In order to further study Nelfinavir-Leishmania interactions， we selected Nelfinavir-resistant axenic amastigotes in vitro and characterized them. RNA expression profiling analyses and comparative genomic hybridizations of closely related Leishmania species were used as a screening tool to compare Nelfinavir-resistant and -sensitive parasites in order to identify candidate genes involved in drug resistance. Microarray analyses of Nelfinavir-resistant and -sensitive Leishmania amastigotes suggest that parasites regulate mRNA levels either by modulating gene copy numbers through chromosome aneuploidy， or gene deletion/duplication by homologous recombination. Interestingly， supernumerary chromosomes 6 and 11 in the resistant parasites lead to upregulation of the ABC class of transporters. Transporter assays using radiolabelled Nelfinavir suggest a greater drug accumulation in the resistant parasites and in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore， high-resolution electron microscopy and measurements of intracellular polyphosphate levels showed an increased number of cytoplasmic vesicular compartments known as acidocalcisomes in Nelfinavir-resistant parasites. Together these results suggest that Nelfinavir is rapidly and dramatically sequestered in drug-induced intracellular vesicles.

Dysregulation of mRNA profile in cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC7901.,World J Gastroenterol, 2017 Feb 21,28275299,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28275299/,im:To explore novel therapeutic target of cisplatin resistance in human gastric cancer.Methods:The sensitivity of SGC7901 cells and cisplatin-resistant SGC7901 cells (SGC7901/DDP) for cisplatin were detected by 3-(4，5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2，5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. High-quality total RNA which isolated from SGC7901/DDP cells and SGC7901 cells were used for mRNA microarray analysis. Results were analyzed bioinformatically to predict their roles in the development of cisplatin resistance and the expression of 13 dysregulated mRNAs we selected were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).Results:SGC7901/DDP cells highly resistant to cisplatin demonstrated by MTT assay. A total of 1308 mRNAs (578 upregulated and 730 downregulated) were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2 andP-value < 0.05) in the SGC7901/DDP cells compared with SGC7901 cells. The expression of mRNAs detected by qRT-PCR were consistent with the microarray results. Gene Ontology， Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and protein-protein interaction analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched inPI3K-Akt，Notch，MAPK，ErbB，Jak-STAT，NF-kappaBsignaling pathways which may be involved in cisplatin resistance. Several genes such asPDE3B，VEGFC，IGFBP3，TLR4，HIPK2andEGFmay associated with drug resistance of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin.Conclusion:Exploration of those altered mRNAs may provide more promising strategy in diagnosis and therapy for gastric cancer with cisplatin resistance.Keywords:Biology; Cisplatin resistance; Dysregulate; Gastric cancer; Microarray.
The heat shock protein 90 inhibitor IPI-504 induces apoptosis of AKT-dependent diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.,Br J Haematol, 2009 Feb,19036086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19036086/,Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that stabilizes critical client proteins in multiple cancers. Gene expression profiling was utilized to characterize HSP90 isoform expression in primary human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). HSP90 alpha and beta isoforms were differentially expressed in subsets of tumours defined by their transcriptional profiles. Thereafter， we assessed the activity of the HSP90 inhibitor， IPI-504， in an extensive panel of DLBCL cell lines. IPI-504， which interacts with the conserved ATP-binding site in both HSP90 isoforms， inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in the majority of DLBCL cell lines at low micromolar concentrations. IPI-504-sensitive cell lines expressed high levels of the HSP90 client protein， pAKT， and exhibited dose-dependent decreases in pAKT levels following IPI-504 treatment and significantly reduced proliferation following AKT RNAi. Furthermore， the combination of low-dose (<1 micromol/l) IPI-504 and the AKT/Pi3K pathway inhibitor， LY24009， was synergistic in IPI-504-sensitive DLBCL cell lines. Low-dose IPI-504 was also synergistic with the chemotherapeutic agent， doxorubicin. The HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504 warrants further investigation in DLBCL alone and in combination with identified client protein inhibitors and active chemotherapeutic agents.
Responses of human endothelial cells to pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira species.,PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 2010 Dec 14,21179504,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21179504/,Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic infection that primarily affects residents of tropical regions， but causes infections in animals and humans in temperate regions as well. The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira， which also includes non-pathogenic， saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild， non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells， we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix， but that the changes were in opposite directions， with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity， while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans， however， did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that， through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells， the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function， promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition， supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.
Hypoxia induces protection against etoposide-induced apoptosis: molecular profiling of changes in gene expression and transcription factor activity.,Mol Cancer, 2008 Mar 26,18366759,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18366759/,Background:it is now well established that hypoxia renders tumor cells resistant to radio- but also chemotherapy. However， few elements are currently available as for the mechanisms underlying this protection.Results:in this study， physiological hypoxia was shown to inhibit apoptosis induced in HepG2 cells by etoposide. Indeed， hypoxia reduced DNA fragmentation， caspase activation and PARP cleavage. The DNA binding activity of 10 transcription factors was followed while the actual transcriptional activity was measured using specific reporter plasmids. Of note is the inhibition of the etoposide-induced activation of p53 under hypoxia. In parallel， data from low density DNA microarrays indicate that the expression of several pro- and anti-apoptotic genes was modified， among which are Bax and Bak whose expression profile paralleled p53 activity. Cluster analysis of data unravels several possible pathways involved in the hypoxia-induced protection against etoposide-induced apoptosis: one of them could be the inhibition of p53 activity under hypoxia since caspase 3 activity parallels Bax and Bak expression profile. Moreover， specific downregulation of HIF-1alpha by RNA interference significantly enhanced apoptosis under hypoxia possibly by preventing the hypoxia mediated decrease in Bak expression without altering Bax expression.Conclusion:these results are a clear demonstration that hypoxia has a direct protective effect on apoptotic cell death. Moreover， molecular profiling points to putative pathways responsible for tumor growth in challenging environmental conditions and cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.
Downregulation of ornithine decarboxylase by pcDNA-ODCr inhibits gastric cancer cell growth in vitro.,Mol Biol Rep, 2011 Feb,20533091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20533091/,Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)， the first rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis， was found to be associated with cell growth， proliferation and transformation. ODC gene expression in gastric cancer was increased and its level was positively correlated with the degree of malignity of gastric mucosa and development of gastric lesions. In order to evaluate the therapeutic effects of antisense RNA of ODC on gastric cancer， an antisense RNA of ODC expressing plasmid pcDNA-ODCr which delivered a 120 bp fragment complementary to the initiation codon of ODC gene was constructed and transfected to gastric cancer cells SGC7901 and MGC803. Expression of ODC in gastric cancer cells was determined by western blot. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTS assay. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry and Matrigel assay was performed to assess the ability of gastric cancer cell invasiveness. The results showed that the ODC gene expression in gastric cancer cells transfected with the pcDNA-ODCr was downregulated efficiently. Tumor cell proliferation was suppressed significantly， and cell cycle was arrested at G1 phase. Gastric cancer cells had reduced invasiveness after gene transfer. Our study suggested that antisense RNA of ODC expressing plasmid pcDNA-ODCr had antitumor activity by inhibiting the expression of ODC， and downregulation of ODC expression using a gene therapy approach might be a novel therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.
Stress resistant human embryonic stem cells as a potential source for the identification of novel cancer stem cell markers.,Cancer Lett, 2010 Mar 28,19733430,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19733430/,Cancer stem cells are known for their inherent resistance to therapy. Here we investigated whether normal stem cells with acquired resistance to stress can be used to identify novel markers of cancer stem cells. For this， we generated a human embryonic stem cell line resistant to Trichostatin A and analyzed changes in its gene expression. The resistant cells over-expressed various genes associated with tumor aggressiveness， many of which are also expressed in the CD133+ glioma cancer stem cells. These findings suggest that stress-resistant stem cells generated in vitro may be useful for the discovery of novel markers of cancer stem cells.
Transcriptional profiling of targets for combination therapy of lung carcinoma with paclitaxel and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor.,Cancer Res, 2003 Aug 15,12941840,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12941840/, combination of paclitaxel (Taxol) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK/Erk) inhibitor represents a rational new approach to chemotherapy. We performed Affymetrix microarray analysis to understand the global effects of this combination in lung carcinoma. Genes involved in cell cycle control， apoptosis， adhesion， proliferation， invasion， and metastasis were modulated. We observed similar patterns of gene modulation in ovarian and melanoma cell lines， indicating the general applicability of these findings. Functional genomic analysis identified two genes as new targets of drug-induced tumor apoptosis. The MGSA/Gro1 gene， important in melanoma growth， was induced by paclitaxel and reduced by MEK inhibition. Blockage of paclitaxel-induced melanoma growth stimulatory activity significantly reduced melanoma growth. Additionally， the expression of topoisomerase III beta， which exhibited a clear pattern of gene reduction by a combination of the two drugs， was significantly increased (5.7-fold) in primary lung cancers but not adjacent tissues. These findings provide potential new biomarkers and gene targets for the development of improved cancer treatment.
Prostate cancer cell lines under hypoxia exhibit greater stem-like properties.,PLoS One, 2011,22216200,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22216200/,Hypoxia is an important environmental change in many cancers. Hypoxic niches can be occupied by cancer stem/progenitor-like cells that are associated with tumor progression and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However， it has not yet been fully elucidated how hypoxia influences the stem-like properties of prostate cancer cells. In this report， we investigated the effects of hypoxia on human prostate cancer cell lines， PC-3 and DU145. In comparison to normoxia (20% O(2))， 7% O(2) induced higher expressions of HIF-1α and HIF-2α， which were associated with upregulation of Oct3/4 and Nanog; 1% O(2) induced even greater levels of these factors. The upregulated NANOG mRNA expression in hypoxia was confirmed to be predominantly retrogene NANOGP8. Similar growth rates were observed for cells cultivated under hypoxic and normoxic conditions for 48 hours; however， the colony formation assay revealed that 48 hours of hypoxic pretreatment resulted in the formation of more colonies. Treatment with 1% O(2) also extended the G(0)/G(1) stage， resulting in more side population cells， and induced CD44 and ABCG2 expressions. Hypoxia also increased the number of cells positive for ABCG2 expression， which were predominantly found to be CD44(bright) cells. Correspondingly， the sorted CD44(bright) cells expressed higher levels of ABCG2， Oct3/4， and Nanog than CD44(dim) cells， and hypoxic pretreatment significantly increased the expressions of these factors. CD44(bright) cells under normoxia formed significantly more colonies and spheres compared with the CD44(dim) cells， and hypoxic pretreatment even increased this effect. Our data indicate that prostate cancer cells under hypoxia possess greater stem-like properties.
Phytoestrogens regulate the proliferation and expression of stem cell factors in cell lines of malignant testicular germ cell tumors.,Int J Oncol, 2013 Nov,23969837,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23969837/,Phytoestrogens have been shown to exert anti-proliferative effects on different cancer cells. In addition it could be demonstrated that inhibition of proliferation is associated with downregulation of the known stem cell factors NANOG， POU5F1 and SOX2 in tumor cells. We demonstrate the potential of Belamcanda chinensis extract (BCE) and tectorigenin as anticancer drugs in cell lines of malignant testicular germ cell tumor cells (TGCT) by inhibition of proliferation and regulating the expression of stem cell factors. The TGCT cell lines TCam-2 and NTera-2 were treated with BCE or tectorigenin and MTT assay was used to measure the proliferation of tumor cells. In addition， the expression of stem cell factors was analyzed by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore， global expression analysis was performed by microarray technique. BCE and tectorigenin inhibited proliferation and downregulated the stem cell factors NANOG and POU5F1 in TGCT cells. In addition， gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes important for the differentiation and inhibition of oncogenes. Utilizing connectivity map in an attempt to elucidate mechanism underlying BCE treatments we found highly positive association to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) amongst others. Causing no histone deacetylase inhibition， the effects of BCE on proliferation and stem cell factors may be based on histone-independent mechanisms such as direct hyperacetylation of transcription factors. Based on these findings， phytoestrogens may be useful as new agents in the treatment of TGCT.
Riproximin modulates multiple signaling cascades leading to cytostatic and apoptotic effects in human breast cancer cells.,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol, 2016 Jan,26163990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26163990/,Background:Riproximin， a type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP)， has shown significant cytotoxic effects in diverse types of cancer cells. To better understand its therapeutic potential， elaborated investigations on the mechanistic aspects of riproximin deem crucial. In this study， we focused on riproximin-mediated changes in cellular properties and corresponding molecular pathways in breast cancer cells.Methods:Cytotoxicity of riproximin was determined by MTT assay， while the clonogenic and migratory effects were determined by colony formation， migration， and scratch assays. Cytostatic and apoptotic effects were studied by flow cytometry and nuclear staining procedures. Alterations at molecular levels were scrutinized by means of microarray and qRT-PCR methodologies.Results:Riproximin induced significant cytotoxic effects in the selected human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Profound inhibition of migration and colony formation were observed in both cell lines in response to riproximin exposure. Concomitantly， a significant arrest in S phase and nuclear fragmentation were observed as causes for its cytostatic and apoptotic effects， respectively. Genetic profiling revealed pronounced induction of the anticancer cytokine IL24/MDA-7 and ER-stress-related GADD genes. In addition， prominent inhibition of the genes relevant to migration (RHO GTPases)， anti-apoptotic activities (BCL family)， and cell cycle (cyclins) was also noticed.Conclusion:Riproximin， with its significant antineoplastic effects， modulates multiple cytostatic and apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells. Results from these investigations highlight the future therapeutic potential of this naturally occurring compound for breast cancer.Keywords:Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Cytostatic; IL24/MDA-7; Riproximin; Type II RIP.
Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2015 Jul 21,26162681,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26162681/,"The organometallic ""half-sandwich"" compound [Os(η(6)-p-cymene)(4-(2-pyridylazo)-N，N-dimethylaniline)I]PF6 is 49× more potent than the clinical drug cisplatin in the 809 cancer cell lines that we screened and is a candidate drug for cancer therapy. We investigate the mechanism of action of compound 1 in A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Whole-transcriptome sequencing identified three missense mutations in the mitochondrial genome of this cell line， coding for ND5， a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) in the electron transport chain. ND5 is a proton pump， helping to maintain the coupling gradient in mitochondria. The identified mutations correspond to known protein variants (p.I257V， p.N447S， and p.L517P)， not reported previously in epithelial ovarian cancer. Time-series RNA sequencing suggested that osmium-exposed A2780 cells undergo a metabolic shunt from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation， where defective machinery， associated with mutations in complex I， could enhance activity. Downstream events， measured by time-series reverse-phase protein microarrays， high-content imaging， and flow cytometry， showed a dramatic increase in mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent DNA damage with up-regulation of ATM， p53， and p21 proteins. In contrast to platinum drugs， exposure to this organo-osmium compound does not cause significant apoptosis within a 72-h period， highlighting a different mechanism of action. Superoxide production in ovarian， lung， colon， breast， and prostate cancer cells exposed to three other structurally related organo-Os(II) compounds correlated with their antiproliferative activity. DNA damage caused indirectly， through selective ROS generation， may provide a more targeted approach to cancer therapy and a concept for next-generation metal-based anticancer drugs that combat platinum resistance.Keywords:cancer metabolism; mitochondria; organometallic anticancer compound; protein microarrays; transcriptome sequencing."
Activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) is a key determinant of resistance to endocrine treatment in an in vitro model of breast cancer.,Breast Cancer Res, 2020 Nov 16,33198803,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33198803/,Background:Activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2)， a member of the leucine zipper family of DNA binding proteins， has been implicated as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer. However， its exact role in breast cancer endocrine resistance is still unclear. We have previously shown that silencing of ATF2 leads to a loss in the growth-inhibitory effects of tamoxifen in the oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive， tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cell line and highlighted that this multi-faceted transcription factor is key to the effects of tamoxifen in an endocrine sensitive model. In this work， we explored further the in vitro role of ATF2 in defining the resistance to endocrine treatment.Materials and methods:We knocked down ATF2 in TAMR， LCC2 and LCC9 tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines as well as the parental tamoxifen sensitive MCF7 cell line and investigated the effects on growth， colony formation and cell migration. We also performed a microarray gene expression profiling (Illumina Human HT12_v4) to explore alterations in gene expression between MCF7 and TAMRs after ATF2 silencing and confirmed gene expression changes by quantitative RT-PCR.Results:By silencing ATF2， we observed a significant growth reduction of TAMR， LCC2 and LCC9 with no such effect observed with the parental MCF7 cells. ATF2 silencing was also associated with a significant inhibition of TAMR， LCC2 and LCC9 cell migration and colony formation. Interestingly， knockdown of ATF2 enhanced the levels of ER and ER-regulated genes， TFF1， GREB1， NCOA3 and PGR， in TAMR cells both at RNA and protein levels. Microarray gene expression identified a number of genes known to mediate tamoxifen resistance， to be differentially regulated by ATF2 in TAMR in relation to the parental MCF7 cells. Moreover， differential pathway analysis confirmed enhanced ER activity after ATF2 knockdown in TAMR cells.Conclusion:These data demonstrate that ATF2 silencing may overcome endocrine resistance and highlights further the dual role of this transcription factor that can mediate endocrine sensitivity and resistance by modulating ER expression and activity.Keywords:ATF2; Breast cancer; Endocrine resistance; Tamoxifen.
RPL13A as a reference gene for normalizing mRNA transcription of ovarian cancer cells with paclitaxel and 10-hydroxycamptothecin treatments.,Mol Med Rep, 2015 Apr,25523336,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25523336/,Gene transcription analysis is important in cancer research， and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) has been demonstrated to be an effective method to evaluate gene transcription in cancer. RT‑qPCR requires an internal reference gene with a consistent level of mRNA transcription across various experimental conditions. However， it has been suggested that different treatments， including anticancer therapy， may influence the transcriptional stability of internal reference genes. Paclitaxel (PTX) and 10‑hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) are widely used to treat various types of cancer， and a suitable internal reference gene is required in order to analyze the transcription profiles of the cells following treatment. In the current study， the transcriptional stability of 30 candidate reference genes was investigated in cancer cells following treatment with PTX and HCPT. The two ovarian cancer cell lines， UACC‑1598 and SKOV3， were treated with PTX and HCPT for 24 and 48 h， and the transcriptional levels of the candidate reference genes were subsequently evaluated by RT‑qPCR analysis. The transcriptional stability of the selected genes was then analyzed using qbase+ and NormFinder software. A total of 9 genes were demonstrated to exhibit high transcriptional stability and one of these genes， ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A)， was identified to exhibit high transcriptional stability in every group. The current study identified various reference genes suitable under different circumstances， while RPL13A was indicated to be the most suitable reference gene for analyzing the transcription profile of ovarian cancer cells following treatment with PTX and HCPT.
Interferon-alpha promotes the anti-proliferative effect of Erlotinib (OSI-774) on human colon cancer cell lines.,Cancer Lett, 2005 Jul 8,15922858,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15922858/,Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) treatment is associated with up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/EGFR) expression and marked growth inhibition while maintaining the sensitivity of the target colon cancer cells to epidermal growth factor (Gut 2004;53:123). We aimed to determine the effect of combining IFNalpha and Erlotinib (an HER1/EGFR inhibitor) on colon cancer cell line growth. Crystal-violet staining and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation and expression of HER1/EGFR. IFNalpha pre-treatment followed by a combination of IFNalpha plus Erlotinib significantly enhanced the sensitivity of 7/9 of colon cancer cell lines by 7-43%. This approach may have clinical implications for improving treatment based on targeting of HER1/EGFR.
Hypertension Susceptibility Loci are Associated with Anthracycline-related Cardiotoxicity in Long-term Childhood Cancer Survivors.,Sci Rep, 2017 Aug 29,28851949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28851949/,nthracycline-based chemotherapy is associated with dose-dependent， irreversible damage to the heart. Childhood cancer survivors with hypertension after anthracycline exposure are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity， leading to the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility loci for hypertension may serve as predictors for development of late cardiotoxicity. Therefore， we determined the association between 12 GWAS-identified hypertension-susceptibility loci and cardiotoxicity in a cohort of long-term childhood cancer survivors (N = 108) who received anthracyclines and were screened for cardiac function via echocardiograms. Hypertension-susceptibility alleles of PLCE1:rs9327264 and ATP2B1:rs17249754 were significantly associated with cardiotoxicity risk conferring a protective effect with a 64% (95% CI: 0.18-0.76， P = 0.0068) and 74% (95% CI: 0.07-0.96， P = 0.040) reduction in risk， respectively. In RNAseq experiments of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin， both PLCE1 and ATP2B1 displayed anthracycline-dependent gene expression profiles. In silico functional assessment further supported this relationship - rs9327264 in PLCE1 (P = 0.0080) and ATP2B1 expression (P = 0.0079) were both significantly associated with daunorubicin IC50values in a panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that the hypertension-susceptibility variants in PLCE1 and ATP2B1 confer a protective effect on risk of developing anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity， and functional analyses suggest that these genes are influenced by exposure to anthracyclines.
Integrated transcriptome and in vitro analysis revealed anti-proliferative effect of sodium perborate on hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,J Trace Elem Med Biol, 2022 Sep,35716648,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35716648/,Background:Hepatocelular carcinoma is one of the leading cancer types with no effective cure as poor prognosis is still a challenging aspect. Thus， alternative therapeutics are necessary to control hepatocelular carcinoma. Boron derivatives such as boric acid (BA)， sodium perborate tetrahydrate (SPT) and sodium pentaborate pentahydrate (NaB) have been discovered to have anti-cancer effect. This study investigated the anti-proliferative effects of SPT against hepatocelular carcinoma (HCC) using in vitro and transcriptome approaches.Methods:Cytotoxic level of SPT on cell survival were detected using MTS assay. The apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest was determined using Annexin V/PI and cell cycle assay， respectively. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA-seq， followed by functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. qPCR was used to validate the different genes.Results:SPT treated HepG2 and Hep3B cells induced cytotoxicity having IC50values of 1.13 mM and 0.91 mM， respectively. SPT caused mitotic arrest in G0/G1phase at 48 h and subsequent apoptotic cell death. RNA-seq revealed a total number of 822 and 1075 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which after SPT treatment in HepG2 and Hep3B cells， respectively. Functional and KEGG pathway enrichment results suggested that there are several genes involved to induce apoptosis related pathways. The DEGs in p53 signaling pathway may have closely relationships to the cells apoptosis caused by SPT treatment. qPCR results validated dynamic changes in p53 signaling pathway， DNA replication and cell cycle related genes， such as CDKN1A， SERPINE1， PMAIP1， MCM3， MCM5 and MCM6.Conclusion:In vitro experiments and RNA-seq analysis show anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect of SPT in HCC cells. Further studies might help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of SPT.Keywords:Anti-cancer therapy; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Sodium perborate tetrahydrate; Transcriptome analysis.
Functional annotation of IFN-alpha-stimulated gene expression profiles from sensitive and resistant renal cell carcinoma cell lines.,J Interferon Cytokine Res, 2006 Aug,16881864,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16881864/,The antiproliferative， antiviral， and immunomodulatory properties of interferons (IFNs) have led to its therapeutic implementation. IFNs effects are mediated by a complex network of signal transducers， culminating in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction. This complexity leads to diverse clinical responses to IFN， from no response to complete regression of disease. Elucidation of ISG induction patterns is， therefore， essential to understand and maximize its therapeutic potential. To correlate ISG expression profiles with IFN responsiveness， two renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines differing in antiviral and apoptotic response to IFN were treated with IFN-alpha for different times， and expression profiles were analyzed using a customized microarray containing 850 unique putative ISGs. Genes with similar kinetics of induction in both cell lines were clustered and analyzed for gene function. Seven sets of coordinately regulated genes were identified by k-means cluster analysis， and significant functional similarities were identified for five of the seven sets. Strikingly， expression of genes associated with transcription temporally preceded expression of those involved in signal transduction. Enhanced antiviral sensitivity to IFN was coincident with sustained expression of ISGs involved in transcriptional regulation. However， no difference in Stat1 activation was observed between the cell lines. Analysis of ISG expression patterns suggests that subtle differences in transcription profiles contribute to differences in IFN responsiveness.
Novel chemotherapeutic agent FX-9 activates NF-kappaB signaling and induces G1 phase arrest by activating CDKN1A in a human prostate cancer cell line.,BMC Cancer, 2021 Oct 8,34625047,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625047/,Background:The aminoisoquinoline FX-9 shows pro-apoptotic and antimitotic effects against lymphoblastic leukemia cells and prostate adenocarcinoma cells. In contrast， decreased cytotoxic effects against non-neoplastic blood cells， chondrocytes， and fibroblasts were observed. However， the actual FX-9 molecular mode of action is currently not fully understood.Methods:In this study， microarray gene expression analysis comparing FX-9 exposed and unexposed prostate cancer cells (PC-3 representing castration-resistant prostate cancer)， followed by pathway analysis and gene annotation to functional processes were performed. Immunocytochemistry staining was performed with selected targets.Results:Expression analysis revealed 0.83% of 21，448 differential expressed genes (DEGs) after 6-h exposure of FX-9 and 0.68% DEGs after 12-h exposure thereof. Functional annotation showed that FX-9 primarily caused an activation of inflammatory response by non-canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. The 6-h samples showed activation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A which might be involved in the secondary response in 12-h samples. This secondary response predominantly consisted of cell cycle-related changes， with further activation of CDKN1A and inhibition of the transcription factor E2F1， including downstream target genes， resulting in G1-phase arrest. Matching our previous observations on cellular level senescence signaling pathways were also found enriched. To verify these results immunocytochemical staining of p21 Waf1/Cip1 (CDKN1A)， E2F1 (E2F1)， PAI-1 (SERPNE1)， and NFkB2/NFkB p 100 (NFKB2) was performed. Increased expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and NFkB2/NFkB p 100 after 24-h exposure to FX-9 was shown. E2F1 and PAI-1 showed no increased expression.Conclusions:FX-9 induced G1-phase arrest of PC-3 cells through activation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A， which was initiated by an inflammatory response of noncanonical NF-κB signaling.Keywords:Antimitotic agent; G1-phase arrest; Isoquinolinamine FX-9; Microarray analysis; NF-κB signaling; Prostate cancer.
Dysregulation of autism-associated synaptic proteins by psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations.,Neurosci Lett, 2017 Nov 20,28965935,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28965935/,utism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex neurological disorders for which the prevalence in the U.S. is currently estimated to be 1 in 50 children. A majority of cases of idiopathic autism in children likely result from unknown environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. These triggers may include maternal exposure of a developing embryo to environmentally relevant minute concentrations of psychoactive pharmaceuticals through ineffectively purified drinking water. Previous studies in our lab examined the extent to which gene sets associated with neuronal development were up- and down-regulated (enriched) in the brains of fathead minnows treated with psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations. The aim of this study was to determine whether similar treatments would alter in vitro expression of ASD-associated synaptic proteins on differentiated human neuronal cells. Human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were differentiated for two weeks with 10μM retinoic acid (RA) and treated with environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoxetine， carbamazepine or venlafaxine， and flow cytometry technique was used to analyze expression of ASD-associated synaptic proteins. Data showed that carbamazepine individually， venlafaxine individually and mixture treatment at environmental concentrations significantly altered the expression of key synaptic proteins (NMDAR1， PSD95， SV2A， HTR1B， HTR2C and OXTR). Data indicated that psychoactive pharmaceuticals at extremely low concentrations altered the in vitro expression of key synaptic proteins that may potentially contribute to neurological disorders like ASD by disrupting neuronal development.Keywords:Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); Drinking water; Environmental toxicology; Psychoactive pharmaceuticals.
Association of a novel endometrial cancer biomarker panel with prognostic risk， platinum insensitivity， and targetable therapeutic options.,PLoS One, 2021 Jan 27,33503056,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503056/,During the past decade， the age-adjusted mortality rate for endometrial cancer (EC) increased 1.9% annually with TP53 mutant (TP53-mu) EC disproportionally represented in advanced disease and deaths. Therefore， we aimed to assess pivotal molecular parameters that differentiate clinical outcomes in high- and low-risk EC. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas， we analyzed EC specimens with available DNA sequences and quantitative gene-specific RNA expression data. After polymerase ɛ (POLE)-mutant specimens were excluded， differential gene-specific mutations and mRNA expressions were annotated and integrated. Consequent to TP53-mu failure to induce p21， derepression of multiple oncogenes harboring promoter p21 repressive sites was observed， including CCNA2 and FOXM1 (P < .001 compared with TP53 wild type [TP53-wt]). TP53-wt EC with high CCNA2 expression (CCNA2-H) had a targeted transcriptomic profile similar to that of TP53-mu EC， suggesting CCNA2 is a seminal determinant for both TP53-wt and TP53-mu EC. CCNA2 enhances E2F1 function， upregulating FOXM1 and CIP2A， as observed in TP53-mu and CCNA2-H TP53-wt EC (P < .001). CIP2A inhibits protein phosphatase 2A， leading to AKT inactivation of GSK3β and restricted oncoprotein degradation; PPP2R1A and FBXW7 mutations yield similar results. Upregulation of FOXM1 and failed degradation of FOXM1 is evidenced by marked upregulation of multiple homologous recombination genes (P < .001). Integrating these molecular aberrations generated a molecular biomarker panel with significant prognostic discrimination (P = 5.8×10-7); adjusting for age， histology， grade， myometrial invasion， TP53 status， and stage， only CCNA2-H/E2F1-H (P = .0003)， FBXW7-mu/PPP2R1A-mu (P = .0002)， and stage (P = .017) were significant. The generated prognostic molecular classification system identifies dissimilar signaling aberrations potentially amenable to targetable therapeutic options.
cDNA microarray gene expression profiling of hedgehog signaling pathway inhibition in human colon cancer cells.,PLoS One, 2010 Oct 1,20957031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20957031/,Background:Hedgehog (HH) signaling plays a critical role in normal cellular processes， in normal mammalian gastrointestinal development and differentiation， and in oncogenesis and maintenance of the malignant phenotype in a variety of human cancers. Increasing evidence further implicates the involvement of HH signaling in oncogenesis and metastatic behavior of colon cancers. However， genomic approaches to elucidate the role of HH signaling in cancers in general are lacking， and data derived on HH signaling in colon cancer is extremely limited.Methodology/principal findings:To identify unique downstream targets of the GLI genes， the transcriptional regulators of HH signaling， in the context of colon carcinoma， we employed a small molecule inhibitor of both GLI1 and GLI2， GANT61， in two human colon cancer cell lines， HT29 and GC3/c1. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated accumulation of GANT61-treated cells at the G1/S boundary. cDNA microarray gene expression profiling of 18，401 genes identified Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) both common and unique to HT29 and GC3/c1. Analyses using GenomeStudio (statistics)， Matlab (heat map)， Ingenuity (canonical pathway analysis)， or by qRT-PCR， identified p21(Cip1) (CDKN1A) and p15(Ink4b) (CDKN2B)， which play a role in the G1/S checkpoint， as up-regulated genes at the G1/S boundary. Genes that determine further cell cycle progression at G1/S including E2F2， CYCLIN E2 (CCNE2)， CDC25A and CDK2， and genes that regulate passage of cells through G2/M (CYCLIN A2 [CCNA2]， CDC25C， CYCLIN B2 [CCNB2]， CDC20 and CDC2 [CDK1]， were down-regulated. In addition， novel genes involved in stress response， DNA damage response， DNA replication and DNA repair were identified following inhibition of HH signaling.Conclusions/significance:This study identifies genes that are involved in HH-dependent cellular proliferation in colon cancer cells， and following its inhibition， genes that regulate cell cycle progression and events downstream of the G1/S boundary.

Alteration of gene expression in melanoma cells following combined treatment with E2F-1 and doxorubicin.,Anticancer Res, 2006 May-Jun,16827129,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16827129/,Background:The combination of E2F-1 gene therapy and chemotherapy produces a synergistic effect on melanoma cell apoptosis. However， the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify novel genes or pathways that may play key roles in apoptosis when E2F-1 gene therapy is combined with doxorubicin chemotherapy.Materials and methods:SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells were infected with Ad-E2F-1 alone， Ad-E2F-1 plus doxorubicin， or Ad-LacZ plus doxorubicin. After 16 hours of treatment， the total RNA was extracted from these cells and subjected to microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to confirm the microarray data.Results:Our results showed that the combination treatment of Ad-E2F-1 and doxorubicin affected the expression of cytokines， transcription factors， as well as genes involved in signal transduction， cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.Conclusion:Our findings have identified， for the first time， novel molecular targets and pathways that led to apoptosis in melanoma cells when Ad-E2F-1 was combined with doxorubicin. The molecular information provided here will enhance further mechanistic studies.

Differential miRNA expression profiles in human keratinocytes in response to protein kinase C inhibitor.,Mol Med Rep, 2017 Nov,28901412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28901412/,errant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is widely accepted to be involved in keratinocyte differentiation and to be dependent on activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. However， the miRNA profiles and biological characteristics of keratinocytes induced by specific inhibitors of PKC have yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the differential miRNA expression profiles in keratinocytes treated with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X， by conducting a bioinformatics analysis. Parts of the GF109203X‑induced keratinocytes formed distinct clones after 2 days of culture， and the expression of intergrin β1， cytokeratin (CK)19 and CK14 were positive， whereas CK10 expression was negative. A total of 79 miRNAs were differentially expressed in keratinocytes treated with GF109203X， among which 45 miRNAs were upregulated and 34 were downregulated. The significantly upregulated microRNAs includedhsa‑miR‑1‑3p and miR‑181c‑5p， whereas hsa‑miR‑31‑5p and hsa‑let‑7c‑3p were significantly downregulated. In addition， the results of reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction exhibited consistency with the microarray results. An enrichment analysis demonstrated that certain target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs serve an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation， cell cycle progression and apoptosis， etc. These results revealed that GF109203X induced the differential expression of certain miRNAs when keratinocytes began showing the characteristics of epidermal‑like stem cells， which may provide a novel approach for wound healing and regeneration of skin tissues.

CD30-induced signaling is absent in Hodgkin's cells but present in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells.,Am J Pathol, 2008 Feb,18187570,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18187570/,High CD30 expression in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) suggests an important pathogenic role of this cytokine receptor. To test this hypothesis， we investigated CD30 signaling in Hodgkin's and ALCL cell lines by different approaches: 1) CD30 stimulation， 2) CD30 down-regulation， and 3) a combination of both. The effects were determined at the RNA (microarray and real-time quantitative RT-PCR)， protein (electrophoretic mobility shift analysis， immunoblot， and flow cytometry)， and cellular/functional (proliferation and apoptosis) levels. We demonstrate that Hodgkin's cells are virtually CD30 unresponsive. Neither CD30 stimulation nor CD30 silencing of Hodgkin's cells had any significant effect. In contrast， CD30 stimulation of ALCL cells activated nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)， induced major transcriptional changes， and decreased proliferation. These effects could be abrogated by down-regulation of CD30. Stimulation of CD30 in ALCL cells， stably transfected with a dominant-negative NF-kappaB inhibitor， induced pronounced caspase activation and massive apoptosis. Our data indicate that 1) CD30 signaling is not effective in Hodgkin's cell lines but is effective in ALCL cell lines， 2) CD30 is probably not significantly involved in the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma， and 3) CD30 stimulation triggers two competing effects in ALCL cells， namely activation of caspases and NF-kappaB-mediated survival. These data suggest that CD30-targeted therapy in ALCL should be combined with NF-kappaB inhibitors to induce effective cell killing.
Whole genome gene expression analysis reveals casiopeina-induced apoptosis pathways.,PLoS One, 2013,23382936,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23382936/,Copper-based chemotherapeutic compounds Casiopeínas， have been presented as able to promote selective programmed cell death in cancer cells， thus being proper candidates for targeted cancer therapy. DNA fragmentation and apoptosis-in a process mediated by reactive oxygen species-for a number of tumor cells， have been argued to be the main mechanisms. However， a detailed functional mechanism (a model) is still to be defined and interrogated for a wide variety of cellular conditions before establishing settings and parameters needed for their wide clinical application. In order to shorten the gap in this respect， we present a model proposal centered in the role played by intrinsic (or mitochondrial) apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress caused by the chemotherapeutic agent. This model has been inferred based on genome wide expression profiling in cervix cancer (HeLa) cells， as well as statistical and computational tests， validated via functional experiments (both in the same HeLa cells and also in a Neuroblastoma model， the CHP-212 cell line) and assessed by means of data mining studies.
A mechanistic pan-cancer pathway model informed by multi-omics data interprets stochastic cell fate responses to drugs and mitogens.,PLoS Comput Biol, 2018 Mar 26,29579036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29579036/,Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context， simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD， which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin， but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK， and not AKT， dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability， which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation， consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context， a glioma cell line， allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates， providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.
Gene expression profiling of lung myofibroblasts reveals the anti-fibrotic effects of cyclosporine.,Tohoku J Exp Med, 2014 Aug,25132585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25132585/,Cyclosporine， a calcineurin inhibitor， is a potent immunosuppressive agent that acts chiefly through the inactivation of T-lymphocytes. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cyclosporine for treating fibrotic lung disease， but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that cyclosporine exerts direct effects against fibrogenesis of lung myofibroblasts， and aimed to elucidate the mechanism of this anti-fibrotic effect through gene-expression profiling using DNA microarray analysis. We found that cyclosporine suppressed the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen type I in myofibroblasts that had been differentiated from a fetal human lung fibroblast cell line by induction with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Furthermore， microarray analysis revealed that cyclosporine down-regulated 57 genes whose expression levels were increased by TGF-β， and up-regulated 73 genes， whose expression was decreased by TGF-β. Classifying these 57 down-regulated and 73 up-regulated genes with the Database for Annotation， Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) web tool， we have identified the involvement of several functional categories， including innate immunity， cytokine interaction， growth factor， and cancer pathway. Of the identified genes， we selected three fibrosis-related genes， insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2)， inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG)， and validated their expression patterns by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cyclosporine treatment decreased the expression levels of IGFBP2 and ID1， but increased PPARG expression. These results suggest that cyclosporine is a potent anti-fibrotic agent acting on myofibroblasts. Therefore， cyclosporine shows potential as a novel remedy for fibrotic lung disease.
Maintenance of human chondrogenic phenotype on a dendrimer-immobilized surface for an application of cell sheet engineering.,BMC Biotechnol, 2018 Mar 14,29540167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29540167/,Background:Dedifferentiation of chondrocytes during cell expansion is one of the barriers in tissue construction for cartilage repair. To understand chondrocyte behavior and improve cell expansion in monolayer culture， this study investigated the effects of morphological changes and cellular aggregation on the maintenance of chondrogenic capacity by observing the expression patterns of chondrogenic (collagen type II and aggrecan) and dedifferentiation (collagen type I) markers. Primary human chondrocytes were cultured on either a polystyrene surface (PS) or a polyamidoamine dendrimer surface with a fifth-generation (G5) dendron structure to create a one-step process of cell expansion and the maintenance of chondrogenic activities prior to the construction of cell sheets.Results:During the first two passages (P0 - P2)， the relative mRNA level of collagen type II decreased in all cultures， while that of collagen type I increased. Remarkably， the level of collagen type II was higher and aggrecan was retained in the chondrocytes， forming cell aggregates and showing some round-shaped cells with less production of stress fibers on the G5 surface compared to fibroblast-like chondrocytes with abundant stress fibers on the PS surface. The numbers of P2 chondrocytes on the G5 and PS surfaces were nearly the same and sufficient for construction of chondrocyte sheets using a temperature-responsive plate. Without a supporting material during cell sheet manipulation， chondrocyte sheets spontaneously detached and exhibited a honeycomb-like structure of stress fibers. Unlike the chondrocyte sheets constructed from cells on the PS surface， the chondrocyte sheets from cells on the G5 surface had higher chondrogenic activities， as evidenced by the high expression of chondrogenic markers and the low expression of dedifferentiation markers.Conclusions:The one-step process of cell expansion and maintenance of chondrogenic activity could be obtained using the G5 surface. Human chondrocyte sheets were successfully constructed with high chondrogenic activity. These findings may lead to an alternative cultivation technique for human chondrocytes that offers high clinical potential in autologous chondrocyte implantation.Keywords:Chondrocyte sheet; Dendrimer surface; Extracellular matrix formation; Human chondrocytes; Morphological change; Stress fiber formation.

Development of a toxicogenomics signature for genotoxicity using a dose-optimization and informatics strategy in human cells.,Environ Mol Mutagen, 2015 Jul,25733355,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25733355/,The development of in vitro molecular biomarkers to accurately predict toxicological effects has become a priority to advance testing strategies for human health risk assessment. The application of in vitro transcriptomic biomarkers promises increased throughput as well as a reduction in animal use. However， the existing protocols for predictive transcriptional signatures do not establish appropriate guidelines for dose selection or account for the fact that toxic agents may have pleiotropic effects. Therefore， comparison of transcriptome profiles across agents and studies has been difficult. Here we present a dataset of transcriptional profiles for TK6 cells exposed to a battery of well-characterized genotoxic and nongenotoxic chemicals. The experimental conditions applied a new dose optimization protocol that was based on evaluating expression changes in several well-characterized stress-response genes using quantitative real-time PCR in preliminary dose-finding studies. The subsequent microarray-based transcriptomic analyses at the optimized dose revealed responses to the test chemicals that were typically complex， often exhibiting substantial overlap in the transcriptional responses between a variety of the agents making analysis challenging. Using the nearest shrunken centroids method we identified a panel of 65 genes that could accurately classify toxicants as genotoxic or nongenotoxic. To validate the 65-gene panel as a genomic biomarker of genotoxicity， the gene expression profiles of an additional three well-characterized model agents were analyzed and a case study demonstrating the practical application of this genomic biomarker-based approach in risk assessment was performed to demonstrate its utility in genotoxicity risk assessment.Keywords:DNA-damage inducible; bioinformatics; stress genes; super-paramagnetic clustering.

Up-regulation of vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 gene in response to 5-fluorouracil in colon carcinoma SW620.,Oncol Rep, 2002 Jan-Feb,11748459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11748459/,Despite the wide use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for colon cancer， the genes regulating its cytotoxic effect are poorly understood. We used a high-density oligonucleotide microarray representing approximately 7000 genes to determine changes in gene expression caused by 5-FU treatment in the colon cancer cell line， SW620. The microarray showed that the most strongly up-regulated gene by 5-FU was vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1)， an interesting stress response gene， which was originally reported as a vitamin D3 inducible gene in HL-60. TaqMan RT-PCR assay confirmed that VDUP1 gene expression was significantly increased after 24 h of 5-FU treatment compared with untreated control (p<0.01). Moreover， the expression of vitamin D3 receptor， thymidylate synthase (TS)， and E2F1 did not change within 24 h of 5-FU treatment， suggesting a different gene-regulatory pathway from that of VDUP1. Recent studies have gradually clarified the potential role of VDUP1 via interaction with TRX in an anti-tumor effect. Therefore， VDUP1 not only may be induced by stress response as a result of 5-FU cytotoxicity， but may also play a key role in 5-FU cytotoxicity in colon cancers. Our experiment using a microarray and TaqMan RT-PCR assay， together with previous reports， provides new insight into a potential mechanism of 5-FU cytotoxicity.
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor independent proliferation of human glioblastoma cells: selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors lack antiproliferative activity.,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol, 2006 Sep,16736141,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16736141/,Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the role of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) in the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells as a prerequisite for a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of malignant brain tumors with selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib.Methods and results:In the human glioblastoma cell lines U-87 MG， U-118 MG and U-373 MG different PDGF and PDGFR mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR， and the expression of the receptor proteins was demonstrated by immunostaining and flow cytometry. Moreover， functional activity of PDGFRs was demonstrated in PDGFRbeta expressing glioblastoma cell variants by measuring the mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) upon PDGF-BB stimulation. However， addition of PDGF-BB to the serum-free culture medium had no stimulatory effect on cell proliferation. Furthermore， cell growth in serum-supplemented and serum-free medium was not affected by imatinib， leflunomide and AG-1296 at therapeutically relevant concentrations.Conclusion:Our results suggest that clinical antitumor effects of imatinib on glioblastoma， if any， are not mediated by the PDGFR.
Promotion of glioma cell survival by acyl-CoA synthetase 5 under extracellular acidosis conditions.,Oncogene, 2009 Jan 8,18806831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18806831/,Extracellular acidosis (low pH) is a tumor microenvironmental stressor that has a critical function in the malignant progression and metastatic dissemination of tumors. To survive under stress conditions， tumor cells must evolve resistance to stress-induced toxicity. Acyl-CoA synthetase 5 (ACSL5) is a member of the ACS family， which converts fatty acid to acyl-CoA. ACSL5 is frequently overexpressed in malignant glioma， whereas its functional significance is still unknown. Using retrovirus-mediated stable gene transfer (gain of function) and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing (loss of function)， we show here that ACSL5 selectively promotes human glioma cell survival under extracellular acidosis. ACSL5 enhanced cell survival through its ACS catalytic activity. To clarify the genome-wide changes in cell signaling pathways by ACSL5， we performed cDNA microarray analysis and identified an ACSL5-dependent gene expression signature. The analysis revealed that ACSL5 was critical to the expression of tumor-related factors including midkine (MDK)， a heparin-binding growth factor frequently overexpressed in cancer. Knockdown of MDK expression significantly attenuated ACSL5-mediated survival under acidic state. These results indicate that ACSL5 is a critical factor for survival of glioma cells under acidic tumor microenvironment， thus providing novel molecular basis for cancer therapy.
Effects of tobacco smoke on gene expression and cellular pathways in a cellular model of oral leukoplakia.,Cancer Prev Res (Phila), 2008 Jul,19138943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19138943/,In addition to being causally linked to the formation of multiple tumor types， tobacco use has been associated with decreased efficacy of anticancer treatment and reduced survival time. A detailed understanding of the cellular mechanisms that are affected by tobacco smoke (TS) should facilitate the development of improved preventive and therapeutic strategies. We have investigated the effects of a TS extract on the transcriptome of MSK-Leuk1 cells， a cellular model of oral leukoplakia. Using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2 arrays， 411 differentially expressed probe sets were identified. The observed transcriptome changes were grouped according to functional information and translated into molecular interaction network maps and signaling pathways. Pathways related to cellular proliferation， inflammation， apoptosis， and tissue injury seemed to be perturbed. Analysis of networks connecting the affected genes identified specific modulated molecular interactions， hubs， and key transcription regulators. Thus， TS was found to induce several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands forming an EGFR-centered molecular interaction network， as well as several aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent genes， including the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Notably， the latter findings in vitro are consistent with our parallel finding that CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 levels were increased in oral mucosa of smokers. Collectively， these results offer insights into the mechanisms underlying the procarcinogenic effects of TS and raise the possibility that inhibitors of EGFR or aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling will prevent or delay the development of TS-related tumors. Moreover， the inductive effects of TS on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes may help explain the reduced efficacy of chemotherapy， and suggest targets for chemopreventive agents in smokers.
An integrated genome-wide approach to discover deregulated microRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer: Clinical significance of miR-23b-3p deregulation.,Sci Rep, 2015 Aug 28,26314549,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26314549/,In spite of significant technical advances， genesis and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain poorly understood. We undertook an integrated genetic approach to discover novel microRNAs that were deregulated in NSCLCs. A total 119 primary NSCLCs with matched normal were analyzed for genome-wide copy number changes. We also tested a subset of matched samples by microRNA expression array， and integrated them to identify microRNAs positioned in allelic imbalance area. Our findings support that most of the identified deregulated microRNAs (miR-21， miR-23b， miR-31， miR-126， miR-150， and miR-205) were positioned in allelic imbalance areas. Among microRNAs tested in independent 114 NSCLCs， overexpression of miR-23b was revealed to be a significantly poor prognostic factor of recurrence free survival (HR = 2.40， P = 0.005， 95%CI: 1.32-4.29) and overall survival (HR = 2.35， P = 0.005， 95%CI: 1.30-4.19) in multivariable analysis. In addition， overexpression of miR-23b in H1838 cell line significantly increased cell proliferation， while inhibition of miR-23b in H1437 and H1944 cell lines significantly decreased cell doubling time. In summary， integration of genomic analysis and microRNA expression profiling could identify novel cancer-related microRNAs， and miR-23b could be a potential prognostic marker for early stage NSCLCs. Further biological studies of miR-23b are warranted for the potential development of targeted therapy.
Immune-based molecular subtyping of triple-negative breast cancer via SNF-CC and functional validation of key immune-associated genes.,Funct Integr Genomics, 2025 Jul 8,40627035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40627035/,Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents significant therapeutic challenges due to its aggressive nature and lack of targeted treatment options. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of immune infiltration patterns in TNBC progression and prognosis， yet a comprehensive classification system integrating immune and transcriptomic features remains elusive. In this study， we employed the xCell algorithm to characterize immune infiltration across TNBC samples and utilized the Similarity Network Fusion and Consensus Clustering (SNF-CC) method to identify molecular subtypes. Our analysis revealed three distinct TNBC subtypes with marked heterogeneity in transcriptomic profiles and immune microenvironment composition. Subtype 1 exhibited high immune infiltration， while Subtype 3 demonstrated immunosuppressive characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis linked subtype-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to pathways such as T-cell activation and cytokine signaling. Protein-protein interaction networks identified key hub genes (PTPRC， CD4， and UBE2C) showing elevated expression in TNBC tissues. Experimental validation in breast cancer cell lines confirmed that knockout of PTPRC， CD4， or UBE2C significantly impaired proliferation， migration， and invasion， while rescue experiments restored these oncogenic phenotypes. These findings establish an immune-based molecular subtyping framework for TNBC and uncover pivotal genes driving tumor progression. Our work provides novel insights into TNBC heterogeneity and identifies potential therapeutic targets for precision immunotherapy， advancing strategies to improve clinical outcomes in this recalcitrant malignancy.Keywords:CD4; Immune infiltration; Molecular subtyping; PTPRC; Triple-negative breast cancer; Tumor microenvironment; UBE2C.
Gene expression profiling in DQA1*0501+ children with untreated dermatomyositis: a novel model of pathogenesis.,J Immunol, 2002 Apr 15,11937576,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11937576/,Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)， the most common pediatric inflammatory myopathy， is a systemic vasculopathy affecting young children. Epidemiology studies documenting an antecedent illness in the 3 mo before the first definite symptom (rash and/or weakness) of JDM are supported by immunologic data that suggest that the disease pathophysiology is Ag driven. The purpose of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles in muscle biopsies of four untreated DQA1*0501(+) JDM children with profiles from children with a known necrotizing myopathy (Duchenne muscular dystrophy)， as well as an in vitro antiviral model (NF90)， and healthy pediatric controls. Nearly half (47%) of the dysregulated genes in JDM were associated with the immune response. In particular， increased expression of IFN-alphabeta-inducible genes 6-16， myxovirus resistance protein p78， latent cytosolic transcription factor， LMP2， and TAP1 was observed. This profile is consistent with an IFN-alphabeta transcription cascade seen in the in vitro viral resistance model. The IFN-alphabeta-inducible profile was superimposed on transcription profiles reflective of myofiber necrosis and regeneration shared with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (6-16)， immunofluorescence (thrombospondin 4)， and immunolocalization (IFN-gamma， p21). We hypothesize that these data support a model of Ag (?viral) induction of an apparent autoimmune disease based on dynamic interaction between the muscle， vascular， and immune systems in the genetically susceptible (DQA1*0501(+)) child.
Inhibitors of histone demethylation and histone deacetylation cooperate in regulating gene expression and inhibiting growth in human breast cancer cells.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2012 Feb,21452019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21452019/,normal activities of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and lysine deacetylases (HDACs) are associated with aberrant gene expression in breast cancer development. However， the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between KDMs and HDACs in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene transcription are still elusive. In this study， we showed that treatment of human breast cancer cells with inhibitors targeting the zinc cofactor dependent class I/II HDAC， but not NAD(+) dependent class III HDAC， led to significant increase of H3K4me2 which is a specific substrate of histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and a key chromatin mark promoting transcriptional activation. We also demonstrated that inhibition of LSD1 activity by a pharmacological inhibitor， pargyline， or siRNA resulted in increased acetylation of H3K9 (AcH3K9). However， siRNA knockdown of LSD2， a homolog of LSD1， failed to alter the level of AcH3K9， suggesting that LSD2 activity may not be functionally connected with HDAC activity. Combined treatment with LSD1 and HDAC inhibitors resulted in enhanced levels of H3K4me2 and AcH3K9， and exhibited synergistic growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Finally， microarray screening identified a unique subset of genes whose expression was significantly changed by combination treatment with inhibitors of LSD1 and HDAC. Our study suggests that LSD1 intimately interacts with histone deacetylases in human breast cancer cells. Inhibition of histone demethylation and deacetylation exhibits cooperation and synergy in regulating gene expression and growth inhibition， and may represent a promising and novel approach for epigenetic therapy of breast cancer.
Androgen receptor coregulators NOCR1， TIF2， and ARA70 may account for the hydroxyflutamide insensitivity of prostate cancer cells.,Ir J Med Sci, 2011 Dec,21748440,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21748440/,Introduction:Prostate cancer cells can switch from an androgen-dependent state to an androgen-independent state after a continuous androgen ablation therapy. However， the molecular mechanisms underlying this switch are still unclear. Therefore， we explored the change in androgen receptor (AR)-related gene expression during this transition in a novel cell model.Material and methods:Prostate cancer cells were continuously treated with competitive androgen receptor inhibitor hydroxyflutamide for 1.5 years， which yielded an flutamide-insensitive LNCaP subline， LNCaP-flu， as confirmed by MTT assays， flow cytometry， and electron microscopy. We analyzed the differences in gene expression in LNCaP-flu cells and LNCaP cells using gene chips and follow-up RT-PCR.Results:Over 2，428 genes were differentially expressed between these cell lines: 1，194 were down-regulated and 1，234 were up-regulated. Three genes in particular were considered related to the androgen-dependent transition: NCOR1， TIF2 (NCOA2)， and ARA70 (NCOA4). There were no apparent changes in expression of the androgen receptor or prostate-specific antigen.Conclusion:ARs and associated coregulators play a central role in the flutamide-insensitive transition of prostate cancer cells. Although AR expression does not change during this transition， the change in AR coregulators may be a critical factor in the development of antiandrogen insensitivity.
BET inhibitors combined with chemotherapy synergistically inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells.,Oncol Rep, 2021 May,33760217,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33760217/,The bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain (BET) family proteins are essential epigenetic regulators in lung cancer. However， BET inhibitors have not had the anticipated therapeutic efficacy. Combined treatment using BET inhibitors along with other drugs had favorable therapeutic effects but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antineoplastic effects and mechanisms of a combination of a BET inhibitor and paclitaxel or cisplatin in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). By using the online Kaplan‑Meier plotter， it was revealed that increased mRNA levels of several BET protein‑coding genes were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC. SRB assay results revealed that pharmaceutical or genetic targeting of BET proteins suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells. Inhibition of BET protein expression， in combination with the use of chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel and cisplatin， further restrained NSCLC cell growth in a synergistic manner. Mechanistically， this combination of suppression of BET expression and chemotherapeutic treatment blocked NSCLC cell growth by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis， which were revealed by both western blot and ELISA results. The present findings revealed a new rationale for using a combination of BET inhibitors with chemotherapy in NSCLC treatment.Keywords:non‑small cell lung cancer; bromodomain and extra‑terminal domain; chemotherapy; autophagy; apoptosis.
Molecular mechanisms of sorafenib action in liver cancer cells.,Cell Cycle, 2012 Aug 1,22801548,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22801548/,Sorafenib， a multikinase inhibitor， recently received FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However， as the clinical application of sorafenib evolves， there is increasing interest in defining the mechanisms underlying its anti-tumor activity. Considering that this specific inhibitor could target unexpected molecules depending on the biologic context， a precise understanding of its mechanism of action could be critical to maximize its treatment efficacy， while minimizing adverse effects. Two human HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7)， carrying different biological and genetic characteristics， were used in this study to examine the intracellular events leading to sorafenib-induced HCC cell-growth inhibition. Sorafenib inhibited cell growth in both cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner and significantly altered expression levels of 826 and 2011 transcripts in HepG2 and Huh7 cells， respectively. Genes functionally involved in angiogenesis， apoptosis， transcription regulation， signal transduction， protein biosynthesis and modification were predominantly upregulated， while genes implicated in cell cycle control， DNA replication recombination and repair， cell adhesion， metabolism and transport were mainly downregulated upon treatment. However， each sorafenib-treated HCC cell line displayed specificity in the expression and activity of crucial factors involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. The altered expression of some of these genes was confirmed by semiquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR and by western blotting. Many novel genes emerged from our transcriptomics analysis that had not previously been reported to be effected by sorafenib. Further functional analyses may determine whether these genes can serve as potential molecular targets for more effective anti-HCC strategies.
Analysis of the Indacaterol-Regulated Transcriptome in Human Airway Epithelial Cells Implicates Gene Expression Changes in the Adverse and Therapeutic Effects of beta(2)-Adrenoceptor Agonists.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2018 Jul,29653961,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29653961/,The contribution of gene expression changes to the adverse and therapeutic effects ofβ2-adrenoceptor agonists in asthma was investigated using human airway epithelial cells as a therapeutically relevant target. Operational model-fitting established that the long-actingβ2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) indacaterol， salmeterol， formoterol， and picumeterol were full agonists on BEAS-2B cells transfected with a cAMP-response element reporter but differed in efficacy (indacaterol ≥ formoterol > salmeterol ≥ picumeterol). The transcriptomic signature of indacaterol in BEAS-2B cells identified 180， 368， 252， and 10 genes that were differentially expressed (>1.5- to <0.67-fold) after 1-， 2-， 6-， and 18-hour of exposure， respectively. Many upregulated genes (e.g.，AREG，BDNF，CCL20，CXCL2，EDN1，IL6，IL15，IL20) encode proteins with proinflammatory activity and are annotated by several， enriched gene ontology (GO) terms， includingcellular response to interleukin-1，cytokine activity， andpositive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxisThe general enriched GO termextracellular spacewas also associated with indacaterol-induced genes， and many of those， includingCRISPLD2，DMBT1，GAS1，andSOCS3，have putative anti-inflammatory， antibacterial， and/or antiviral activity. Numerous indacaterol-regulated genes were also induced or repressed in BEAS-2B cells and human primary bronchial epithelial cells by the low efficacy LABA salmeterol， indicating that this genomic effect was neither unique to indacaterol nor restricted to the BEAS-2B airway epithelial cell line. Collectively， these data suggest that the consequences of inhaling aβ2-adrenoceptor agonist may be complex and involve widespread changes in gene expression. We propose that this genomic effect represents a generally unappreciated mechanism that may contribute to the adverse and therapeutic actions ofβ2-adrenoceptor agonists in asthma.
Anti-breast cancer synthetic peptides derived from the Anabas testudineus skin mucus fractions.,Sci Rep, 2021 Nov 30,34848729,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34848729/,Previous study has shown the antimicrobial activities of mucus protein extracted from Anabas testudineus. In this study， we are interested in characterizing the anticancer activity of the A. testudineus antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The mucus was extracted， fractioned， and subjected to antibacterial activity testing to confirm the fish's AMPs production. The cytotoxic activity of each fraction was also identified. Fraction 2 (F2)， which shows toxicity against MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were sent for peptide sequencing to identify the bioactive peptide. The two peptides were then synthetically produced and subjected to cytotoxic assay to prove their efficacy against cancer cell lines. The IC50for AtMP1 against MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were 8.25 ± 0.14 μg/ml and 9.35 ± 0.25 μg/ml respectively， while for AtMP2 it is 5.89 ± 0.14 μg/ml and 6.97 ± 0.24 μg/ml respectively. AtMP1 and AtMP2 treatment for 48 h induced breast cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by upregulating the p53， which lead to upregulate pro-apoptotic BAX gene and downregulate the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 gene， consequently， trigger the activation of the caspase-3. This interaction was supported by docking analysis (QuickDBD， HPEPDOCK， and ZDOCK) and immunoprecipitation. This study provided new prospects in the development of highly effective and selective cancer therapeutics based on antimicrobial peptides.
Targeting Innate Immunity for Antiviral Therapy through Small Molecule Agonists of the RLR Pathway.,J Virol, 2015 Dec 16,26676770,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676770/,The cellular response to virus infection is initiated when pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) engage viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This process results in induction of downstream signaling pathways that activate the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 plays a critical role in antiviral immunity to drive the expression of innate immune response genes， including those encoding antiviral factors， type 1 interferon， and immune modulatory cytokines， that act in concert to restrict virus replication. Thus， small molecule agonists that can promote IRF3 activation and induce innate immune gene expression could serve as antivirals to induce tissue-wide innate immunity for effective control of virus infection. We identified small molecule compounds that activate IRF3 to differentially induce discrete subsets of antiviral genes. We tested a lead compound and derivatives for the ability to suppress infections caused by a broad range of RNA viruses. Compound administration significantly decreased the viral RNA load in cultured cells that were infected with viruses of the family Flaviviridae， including West Nile virus， dengue virus， and hepatitis C virus， as well as viruses of the families Filoviridae (Ebola virus)， Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A virus)， Arenaviridae (Lassa virus)， and Paramyxoviridae (respiratory syncytial virus， Nipah virus) to suppress infectious virus production. Knockdown studies mapped this response to the RIG-I-like receptor pathway. This work identifies a novel class of host-directed immune modulatory molecules that activate IRF3 to promote host antiviral responses to broadly suppress infections caused by RNA viruses of distinct genera.Importance:Incidences of emerging and reemerging RNA viruses highlight a desperate need for broad-spectrum antiviral agents that can effectively control infections caused by viruses of distinct genera. We identified small molecule compounds that can selectively activate IRF3 for the purpose of identifying drug-like molecules that can be developed for the treatment of viral infections. Here， we report the discovery of a hydroxyquinoline family of small molecules that can activate IRF3 to promote cellular antiviral responses. These molecules can prophylactically or therapeutically control infection in cell culture by pathogenic RNA viruses， including West Nile virus， dengue virus， hepatitis C virus， influenza A virus， respiratory syncytial virus， Nipah virus， Lassa virus， and Ebola virus. Our study thus identifies a class of small molecules with a novel mechanism to enhance host immune responses for antiviral activity against a variety of RNA viruses that pose a significant health care burden and/or that are known to cause infections with high case fatality rates.
CXCR4， a potential predictive marker for docetaxel sensitivity in gastric cancer.,Anticancer Res, 2010 Jun,20651371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20651371/,The aim of this study was to explore predictive genes involved in docetaxel sensitivity of gastric cancer.Materials and methods:Microarray analysis was performed to explore various gene expression levels between parental and docetaxel-resistant cells. A panel of 11 genes selected according to microarray analysis were validated and tested further in 11 cancer cell lines， resulting in 4 genes， CXCR4， CDK6， USP15 and CDH1. Histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) was used to examine docetaxel sensitivity， while qRT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA levels of the genes in 25 surgically dissected gastric cancer specimens.Results:Only CXCR4 mRNA levels in gastric cancer tissues were correlated with docetaxel sensitivity (R(2)=0.23， p=0.019) and significantly higher in resistant specimens (p=0.038). AMD3100， a CXCR4 antagonist， enhanced the docetaxel cytotoxicity in vitro.Conclusion:CXCR4 mRNA expression levels may be a potential predictive biomarker in gastric cancer.

Expression profiles of a human pancreatic cancer cell line upon induction of apoptosis search for modulators in cancer therapy.,Oncology, 2004,15557790,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15557790/,We analyzed the differential gene expression in the pancreatic cancer cell line NP-18 upon induction of apoptosis caused by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition triggered by either overexpression of the tumor suppressor gene p16(INK4A)using an adenoviral construction or incubation with the chemical inhibitors， roscovitine or olomoucine. Screening was performed using cDNA arrays from Clontech that allowed the determination of the expression of 1，176 genes specifically related with cancer. The analysis was carried out using the Atlas Image 2.01 (Clontech) and GeneSpring 4.2 (Silicon Genetics) softwares. Among the differentially expressed genes， we chose for further validation histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)， von Hippel Lindau and decorin as upregulated genes， and Sp1， hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and DNA primase as downregulated genes. The changes in the expression of these genes to mRNA were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and the final translation into protein by Western blot analysis. Inhibition of HDAC activity， Sp1 binding and DNA primase expression led to an increase in the level of apoptosis， both in parental cells and in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Therefore， these proteins could constitute possible targets to develop modulators in cancer chemotherapy that would increase or restore apoptosis.
Inhibition of the mitochondrial pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by doxorubicin and brequinar sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.,Oncogene, 2014 Jul 3,24013224,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24013224/,Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising agent in selectively killing tumor cells. However， TRAIL monotherapy has not been successful as many cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL. Chemotherapeutic agents， such as doxorubicin have been shown to act synergistically with TRAIL， but the exact mechanisms of actions are poorly understood. In this study， we performed high-throughput small interfering RNA screening and genome-wide gene expression profiling on doxorubicin-treated U1690 cells to explore novel mechanisms underlying doxorubicin-TRAIL synergy. The screening and expression profiling results were integrated and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) was identified as a potential candidate. DHODH is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway， and its expression was downregulated by doxorubicin. We demonstrated that silencing of DHODH or inhibition of DHODH activity by brequinar dramatically increased the sensitivity of U1690 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis both in 2D and 3D cultures， and was accompanied by downregulation of c-FLIPL as well as by mitochondrial depolarization. In addition， uridine， an end product of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway was able to rescue the sensitization effects initiated by both brequinar and doxorubicin. Furthermore， several other cancer cell lines， LNCaP， MCF-7 and HT-29 were also shown to be sensitized to TRAIL by brequinar. Taken together， our findings have identified a novel protein target and its inhibitor， brequinar， as a potential agent in TRAIL-based combinatorial cancer therapy and highlighted for the first time the importance of mitochondrial DHODH enzyme and pyrimidine pathway in mediating TRAIL sensitization in cancer cells.
A gene expression signature of RAS pathway dependence predicts response to PI3K and RAS pathway inhibitors and expands the population of RAS pathway activated tumors.,BMC Med Genomics, 2010 Jun 30,20591134,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20591134/,Background:Hyperactivation of the Ras signaling pathway is a driver of many cancers， and RAS pathway activation can predict response to targeted therapies. Therefore， optimal methods for measuring Ras pathway activation are critical. The main focus of our work was to develop a gene expression signature that is predictive of RAS pathway dependence.Methods:We used the coherent expression of RAS pathway-related genes across multiple datasets to derive a RAS pathway gene expression signature and generate RAS pathway activation scores in pre-clinical cancer models and human tumors. We then related this signature to KRAS mutation status and drug response data in pre-clinical and clinical datasets.Results:The RAS signature score is predictive of KRAS mutation status in lung tumors and cell lines with high (> 90%) sensitivity but relatively low (50%) specificity due to samples that have apparent RAS pathway activation in the absence of a KRAS mutation. In lung and breast cancer cell line panels， the RAS pathway signature score correlates with pMEK and pERK expression， and predicts resistance to AKT inhibition and sensitivity to MEK inhibition within both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type groups. The RAS pathway signature is upregulated in breast cancer cell lines that have acquired resistance to AKT inhibition， and is downregulated by inhibition of MEK. In lung cancer cell lines knockdown of KRAS using siRNA demonstrates that the RAS pathway signature is a better measure of dependence on RAS compared to KRAS mutation status. In human tumors， the RAS pathway signature is elevated in ER negative breast tumors and lung adenocarcinomas， and predicts resistance to cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer.Conclusions:These data demonstrate that the RAS pathway signature is superior to KRAS mutation status for the prediction of dependence on RAS signaling， can predict response to PI3K and RAS pathway inhibitors， and is likely to have the most clinical utility in lung and breast tumors.
Regulation of anti-tumorigenic pathways by the combinatory treatment of calcitriol and TGF-β in PC-3 and DU145 cells.,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol, 2021 May,33582304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33582304/,Calcitriol and transforming growth factors beta (TGF-β) are involved in several biological pathways such as cell proliferation， differentiation， migration and invasion. Their cellular effects could be similar or opposite depending on the genetic target， cell type and context. Despite the reported association of calcitriol deficiency and disruption of the TGF-β pathway in prostate cancer and the well-known independent effects of calcitriol and TGF-βs on cancer cells， there is limited information regarding the cellular effects of calcitriol and TGF-β in combination. In this study， we in vitro analyze the combinatory effects of calcitriol and TGF-β on cell growth and apoptosis using PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines. Using high-throughput microarray profiling of PC-3 cells upon independent and combinatory treatments， we identified distinct transcriptional landscapes of each intervention， with a higher effect established by the combinatorial treatment， following by TGF-β1 and later by calcitriol. A set of genes and enriched pathways converge among the treatments， mainly between the combinatory scheme and TGF-β1， but the majority were treatment-specific. Of note， CYP24A1， IGFBP3， CDKN1A， NOX4 and UBE2D3 were significantly up-regulated upon the combinatorial treatment whereas CCNA1， members of the CT45A and APOBEC3 family were down-regulated. By public RNA signatures， we were able to confirm the regulation by the co-treatment over cell proliferation and cell cycle. We finally investigated the possible clinical impact of genes modulated by the combinatorial treatment using benchmark prostate cancer data. This comprehensive analysis reveals that the combinatory treatment impairs cell growth without affecting apoptosis and their combinatory actions might synergize and improved their individual effects to reprogram prostate cancer signaling.Keywords:CCNA1; CDKN1A; CT45A2; Calcitriol; IGFBP3; Microarray; Prostate cancer cells; TGF-β; UBE2D3.
Mechanisms operative in the antitumor activity of temozolomide in glioblastoma multiforme.,Cancer J, 2007 Sep-Oct,17921733,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17921733/,Purpose:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and incurable brain tumor in adults. Although temozolomide (TMZ) does not cure GBM， it has demonstrated anti-GBM activity and has improved survival (8-14 months) and quality of life. We studied the mechanisms by which TMZ affects 2 human GBM cell lines; U251-MG and U87-MG， aiming to unravel the drug-activated cascades to enable the development of combination therapies that will improve the efficacy of TMZ.Materials and methods:The 3-(4，5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2，5-diphenyltetrazolium assay was used to assess cell viability. Modulation of gene expression by TMZ therapy was assayed by gene profiling and verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels influenced by the treatment were studied by Western blots and immunocytochemistry.Results:Increasing concentrations of TMZ decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. The expression of 1，886 genes was altered >2-fold after TMZ treatment. We focused on the 81 genes similarly altered by TMZ treatment in both cell lines to neutralize tissue-specific characteristics. Fourteen target genes of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1)， were found to be up-regulated after TMZ treatment including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HIF-1alpha expression was constant at the mRNA level; however， its post-treatment protein levels increased compared with those of untreated control cells.Discussion:The genetic analyses suggest that treatment with TMZ activates stress mechanisms in GBM cells that include the angiogenesis-inducing proteins HIF-1alpha and VEGF. We propose that treatment with TMZ be supplemented with either an antibody to VEGF or down-regulators of HIF-1alpha to improve clinical results of TMZ in the treatment of GBM.
Neighbors' death is required for surviving human adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells in an early stage of gefitinib treatment.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2016 Oct 14,27659708,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27659708/,quired drug resistance is a major problem in chemotherapy， and understanding of the mechanism， by which naïve cells defend themselves from drugs when the cells exposed to the drugs for the first time， may provide a solution of the problem. Gefitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor， and used as an anticancer drug; however， gefitinib treatment may sometimes lead cancer cells gradually into a gefitinib-tolerance. Here we describe that human adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells even under the presence of gefitinib were able to survive by activating another signaling pathway involving fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and its signaling molecule， FGF2; and further suggest that the FGF2 for initiating the pathway might be supplied from neighboring cells which were killed by gefitinib， i.e.， the survival might be founded on neighbors' sacrifice in an early stage of gefitinib treatment. Our findings suggested that whether cells had a chance to encounter to survival factors such as FGF2 soon after gefitinib treatment might be an important crossroads for the cells for survival and for gaining a gefitinib tolerance.Keywords:Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); FGF2; Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR); Gefitinib; Gefitinib resistance; PC-9 cells.
Comparative analysis of iPSC-derived NK cells from two differentiation strategies reveals distinct signatures and cytotoxic activities.,Front Immunol, 2024 Oct 9,39445004,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39445004/,"Purpose:The ability to generate natural killer (NK) cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has given rise to new possibilities for the large-scale production of homogeneous immunotherapeutic cellular products and opened new avenues towards the creation of ""off-the-shelf"" cancer immunotherapies. However， the differentiation of NK cells from iPSCs remains poorly understood， particularly regarding the ontogenic landscape of iPSC-derived NK (iNK) cells producedin vitroand the influence that the differentiation strategy employed may have on the iNK profile.Methods:To investigate this question， we conducted a comparative analysis of two sets of iNK cells generated from the same iPSC line using two different protocols: (i) a short-term， clinically compatible feeder-free protocol corresponding to primitive hematopoiesis， and (ii) a lymphoid-based protocol representing the definitive hematopoietic step.Results and discussion:Our work demonstrated that both protocols are capable of producing functional iNK cells. However， the two sets of resulting iNKs exhibited distinct phenotypes and transcriptomic profiles. The lymphoid-based differentiation approach generated iNKs with a more mature and activated profile， which demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines compared to iNK cells produced under short-term feeder-free conditions suggesting that the differentiation strategy must be considered when designing iNK cell-based adoptive immunotherapies.Keywords:feeder-free differentiation; immunotherapy; induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC); lymphoid-based differentiation; natural killer (NK)."
Invasive markers identified by gene expression profiling in pancreatic cancer.,Pancreatology, 2012 Mar-Apr,22487523,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22487523/,Background:Molecular profiling has proven utility as a diagnostic and predictive tool in clinical oncology. However， a clinically relevant gene expression profile in pancreatic cancer remains elusive.Methods:Primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3 and AsPC-1)， were stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)， a known inducer of cell invasion. Affymetrix gene expression microarray analysis was performed， comparing gene expression to unstimulated controls. Differential expression was identified using ArrayAssist， and confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using Pathway Studio and GOstat. The derived gene expression was further validated in fresh frozen pancreatic tumour samples. The ability of the derived 3 gene expression markersto differentiate between pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other neoplasms， and its association with clinicopathological variables was examined.Results:PMA-induced significant changes in cell line gene expression， from which distinctive 3 potential invasive markers were derived. Expression of these genes， uPA， MMP-1 and IL1-R1 was confirmed in human pancreatic tumours， and was found to differentiate PDAC from other pancreatic neoplasms. The expression of IL1-R1 in PDAC is a novel finding. We found that the expression of MMP-1 was associated with high-grade PDAC (p = 0.035， Wilcoxon rank sum).Conclusion:We have identified three potential invasive markers， uPA， MMP-1 and IL1-R1， whose gene expression may differentiate PDAC from other pancreatic neoplasms， and potentially reflect a more invasive phenotype.

Integrated molecular analysis of Tamoxifen-resistant invasive lobular breast cancer cells identifies MAPK and GRM/mGluR signaling as therapeutic vulnerabilities.,Mol Cell Endocrinol, 2018 Aug 15,28935545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28935545/,Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is an understudied malignancy with distinct clinical， pathological， and molecular features that distinguish it from the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Mounting evidence suggests that estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ER+) ILC has a poor response to Tamoxifen (TAM)， but the mechanistic drivers of this are undefined. In the current work， we comprehensively characterize the SUM44/LCCTam ILC cell model system through integrated analysis of gene expression， copy number， and mutation， with the goal of identifying actionable alterations relevant to clinical ILC that can be co-targeted along with ER to improve treatment outcomes. We show that TAM has several distinct effects on the transcriptome of LCCTam cells， that this resistant cell model has acquired copy number alterations and mutations that impinge on MAPK and metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM/mGluR) signaling networks， and that pharmacological inhibition of either improves or restores the growth-inhibitory actions of endocrine therapy.Keywords:ESRRG (ERRgamma); Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC); MAPK/ERK (MAPK1); Riluzole; Tamoxifen resistance; mGluR (GRM).
High expression levels of total IGF-1R and sensitivity of NSCLC cells in vitro to an anti-IGF-1R antibody (R1507).,PLoS One, 2009 Oct 6,19806209,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19806209/,Background:The IGF receptor type 1 (IGF-1R) pathway is frequently deregulated in human tumors and has become a target of interest for anti-cancer therapy.Methodology/principal findings:We used a panel of 22 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to investigate predictive biomarkers of response to R1507， a fully-humanized anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody (Ab; Roche). 5 lines were moderately sensitive (25-50% growth inhibition) to R1507 alone. While levels of phospho-IGF-1R did not correlate with drug sensitivity， 4 out of 5 sensitive lines displayed high levels of total IGF-1R versus 1 out of 17 resistant lines (p = 0.003， Fisher's Exact). Sensitive lines also harbored higher copy numbers of IGF-1R as assessed by independent SNP array analysis. Addition of erlotinib or paclitaxel to R1507 led to further growth inhibition in sensitive but not resistant lines. In one EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line (11-18)， R1507 and erlotinib co-treatment induced apoptosis， whereas treatment with either drug alone induced only cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was mediated， in part， by the survival-related AKT pathway. Additionally， immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of total IGF-1R with an anti-total IGF-1R Ab (G11;Ventana) was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 270 independent NSCLC tumor samples. Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to 3+. 39.3% of tumors showed medium to high IGF-1R IHC staining (scores of 2+ or 3+， respectively)， while 16.7% had scores of 3+.Conclusions/significance:In NSCLC cell lines， high levels of total IGF-1R are associated with moderate sensitivity to R1507. These results suggest a possible enrichment strategy for clinical trials with anti-IGF-1R therapy.

Expression profile of mRNAs and miRNAs related to mitogen-activated kinases in HaCaT cell culture treated with lipopolysaccharide a and adalimumab.,Cell Cycle, 2024 Feb,38557266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38557266/,Studies indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) exhibit activation and overexpression within psoriatic lesions. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the expression patterns of genes encoding MAPKs and microRNA (miRNA) molecules that potentially regulate their expression in human adult low-calcium high-temperature (HaCaT) keratinocytes when exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide A (LPS) and adalimumab. HaCaT cells underwent treatment with 1 µg/mL LPS for 8 hours， followed by treatment with 8 µg/mL adalimumab for 2， 8， or 24 hours. Untreated cells served as controls.

It was noted that miR-34a may potentially regulate the activity ofDUSP1，DUSP3， andDUSP4， while miR-1275 is implicated in regulatingMAPK9expression. Additionally， miR-382 and miR-3188 are potential regulators ofDUSP4levels， and miR-200-5p is involved in regulatingMAPKAPK2andMAP3K2levels. Thus， the analysis showed that these mRNA molecules and the proteins and miRNAs they encode appear to be useful molecular markers for monitoring the efficacy of adalimumab therapy.Keywords:Mitogen-activated protein kinases; adalimumab; lipopolysaccharides.
VISAGE Reveals a Targetable Mitotic Spindle Vulnerability in Cancer Cells.,Cell Syst, 2019 Jul 24,31302152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302152/,There is an unmet need for new antimitotic drug combinations that target cancer-specific vulnerabilities. Based on our finding of elevated biomolecule oxidation in mitotically arrested cancer cells， we combined Plk1 inhibitors with TH588， an MTH1 inhibitor that prevents detoxification of oxidized nucleotide triphosphates. This combination showed robust synergistic killing of cancer， but not normal， cells that， surprisingly， was MTH1-independent. To dissect the underlying synergistic mechanism， we developed VISAGE， a strategy integrating experimental synergy quantification with computational-pathway-based gene expression analysis. VISAGE predicted， and we experimentally confirmed， that this synergistic combination treatment targeted the mitotic spindle. Specifically， TH588 binding to β-tubulin impaired microtubule assembly， which when combined with Plk1 blockade， synergistically disrupted mitotic chromosome positioning to the spindle midzone. These findings identify a cancer-specific mitotic vulnerability that is targetable using Plk1 inhibitors with microtubule-destabilizing agents and highlight the general utility of the VISAGE approach to elucidate molecular mechanisms of drug synergy.Keywords:MTH1; Plk1; TH588; anti-microtubule drugs; cancer therapy; chromosome alignment; chromosome congression; drug synergy; mitosis; tubulin.

Identification of novel target genes of nerve growth factor (NGF) in human mastocytoma cell line (HMC-1 (V560G c-Kit)) by transcriptome analysis.,BMC Genomics, 2011 Apr 18,21501463,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21501463/,Background:Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a potent growth factor that plays a key role in neuronal cell differentiation and may also play a role in hematopoietic differentiation. It has been shown that NGF induced synergistic action for the colony formation of CD34 positive hematopoietic progenitor cells treated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1)， or stem cell factor (SCF). However， the exact role of NGF in hematopoietic system is unclear. It is also not clear whether NGF mediated signals in hematopoietic cells are identical to those in neuronal cells.Results:To study the signal transduction pathways induced by NGF treatment in hematopoietic cells， we utilized the mastocytoma cell line HMC-1(V560G c-Kit) which expresses the NGF receptor， tropomyosin-receptor-kinase (Trk)A， as well as the constitutively activated SCF receptor， V560G c-Kit， which can be inhibited completely by treatment with the potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib). NGF rescues HMC-1(V560G c-Kit) cells from imatinib mediated cell death and promotes proliferation. To examine the NGF mediated proliferation and survival in these cells， we compared the NGF mediated upregulated genes (30 and 120 min after stimulation) to the downregulated genes by imatinib treatment (downregulation of c-Kit activity for 4 h) by transcriptome analysis. The following conclusions can be drawn from the microarray data: Firstly， gene expression profiling reveals 50% overlap of genes induced by NGF-TrkA with genes expressed downstream of V560G c-Kit. Secondly， NGF treatment does not enhance expression of genes involved in immune related functions that were down regulated by imatinib treatment. Thirdly， more than 55% of common upregulated genes are involved in cell proliferation and survival. Fourthly， we found Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 2 and Smad family member 7 (SMAD7) as the NGF mediated novel downstream genes in hematopoietic cells. Finally， the downregulation of KLF2 gene enhanced imatinib induced apoptosis.Conclusion:NGF does not induce genes which are involved in immune related functions， but induces proliferation and survival signals in HMC-1(V560G c-Kit) cells. Furthermore， the current data provide novel candidate genes， KLF2 and SMAD7 which are induced by NGF/TrkA activation in hematopoietic cells. Since the depletion of KLF2 causes enhanced apoptosis of HMC-1(V560G c-Kit)， KLF2 may play a role in the NGF mediated survival signal.

Exploring Ovarian Cancer Cell Resistance to Rhenium Anticancer Complexes.,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl, 2020 Aug 3,32396709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32396709/,Rhenium tricarbonyl complexes have been recently investigated as novel anticancer agents. However， little is understood about their mechanisms of action， as well as the means by which cancer cells respond to chronic exposure to these compounds. To gain a deeper mechanistic insight into these rhenium anticancer agents， we developed and characterized an ovarian cancer cell line that is resistant to a previously studied compound [Re(CO)3(dmphen)(ptolICN)]+， where dmphen=2，9-dimethyl-1，10-phenanthroline and ptolICN=para-tolyl isonitrile， called TRIP. This TRIP-resistant ovarian cancer cell line， A2780TR， was found to be 9 times less sensitive to TRIP compared to the wild-type A2780 ovarian cancer cell line. Furthermore， the cytotoxicities of established drugs and other rhenium anticancer agents in the TRIP-resistant cell line were determined. Notably， the drug taxol was found to exhibit a 184-fold decrease in activity in the A2780TR cell line， suggesting that mechanisms of resistance towards TRIP and this drug are similar. Accordingly， expression levels of the ATP-binding cassette transporter P-glycoprotein， an efflux transporter known to detoxify taxol， were found to be elevated in the A2780TR cell line. Additionally， a gene expression analysis using the National Cancer Institute 60 cell line panel identified the MT1E gene to be overexpressed in cells that are less sensitive to TRIP. Because this gene encodes for metallothioneins， this result suggests that detoxification by this class of proteins is another mechanism for resistance to TRIP. The importance of this gene in the A2780TR cell line was assessed， confirming that its expression is elevated in this cell line as well. As the first study to investigate and identify the cancer cell resistance pathways in response to a rhenium complex， this report highlights important similarities and differences in the resistance responses of ovarian cancer cells to TRIP and conventional drugs.Keywords:bioinorganic chemistry; cancer; drug resistance; gene expression; rhenium.

Human dendritic cell maturation and activation by a heat-killed recombinant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) vector encoding carcinoembryonic antigen.,Vaccine, 2009 Feb 11,19110021,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19110021/,Tumor-associated antigens are weakly immunogenic. Human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is overexpressed on a wide range of human carcinomas and represents an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. This study analyzes the ability of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae vector containing the transgene encoding CEA (yeast-CEA) to activate human dendritic cells (DCs) and stimulate CEA-specific T-cell responses. We demonstrate for the first time that treatment with yeast-CEA can activate human DCs， resulting in increases in surface expression of CD80， CD83， CD54， CD58， and MHC class II， and increased production by DCs of IL-12p70， TNF-alpha， IFN-gamma， IL-8， IL-2， IL-13， IL-10， and IL-1beta. We also show that human DCs treated with yeast-CEA can activate CEA-specific T-cell lines and can act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to generate CEA-specific T-cell lines capable of lysing CEA(+) human tumor cells. Gene expression profiles of human DCs treated with yeast-CEA show increased expression of numerous genes involved in the production of chemokines and cytokines and their receptors， and genes related to antigen uptake， antigen presentation， and signal transduction.
Albumin activates ERK via EGF receptor in human renal epithelial cells.,J Am Soc Nephrol, 2005 May,15829704,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15829704/,Emerging clinical and experimental evidence strongly implicates proteinuria in the progression of kidney disease. One pathway involves the activation of NFkappaB by albumin， and it has been demonstrated that the activation of NFkappaB induced by albumin is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/ERK2. To study the effect of albumin on gene expression， primary human renal tubular cells were exposed in vitro to albumin (1%) for 6 h， and gene expression profiling was performed with the human oligonucleotide microarray， U133A Affymetrix Gene Chip. In all， 223 genes were differentially regulated by albumin， including marked upregulation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and IL-8. Accordingly， the authors sought to delineate the signaling pathway linking albumin to the EGFR and activation of ERK1/ERK2. It was found that albumin led to a dose- and time-dependent activation of ERK1/ERK2. Treatment with albumin led to EGFR phosphorylation， but the activation of ERK1/ERK2 was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with AG-1478， the EGFR kinase inhibitor， at a dose that inhibited EGF-induced ERK1/ERK2 activation. Exogenously administered reactive oxygen species (ROS) were found to activate ERK1/ERK2 via the EGFR and src tyrosine kinase activity and pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI abrogated albumin-induced activation of ERK1/ERK2. The src tyrosine kinase inhibitor， PP2， also inhibited the albumin-induced activation of ERK1/ERK2. Finally， pretreatment with AG-1478， the MEK inhibitor UO126， and NAC prevented the albumin-induced increase in IL-8 expression. The authors conclude that the EGF receptor plays a central role in the signaling pathway that links albumin to the activation of ERK1/ERK2 and increased expression of IL-8. Gene profiling studies suggest that there may be a positive feedback loop through the EGFR that amplifies the response of the proximal tubule cell to albumin. Taken together， these results suggest that the EGFR may be an important treatment target for kidney disease associated with proteinuria.
Overexpression of neuropilin-1 promotes constitutive MAPK signalling and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer cells.,Br J Cancer, 2005 Jul 25,15956974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15956974/,Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a novel co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Neuropilin-1 is expressed in pancreatic cancer， but not in nonmalignant pancreatic tissue. We hypothesised that NRP-1 expression by pancreatic cancer cells contributes to the malignant phenotype. To determine the role of NRP-1 in pancreatic cancer， NRP-1 was stably transfected into the human pancreatic cancer cell line FG. Signal transduction was assessed by Western blot analysis. Susceptibility to anoikis (detachment induced apoptosis) was evaluated by colony formation after growth in suspension. Chemosensitivity to gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was assessed by MTT assay in pancreatic cancer cells following NRP-1 overexpression or siRNA-induced downregulation of NRP-1. Differential expression of apoptosis-related genes was determined by gene array and further evaluated by Western blot analysis. Neuropilin-1 overexpression increased constitutive mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling， possibly via an autocrine loop. Neuropilin-1 overexpression in FG cells enhanced anoikis resistance and increased survival of cells by > 30% after exposure to clinically relevant levels of gemcitabine and 5-FU. In contrast， downregulation of NRP-1 expression in Panc-1 cells markedly increased chemosensitivity， inducing > 50% more cell death at clinically relevant concentrations of gemcitabine. Neuropilin-1 overexpression also increased expression of the antiapoptotic regulator， MCL-1. Neuropilin-1 overexpression in pancreatic cancer cell lines is associated with (a) increased constitutive MAPK signalling， (b) inhibition of anoikis， and (c) chemoresistance. Targeting NRP-1 in pancreatic cancer cells may downregulate survival signalling pathways and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy.
The Function of Oncogene B-Cell Lymphoma 6 in the Regulation of the Migration and Invasion of Trophoblastic Cells.,Int J Mol Sci, 2020 Nov 9,33182312,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33182312/,Human placentation is a highly invasive process. Deficiency in the invasiveness of trophoblasts is associated with a spectrum of gestational diseases， such as preeclampsia (PE). The oncogene B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is involved in the migration and invasion of various malignant cells. Intriguingly， its expression is deregulated in preeclamptic placentas. We have reported that BCL6 is required for the proliferation， survival， fusion， and syncytialization of trophoblasts. In the present work， we show that the inhibition of BCL6， either by its gene silencing or by using specific small molecule inhibitors， impairs the migration and invasion of trophoblastic cells， by reducing cell adhesion and compromising the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover， the suppression of BCL6 weakens the signals of the phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase， Akt/protein kinase B， and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2， accompanied by more stationary， but less migratory， cells. Interestingly， transcriptomic analyses reveal that a small interfering RNA-induced reduction of BCL6 decreases the levels of numerous genes， such as p21 activated kinase 1， myosin light chain kinase， and gamma actin related to cell adhesion， actin dynamics， and cell migration. These data suggest BCL6 as a crucial player in the migration and invasion of trophoblasts in the early stages of placental development through the regulation of various genes associated with the migratory machinery.Keywords:BCL6; actin dynamics; cell and focal adhesion; migration and invasion; trophoblast.
Molecular and biochemical mining of heat-shock and 14-3-3 proteins in drug-induced protoscolices of Echinococcus granulosus and the detection of a candidate gene for anthelmintic resistance.,J Helminthol, 2011 Jun,20735897,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20735897/,Cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus is a disease that affects both humans and animals. In humans the disease is treated by surgery with a supplementary option of chemotherapy with a benzimidazole compound. During the present study heat-shock protein 60 (HSP 60) was identified as one of the most frequently expressed biomolecules by E. granulosus after albendazole treatment. Data were correlated with 14-3-3 protein signature， and overexpression of this molecule after albendazole induction was an indicator of cell survival and signal transduction during in vitro maintenance of E. granulosus for up to 72 h. This observation was further correlated with a uniform expression pattern of a housekeeping gene (actin II). Out of three β-tubulin gene isoforms of E. granulosus， β-tubulin gene isoform 2 showed a conserved point mutation indicative of benzimidazole resistance.
Identification of carbonic anhydrase 9 as a contributor to pingyangmycin-induced drug resistance in human tongue cancer cells.,FEBS J, 2010 Nov,21040473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21040473/,Drug resistance is the major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. To understand the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in tongue cancer， Tca8113 cells derived from moderately differentiated human tongue squamous cell carcinoma were exposed to stepwise escalated concentrations of pingyangmycin (PYM) to develop the resistant cell line called Tca8113/PYM， which showed over 18.78-fold increased resistance to PYM as compared with Tca8113 cells， and cross-resistance to cisplatin， pirarubicin， paclitaxel， adriamycin， and mitomycin. We found that the resistance was not associated with multidrug resistance transporter 1 (p170， p-gp)， multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein overexpression， so we hypothesized that Tca8113/PYM cells must have some other resistance mechanism selected by PYM. To test this hypothesis， the global gene expression profiles between Tca8113 and Tca8113/PYM cells were compared by cDNA microarray. Eighty-nine genes and thirteen expressed sequence tags with differential expression levels between the two cell lines were identified. Some differential expression levels were validated with real-time PCR and western blot. Furthermore， the functional validation showed that both carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide application and CA9 silencing with CA9 antisense oligonucleotides contribute to the medium pH increase of Tca8113/PYM cells and enhanced PYM chemosensitivity. Moreover， both acetazolamide and CA9 antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased PYM-induced caspase 3 activation in Tca8113/PYM cells. Thus， our study suggests that the resistance of Tca8113/PYM cells is probably associated with CA9 and other differential expression molecules， and that CA9 may be an important marker for prediction of PYM responsiveness in tongue cancer chemotherapy.
Integrated genomic， transcriptomic， and RNA-interference analysis of genes in somatic copy number gains in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,Pancreas, 2013 Aug,23851435,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23851435/,Objectives:This study used an integrated analysis of copy number， gene expression， and RNA interference screens for identification of putative driver genes harbored in somatic copy number gains in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Methods:Somatic copy number gain data on 60 PDAC genomes were extracted from public data sets to identify genomic loci that are recurrently gained. Array-based data from a panel of 29 human PDAC cell lines were used to quantify associations between copy number and gene expression for the set of genes found in somatic copy number gains. The most highly correlated genes were assessed in a compendium of pooled short hairpin RNA screens on 27 of the same human PDAC cell lines.Results:A catalog of 710 protein-coding and 46 RNA genes mapping to 20 recurrently gained genomic loci were identified. The gene set was further refined through stringent integration of copy number， gene expression， and RNA interference screening data to uncover 34 candidate driver genes.Conclusions:Among the candidate genes from the integrative analysis， ECT2 was found to have significantly higher essentiality in specific PDAC cell lines with genomic gains at the 3q26.3 locus， which harbors this gene， suggesting that ECT2 may play an oncogenic role in the PDAC neoplastic process.
Pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modifications， coupled with gene expression profiling， reveals novel targets of aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in lung cancer.,Oncogene, 2007 Apr 19,17043644,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17043644/,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States due， in large part， to the lack of early detection methods. Lung cancer arises from a complex series of genetic and epigenetic changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Unlike genetic changes， epigenetic changes， such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation， are reversible with currently available pharmaceuticals and are early events in lung tumorigenesis detectable by non-invasive methods. In order to better understand how epigenetic changes contribute to lung cancer， and to identify new disease biomarkers， we combined pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines， with genome-wide expression profiling. Of the more than 200 genes upregulated by these treatments， three of these， neuronatin， metallothionein 3 and cystatin E/M， were frequently hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors. Interestingly， four other genes， cylindromatosis， CD9， activating transcription factor 3 and oxytocin receptor， were dominantly regulated by histone deacetylation and were also frequently downregulated in lung tumors. The majority of these genes also suppressed NSCLC growth in culture when ectopically expressed. This study therefore reveals new putative NSCLC growth regulatory genes and epigenetic disease biomarkers that may enhance early detection strategies and serve as therapeutic targets.
Growth inhibition of estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cells by Taheebo from the inner bark of Tabebuia avellandae tree.,Int J Mol Med, 2009 Aug,19578798,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19578798/,Selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators are used as a therapy for ER+ clinical breast cancer， but they exhibit adverse effects. Herbal medicines may provide an alternative or complementary approach. Taheebo， extracted from the inner bark of the Tabebuia avellandae tree found in the Brazilian Amazon， exhibits selective anti-proliferative effects in carcinoma cell lines. The present study identifies the mechanistic leads for the inhibitory effects of Taheebo. Human breast carcinoma derived ER+MCF-7 cells were used as the model. Aqueous extract of Taheebo was the test compound. Cell cycle analysis， clonogenic assay， and global gene expression profiles were the quantitative parameters. Taheebo treatment resulted in a dose/time-dependent growth inhibition (S phase arrest， reduced clonogeneticity) and initiation of apoptosis (chromatin condensation). A 6-h treatment with 1.5 mg/ml Taheebo modulated the gene expression of G2 specific cyclin B1 (-2.0-fold); S phase specific PCNA (-2.0-fold) and OKL38 (+11.0-fold); apoptosis specific GADD-45 family (+1.9-5.4-fold)， Caspases (+1.6-1.7-fold)， BCL-2 family (-1.5-2.5-fold)， estrogen responsive ESR1 (-1.5-fold)， and xeno-biotic metabolism specific CYP 1A1 (+19.8 fold) and CYP 1B1 (+7.9-fold). The anti-proliferative effects of Taheebo correlate with down-regulated cell cycle regulatory and estrogen responsive genes， and up-regulated apoptosis specific and xeno-biotic metabolism specific genes. These data validate a rapid mechanistic approach to prioritize efficacious herbal medicines， thereby complementing the existing endocrine therapy for breast cancer.
Effects of resveratrol on gene expression in renal cell carcinoma.,Cancer Biol Ther, 2004 Sep,15280659,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15280659/,Studies have shown that Resveratrol (RE) can inhibit cancer initiation， promotion， and progression. However the gene expression profile in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in response to RE treatment has never been reported. To understand the potential anticancer effect of RE on RCC at molecular level， we profiled and analyzed the expression of 2059 cancer-related genes in a RCC cell line RCC54 treated with RE. Biological functions of 633 genes were annotated based on biological process ontology and clustered into functional categories. Twenty-nine highly differentially expressed genes in RE treated RCC54 were identified and the potential implications of some gene expression alterations in RCC carcinogenesis were identified. RE was also shown to inhibit cell growth and induce cell death of RCC cells. The expression alterations of selected genes were validated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition， the gene expression profiles under different RE treatments were analyzed and visualized using singular value decomposition. The findings from this study support the hypothesis that RE induces differential expression of genes that are directly or indirectly related to the inhibition of RCC cell growth and induction of RCC cell death. In addition， it is apparent that the gene expression alterations due to RE treatment depend strongly on RE concentration. This study provides a general understanding of the overall genetic response of RCC54 to RE treatment and yields insights into the understanding of the cancer preventive mechanism of RE in RCC.
Anti-angiogenic effects of the water extract of HangAmDan (WEHAD)， a Korean traditional medicine.,Sci China Life Sci, 2011 Mar,21416324,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21416324/,We investigated the anti-angiogenic effects of the water extract of HangAmDan (WEHAD)， which is a crude extract of nine Korean medicinal substances of animal and plant origin. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells， WEHAD significantly inhibited bFGF-induced proliferation， adhesion， migration， and capillary tube formation. We used an antibody array to perform an analysis of signaling proteins， which showed up-regulated expression of various proteins including RAD51， RAD52， and p73， and down-regulated expression of pFAK. Blood vessel formation in a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) treated with WEHAD was markedly reduced in length compared with a PBS-treated control group. These results suggest that inhibition of angiogenesis by WEHAD may be the mechanism of action for the anti-cancer effects of HAD.
Oxalate upregulates expression of IL-2Rbeta and activates IL-2R signaling in HK-2 cells， a line of human renal epithelial cells.,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol, 2014 May 1,24523387,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24523387/,The role of inflammation in oxalate-induced nephrolithiasis is debated. Our gene expression study indicated an increase in interleukin-2 receptor β (IL-2Rβ) mRNA in response to oxalate (Koul S， Khandrika L， Meacham RB， Koul HK. PLoS ONE 7: e43886， 2012). Herein， we evaluated IL-2Rβ expression and its downstream signaling pathway in HK-2 cells in an effort to understand the mechanisms of oxalate nephrotoxicity. HK-2 cells were exposed to oxalate for various time points in the presence or absence of SB203580， a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor. Gene expression data were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. mRNA expression was quantitated via real-time PCR， and changes in protein expression/kinase activation were analyzed by Western blotting. Exposure of HK-2 cells to oxalate resulted in increased transcription of IL-2Rβ mRNA and increased protein levels. Oxalate treatment also activated the IL-2Rβ signaling pathway (JAK1/STAT5 phosphorylation). Moreover， the increase in IL-2Rβ protein was dependent upon p38 MAPK activity. These results suggest that oxalate-induced activation of the IL-2Rβ pathway may lead to a plethora of cellular changes， the most common of which is the induction of inflammation. These results suggest a central role for the p38 MAPK pathway in mediating the effects of oxalate in renal cells， and additional studies may provide the key to unlocking novel biochemical targets in stone disease.Keywords:IL-2R; inflammation; kidney stones; oxalate， p38 MAPK.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of RT/CT resistance of LCs are multifactorial and have been understood in part hitherto. miRNAs， key regulators of mRNAs， are well-recognised oncomirs; however， their role in regulating RT response remains poorly understood.Methods:Six human NSCLC and five SCLC cell lines with different SF2 values were investigated. Using microarray we examined whether expression of miRNAs is linked to the RT resistance of NSCLCs or SCLCs. Obtained data were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Apoptosis and senescence were analysed using siRNA transfection， western blot and flow cytometry.Results:miRNA-21， miRNA-1827， miRNA-214， miRNA-339-5p， miRNA-625， miRNA-768-3p， miRNA-523-3p， miRNA-1227， miRNA-324-5p， miRNA-423-3p， miRNA-1301 and miRNA-1249 are differentially expressed in LC cells. miRNA-214 is upregulated in RT-resistant NSCLC cells relative to radiosensitive counterparts. Considering miRNA-214 as a putative regulator of RT resistance， we demonstrate that knockdown of miRNA-214 in radioresistant NSCLCs sensitised them to RT by stimulation of senescence. Consistently， overexpression of miRNA-214 in radiosensitive NSCLCs protected against RT-induced apoptosis. Protection was mediated by p38MAPK， as downregulation of this kinase could reverse the miRNA-214 overexpression-induced resistance of NSCLC cells.Conclusion:miRNA profiling of LC revealed putative RT resistance signalling circuits， which might help in sensitisation of LC to RT.
JNK inhibition blocks piperlongumine-induced cell death and transcriptional activation of heme oxygenase-1 in pancreatic cancer cells.,Apoptosis, 2019 Oct,31243599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31243599/,Piperlongumine (PL) is an alkaloid that inhibits glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) activity， resulting in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cancer-selective cell death. We aimed to identify stress-associated molecular responses to PL treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. GSTP1 directly interacts with JNK， which is activated by oxidative stress and can lead to decreased cancer cell proliferation and cell death. Therefore， we hypothesized that JNK pathways are activated in response to PL treatment. Our results show PL causes dissociation of GSTP1 from JNK; robust JNK， c-Jun， and early ERK activation followed by suppression; increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP; and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and c-Myc in PDAC cells. Gene expression analysis revealed PL caused a > 20-fold induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)， which we hypothesized was a survival mechanism for PDAC cells under enhanced oxidative stress. HO-1 knockout resulted in enhanced PL-induced PDAC cell death under hypoxic conditions. Similarly， high concentrations of the HO-1 inhibitor， ZnPP (10 µM)， sensitized PDAC cells to PL; however， lower concentrations ZnPP (10 nM) and high or low concentrations of SnPP both protected PDAC cells from PL-induced cell death. Interestingly， the JNK inhibitor significantly blocked PL-induced PDAC cell death， Nrf-2 nuclear translocation， and HMOX-1 mRNA expression. Collectively， the results demonstrate JNK signaling contributes to PL-induced PDAC cell death， and at the same time， activates Nrf-2 transcription of HMOX-1 as a compensatory survival mechanism. These results suggest that elevating oxidative stress (using PL) while at the same time impairing antioxidant capacity (inhibiting HO-1) may be an effective therapeutic approach for PDAC.Keywords:Apoptosis; GSTP1 inhibitor; Nrf2; Oxidative stress; SnPP; ZnPP.
A microRNA signature of response to erlotinib is descriptive of TGFβ behaviour in NSCLC.,Sci Rep, 2017 Jun 23,28646226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28646226/,Our previous work identified a 13-gene miRNA signature predictive of response to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor， erlotinib， in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cell lines. Bioinformatic analysis of the signature showed a functional convergence on TGFβ canonical signalling. We hypothesized that TGFβ signalling controls expression of the miRNA genes comprising an erlotinib response signature in NSCLC. Western analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling via Smad2/3/4 occurred differently between erlotinib-resistant A549 and erlotinib- sensitive PC9 cells. We showed that TGFβ induced an interaction between Smad4 and putative Smad Binding Elements in PC9. However， qRT-PCR analysis showed that endogenous miR-140/141/200c expression changes resulted from time in treatments， not the treatments themselves. Moreover， flow cytometry indicated that cells exited the cell cycle in the same manner. Taken together these data indicated that the miRNA comprising the signature are likely regulated by the cell cycle rather than by TGFβ. Importantly， this work revealed that TGFβ did not induce EMT in PC9 cells， but rather TGFβ-inhibition induced an EMT-intermediate. These data also show that growth/proliferation signals by constitutively-activated EGFR may rely on TGFβ and a possible relationship between TGFβ and EGFR signalling may prevent EMT progression in this context rather than promote it.
Identifying inhibitors of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by connectivity map-based systems approach.,J Thorac Oncol, 2011 Nov,21964532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21964532/,Background:Acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype by epithelial cells by means of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered as an early event in the multistep process of tumor metastasis. Therefore， inhibition of EMT might be a rational strategy to prevent metastasis.Methods:Using the global gene expression profile from a cell culture model of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced EMT， we identified potential EMT inhibitors. We used a publicly available database (www.broad.mit.edu/cmap) comprising gene expression profiles obtained from multiple different cell lines in response to various drugs to derive negative correlations to EMT gene expression profile using Connectivity Map， a pattern matching tool.Results:Experimental validation of the identified compounds showed rapamycin as a novel inhibitor of TGF-β signaling along with 17-AAG， a known modulator of TGF-β pathway. Both of these compounds completely blocked EMT and the associated migratory and invasive phenotype. The other identified compound， LY294002， demonstrated a selective inhibition of mesenchymal markers， cell migration and invasion， without affecting the loss of E-cadherin expression or Smad phosphorylation.Conclusions:Our data reveal that rapamycin is a novel modulator of TGF-β signaling， and along with 17-AAG and LY294002， could be used as therapeutic agent for inhibiting EMT. This study demonstrates the potential of a systems approach in identifying novel modulators of a complex biological process.
Cellular cIAP2 gene expression associated with anti-HBV activity of TNF-alpha in hepatoblastoma cells.,J Interferon Cytokine Res, 2005 Oct,16241860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16241860/,Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can abolish HBV gene expression and replication through a noncytopathic mechanism mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). However， the molecular mechanisms of TNF-alpha antiviral activity are not completely understood. To examine TNF-alpha-induced cellular responses and identify genes involved in anti-HBV activity， cDNA microarrays dotted with 14， 112 human genes were used to examine the transcriptional changes in HepG2 after treatment with TNF-alpha for 6 h. The results showed that many genes related to ligands and receptors， signal transduction including the TNF-alpha signaling pathway， mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins， and transcription regulation were induced by TNF-alpha. Interestingly， the TNF-alpha-inducible gene cIAP2 was found to inhibit HBV protein synthesis， viral replication， and transcription. Taken together， our results revealed the global effects of TNF-alpha treatment on hepatocellular gene expression. The antiviral genes identified by microarray could be developed as potential new anti-HBV drugs or for other novel therapies.
Heat shock protein 27 was up-regulated in cisplatin resistant human ovarian tumor cell line and associated with the cisplatin resistance.,Cancer Lett, 2001 Jul 26,11403922,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11403922/,To understand the molecular basis for failure of cisplatin (CDDP) based chemotherapy， we compared gene expressions between CDDP sensitive and resistant ovarian tumor cell line， 2008 and 2008/C13*5.25， by mRNA differential display. We detected both up-regulated and down-regulated bands in the resistant cell and found some of them to be positive on Northern blotting. DNA sequencing revealed one to be mitochondrial heat shock protein 75. We found that HSP27 and HSP70 were also up-regulated in the resistant cell by Western blotting. Further， transient transfection with the HSP27 sense gene made the sensitive cell more resistant， while transient transfection with the antisense gene made it more sensitive.
Characterization of Pt-， Pd-spermine complexes for their effect on polyamine pathway and cisplatin resistance in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells.,Oncol Rep, 2010 Jul,20514439,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20514439/,We have previously showed that platinum drugs up-regulate SSAT and SMO and down-regulate ODC and SAMDC in the polyamine pathway. Several studies including our own established that platinum drugs combined with polyamine analog DENSPM produces synergistic increase in SSAT activity with polyamine depletion. Since polyamine pathway is an important therapeutic target， we investigated whether agents containing both platinum and polyamines have similar effects on the polyamine pathway. Two complexes i) Pt-spermine with two cisplatin molecules linked to a spermine in the center and ii) Pd-spermine with similar structure i， but Pd (II) substituted for Pt (II) were analyzed with respect to their effect on the expression of genes in polyamine pathway， SSAT and SMO protein expression， SSAT activity and polyamine pools. Pt-， Pd-spermine complexes induced significant down-regulation of SMO， arginase 2 and NRF-2， with no change in SSAT， while cisplatin as a single agent or in combination with DENSPM induced significant up-regulation of SSAT and SMO. The SSAT activity was not induced by either Pt- or Pd-spermine in A2780 cells; SMO protein levels were significantly elevated compared to the no-drug control and to a similar extent as cisplatin/DENSPM. The Pd-spm treatment induced a fall in putrescine levels to 33%， spermidine to 62% and spermine to 72% while Pt-spm did not induce such a decline. Comparative cytotoxicity studies in A2780 cells indicated the potency to be cisplatin> Pd-Spm>Pt-Spm. Although both complexes exhibit a lower potency， the degree of resistance itself is much lower for Pt-spermine and Pd-spermine in that order (2.5 and 7.5， respectively) compared to cisplatin ( approximately 12) as tested in cisplatin resistant A2780/CP cells. These studies suggest that Pd (II)-polyamine complexes may constitute a promising group of inorganic compounds for further studies in the development of novel chemotherapy/adjuvant chemotherapy strategies.
PPM1D is a potential therapeutic target in ovarian clear cell carcinomas.,Clin Cancer Res, 2009 Apr 1,19293255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19293255/,Purpose:To identify therapeutic targets in ovarian clear cell carcinomas， a chemoresistant and aggressive type of ovarian cancer.Experimental design:Twelve ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell lines were subjected to tiling path microarray comparative genomic hybridization and genome-wide expression profiling analysis. Regions of high-level amplification were defined and genes whose expression levels were determined by copy number and correlated with gene amplification were identified. The effects of inhibition of PPM1D were assessed using short hairpin RNA constructs and a small-molecule inhibitor (CCT007093). The prevalence of PPM1D amplification and mRNA expression was determined using chromogenic in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR in a cohort of pure ovarian clear cell carcinomas and on an independent series of unselected epithelial ovarian cancers.Results:Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed regions of high-level amplification on 1q32， 1q42， 2q11， 3q24-q26， 5p15， 7p21-p22， 11q13.2-q13.4， 11q22， 17q21-q22， 17q23.2， 19q12-q13， and 20q13.2. Thirty-four genes mapping to these regions displayed expression levels that correlated with copy number gains/amplification. PPM1D had significantly higher levels of mRNA expression in ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell lines harboring gains/amplifications of 17q23.2. PPM1D inhibition revealed that PPM1D expression and phosphatase activity are selectively required for the survival of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell lines with 17q23.2 amplification. PPM1D amplification was significantly associated with ovarian clear cell carcinoma histology (P = 0.0003) and found in 10% of primary ovarian clear cell carcinomas. PPM1D expression levels were significantly correlated with PPM1D gene amplification in primary ovarian clear cell carcinomas.Conclusion:Our data provide strong circumstantial evidence that PPM1D is a potential therapeutic target for a subgroup of ovarian clear cell carcinomas.
Arsenic suppresses gene expression in promyelocytic leukemia cells partly through Sp1 oxidation.,Blood, 2005 Jul 1,15761015,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15761015/,The mechanism by which arsenic dramatically affects gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we report that prolonged exposure of acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells to low levels of arsenic trioxide increased the expression of a set of genes responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We hypothesize that arsenic-induced ROS in turn contribute partially to altered gene expression. To identify genes responsive to arsenic-induced ROS， we used microarray gene expression analysis and identified genes that responded to arsenic and hydrogen peroxide but whose response to arsenic was reversed by an ROS scavenger， N-acetyl-L-cysteine. We found that 26% of the genes significantly responsive to arsenic might have been directly altered by ROS. We further explored the mechanisms by which ROS affects gene regulation and found that the Sp1 transcription factor was oxidized by arsenic treatment， with a corresponding decrease in its in situ binding on the promoters of 3 genes， hTERT， C17， and c-Myc， whose expressions were significantly suppressed. We conclude that ROS contributed partly to arsenic-mediated gene regulation and that Sp1 oxidation contributed to gene suppression by arsenic-induced ROS.
Genistein， a soy isoflavone， induces glutathione peroxidase in the human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3.,Int J Cancer, 2002 Jun 20,12115487,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115487/,Genistein is a major component of soybean isoflavone and has multiple functions resulting in antitumor effects. Prostate cancer is 1 of the targets for the preventive role of genistein. We examined the effect of genistein on human prostate cancer (LNCaP and PC-3) cells. Proliferation of both cell lines was inhibited by genistein treatment in a dose-dependent manner. To obtain the gene expression profile of genistein in LNCaP cells， we performed cDNA microarray analysis. The expression of many genes， including apoptosis inhibitor (survivin)， DNA topoisomerase II， cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK 6)， was downregulated. Expression levels were increased more than 2-fold in only 4 genes. The glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1 gene expression level was the most upregulated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed significant elevation of transcript levels of GPx-1 in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Upregulation of gene expression levels accompanied elevation of GPx enzyme activities. In contrast， no significant changes were observed in the gene expression levels and enzyme activities of the other antioxidant enzymes， superoxide dismutase and catalase. GPx activation might be one of the important characteristics of the effects of genistein on prostate cancer cells.
FOXC2 regulates the G2/M transition of stem cell-rich breast cancer cells and sensitizes them to PLK1 inhibition.,Sci Rep, 2016 Apr 11,27064522,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27064522/,Cancer cells with stem cell properties (CSCs) underpin the chemotherapy resistance and high therapeutic failure of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Even though CSCs are known to proliferate more slowly， they are sensitive to inhibitors of G2/M kinases such as polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Understanding the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms of CSCs will help target these cells more efficiently. Herein， we identify a novel role for the transcription factor FOXC2， which is mostly expressed in CSCs， in the regulation of cell cycle of CSC-enriched breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that FOXC2 expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner， with FOXC2 protein levels accumulating in G2， and rapidly decreasing during mitosis. Knockdown of FOXC2 in CSC-enriched TNBC cells delays mitotic entry without significantly affecting the overall proliferation rate of these cells. Moreover， PLK1 activity is important for FOXC2 protein stability， since PLK1 inhibition reduces FOXC2 protein levels. Indeed， FOXC2 expressing CSC-enriched TNBC cells are sensitive to PLK1 inhibition. Collectively， our findings demonstrate a novel role for FOXC2 as a regulator of the G2/M transition and elucidate the reason for the observed sensitivity of CSC-enriched breast cancer cells to PLK1 inhibitor.
Isolation and characterization of gemcitabine-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells.,Int J Oncol, 2011 Feb,21152861,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21152861/,Gemcitabine is an effective chemotherapy against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However， resistance to gemcitabine reduces its efficacy. We have isolated gemcitabine-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells， termed A549/GR cells. A549/GR cells were resistant to gemcitabine as well as paclitaxel and docetaxel but not carboplatin and irinotecan. The expression level of multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7) in A549/GR cells was higher than that in A549 cells， and the inhibitor of MRP7 by cepharanthine increased the sensitivity to gemcitabine in A549/GR cells. These findings indicate that cepharanthine reversed gemcitabine resistance. To determine predictive molecular markers of gemcitabine resistance for more effective treatment of these tumors， we performed PCR array. We identified that CDKN1A/p21， CYP3A5， microsomal epoxide hyrolase 1 (EPHX1) and ABCC6 (MRP6) were up-regulated >5-fold in A549/GR cells. Gemcitabine also induced the expression of p21 and CYP3A5 in A549 cells. A better understanding of the characterization and mechanism of the resistance to gemcitabine in A549/GR cells may help identify agents that reverse clinical gemcitabine resistance in NSCLC.
Characterization of arsenic trioxide resistant clones derived from Jurkat leukemia T cell line: focus on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.,Chem Biol Interact, 2013 Oct 5,23911876,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911876/,In this study the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in arsenic trioxide (ATO)-treated parental Jurkat cells and also in derived ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of given ATO concentration was investigated. ATO-resistant clones (cultured for 8-12weeks in the presence of 1， 2.5 and 5μM ATO) were characterized by high viability in the presence of ATO but slower growth rate compared to the parental cells. Morphological and functional characterization of derived ATO-resistant clones revealed that they did not differ fundamentally from parental Jurkat cells in terms of cell size， level of GSH， the lysosomal fluorescence or CD95/Fas surface antigen expression. However， a slight increase in the mitochondrial potential (JC-1 staining) was detected in the clones compared to parental Jurkat cells. Side population analysis (Vybrant DyeCycle Violet™ staining) in ATO resistant clones did not indicate any enrichment withcancer stem cells. Akt1/2， AktV or wortmannin inhibitors decreased viability of ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of ATO， with no effect on ATO-treated parental cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that ATO decreased the level of p-Akt in ATO-treated parental cells， while the resistant clones exhibited higher levels of p-Akt immunostaining than parental Jurkat cells. Expression analysis of 84 genes involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway revealed that this pathway was predominantly active in ATO-resistant clones. c-JUN seems to play a key role in the induction of cell death in ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells， as dose-dependent strong up-regulation of JUN was specific for the ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells. On the other hand， changes in expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1)， insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase C isoforms (PRKCZ，PRKCB and PRKCA) may be responsible for the induction of resistance to ATO. The changes in expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) observed in ATO-resistant clones suggest a possibility of induction of different mechanisms in development of resistance to ATO depending on the drug concentration and thus involvement of different signaling mediators.Keywords:Akt kinase; Arsenic resistant clones; Arsenic trioxide; Jurkat; Leukemia.

5-Fluorouracil: identification of novel downstream mediators of tumour response.,Anticancer Res, 2004 Mar-Apr,15152939,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15152939/,Background:5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is routinely used in the treatment of gastrointestinal， breast and head and neck cancers. A major limitation to the use of this drug is acquired or inherent resistance.Materials and methods:To examine the downstream molecular signals activated in response to 5-FU， we used DNA microarray technology to examine global transcriptional changes in 5-FU-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells.Results:We identified several novel 5-FU-inducible target genes that have not previously been linked to 5-FU response， including spermine/spermidine acetyl transferase (SSAT) and annexin II. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with the antifolate tomudex (TDX) and the DNA damaging agent oxaliplatin also caused up-regulation of each target gene. Inactivation of wild-type p53 abrogated the 5-FU-mediated induction of SSAT and annexin II. Inducible expression of thymidylate synthase completely abrogated TDX-， but not 5-FU-mediated induction of each gene. Furthermore， basal expression of SSAT and annexin II was elevated in cells resistant to 5-FU.Conclusion:These data demonstrate the potential of microarray analysis to identify novel genes associated with response or resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.

Leveraging a disulfidptosis-based signature to characterize heterogeneity and optimize treatment in multiple myeloma.,Front Immunol, 2025 Apr 16,40308607,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40308607/,Background:Disulfidptosis is an emerging type of programmed cell death related to ROS accumulation and aberrant disulfide bond formation. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy characterized by a high synthesis rate of disulfide bond-rich proteins and chronic oxidative stress. However， the relationship between disulfidptosis and MM is still unclear.Methods:Using the non-negative matrix factorization and lasso algorithm， we constructed the disulfidptosis-associated subtypes and the prognostic model on the GEO dataset. We further explored genetic mutation mapping， protein-protein interactions， functional enrichment， drug sensitivity， drug prediction， and immune infiltration analysis among subtypes and risk subgroups. To improve the clinical benefits， we combined risk scores and clinical metrics to build a nomogram. Finally，in vitroexperiments examined the expression patterns of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in MM.Results:By cluster analysis， we obtained three subtypes with C2 having a worse prognosis than C3. Consistently， C2 exhibited significantly lower sensitivity to doxorubicin and lenalidomide， as well as a higher propensity for T-cell depletion and a non-responsive state to immunotherapy. Similarly， in the subsequent prognostic model， the high-scoring group had a worse prognosis and a higher probability of T-cell dysfunction， immunotherapy resistance， and cancer cell self-renewal. DRGs and risk genes were widely mutated in cancers. Subtypes and risk subgroups differed in ROS metabolism and the p53 signaling pathway. We further identified eight genes differentially expressed in risk subgroups as drug targets against MM. Then 27 drugs targeting the high-risk group were predicted. Based on the DRGs and risk genes， we constructed the miRNA and TF regulatory networks. The nomogram of combined ISS， age， and risk score showed good predictive performance. qRT-PCR of cell lines and clinical specimens provided further support for prognostic modeling.Conclusion:Our research reveals the prognostic value of disulfidptosis in MM and provides new perspectives for identifying heterogeneity and therapeutic targets.Keywords:disulfidptosis; immunotherapy; multiple myeloma; oxidative stress; prognostic gene signature; targeted drugs; tumor microenvironment.
Deep sequencing reveals transcriptome re-programming of Taxus media cells to the elicitation with methyl jasmonate.,PLoS One, 2013 Apr 30,23646152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23646152/,Background:Plant cell culture represents an alternative source for producing high-value secondary metabolites including paclitaxel (Taxol®)， which is mainly produced in Taxus and has been widely used in cancer chemotherapy. The phytohormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can significantly increase the production of paclitaxel， which is induced in plants as a secondary metabolite possibly in defense against herbivores and pathogens. In cell culture， MeJA also elicits the accumulation of paclitaxel; however， the mechanism is still largely unknown.Methodology/principal findings:To obtain insight into the global regulation mechanism of MeJA in the steady state of paclitaxel production (7 days after MeJA addition)， especially on paclitaxel biosynthesis， we sequenced the transcriptomes of MeJA-treated and untreated Taxus × media cells and obtained ∼ 32.5 M high quality reads， from which 40，348 unique sequences were obtained by de novo assembly. Expression level analysis indicated that a large number of genes were associated with transcriptional regulation， DNA and histone modification， and MeJA signaling network. All the 29 known genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone and paclitaxel were found with 18 genes showing increased transcript abundance following elicitation of MeJA. The significantly up-regulated changes of 9 genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis were validated by qRT-PCR assays. According to the expression changes and the previously proposed enzyme functions， multiple candidates for the unknown steps in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified. We also found some genes putatively involved in the transport and degradation of paclitaxel. Potential target prediction of miRNAs indicated that miRNAs may play an important role in the gene expression regulation following the elicitation of MeJA.Conclusions/significance:Our results shed new light on the global regulation mechanism by which MeJA regulates the physiology of Taxus cells and is helpful to understand how MeJA elicits other plant species besides Taxus.
Rabbit ATG but not horse ATG promotes expansion of functional CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ regulatory T cells in vitro.,Blood, 2008 Apr 1,18250226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18250226/,Regulatory T cells (Treg) play important roles in suppressing immune responses and maintaining tolerance. Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) and horse ATG (hATG) are widely used in the treatment of immune-mediated syndromes， but their effects on Treg are unknown. We show here that in vitro culture of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a low-dose rATG resulted in marked expansion of functional Treg by converting CD4+CD25- T cells to CD4+CD25+ T cells. hATG did not expand but rather decreased Treg. Immuno-blot showed increased expression of FOXP3 and NFAT1 in CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25+ T cells exposed to rATG. PBMCs treated with rATG displayed increased interleukin-10 in culture supernatants than those treated with hATG. Furthermore， rATG and hATG showed differences in their potential to stimulate CD4+ T cells as examined using different activation markers. Microarray revealed that rATG induced markedly different gene-expression patterns in PBMCs， compared with hATG-treated or untreated PBMCs. Our findings indicate that rATG expanded Treg， probably through transcriptional regulation by enhanced NFAT1 expression， in turn conferring CD4+CD25- T cell FOXP3 expression and regulatory activity. The therapeutic effects of rATG may occur not only because of lymphocyte depletion but also enhanced Treg cell number and function.
Shared genes of polycystic ovary syndrome and sedentary behavior as a novel immune landscape biomarker for endometrial cancer.,Sci Rep, 2024 Aug 17,39154063,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39154063/,Endometrial cancer (EC) is associated with significant risk factors such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and sedentary behavior. In our study， we aim to employ machine learning algorithms to investigate the potential molecular processes that underlie their interaction and explore their respective roles in the diagnosis and immunotherapy of EC. The GEO database provides access to microarray data， which was utilized in this study to identify gene expression modules associated with PCOS and sedentary behavior， using weighted gene expression network analysis (WGCNA). Cluego software was then employed to investigate the energy enrichment of shared pathways in both PCOS and sedentary individuals， and differential gene analysis was used to confirm another two databases. The miRNAs-mRNAs controlled network was constructed to verify the pathway. The immune-related factors of the shared pathway in EC were then analyzed. Finally， to validate our findings， we conducted cell experiments using EC cell lines (AN3CA， KLE， Ishikawa， RL95-2， and HEC-1A). We found that increased intracellular aromatic compound anabolism is a common feature of both PCOS and sedentary individuals. We then developed a disease pathway model that was based on the common genetic characteristics of PCOS and sedentary behavior. We utilized pathway typing in EC samples and found a significant survival difference between the two subgroups， with the upregulated expression type exhibiting an immune-hot phenotype. Finally， the experimental results confirmed the expression of the hub gene (NAA15) in EC. The findings of our study suggest that genes related to the intracellular aromatic compound metabolic pathway can be used for immunotherapy of EC.Keywords:Aromatase; Endometrial cancer; MiRNAs–mRNAs; Polycystic ovary syndrome; Sedentary.

Gene expression response to cisplatin treatment in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.,Oncogene, 2007 May 3,17072341,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17072341/,The molecular pathways activated in response to acute cisplatin exposure， as well as the mechanisms involved in the long-term development of cisplatin-resistant cancer cells remain unclear. Using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays， we have examined the kinetics of gene expression changes in a cisplatin-sensitive cell line， A2780， and its cisplatin-resistant derivative， ACRP. Both sensitive and resistant cell lines exhibited a very similar response of p53-inducible genes as early as 16 h after treatment. This p53 response was further increased at the 24-h time point. These experiments identify p53 as the main pathway producing a large-scale transcriptional response after cisplatin treatment in these cells containing wild-type p53. Consistent with a role for the p53 response in cisplatin sensitivity， knockdown of the p53 protein with small interfering RNA led to a twofold decrease in cell survival in the resistant cells. In addition， our analysis also allowed the identification of several genes that are differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cells. These genes include GJA1 (encoding connexin 43 (Cx43)) and TWIST1， which are highly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. The importance of Cx43 in drug resistance was demonstrated through functional analyses， although paradoxically， inhibition of Cx43 function in high expressing cells led to an increase in drug resistance. The pathways important in cisplatin response， as well as the genes found differentially expressed between cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cells， may represent targets for therapy aimed at reversing drug resistance.
Innate immune parameters and haemolymph protein expression profile to evaluate the immunotoxicity of tributyltin on abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta).,Dev Comp Immunol, 2010 Oct,20488199,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20488199/,The immunotoxicity of tributyltin (TBT) on marine gastropods has been comparatively little studied although risks to wildlife associated with this compound are well known. In this study， a 30-day trial was conducted to evaluate the immunotoxic effects on abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta) by exposing a range of doses of TBT (0， 2， 10， and 50 ng/L). Innate immune parameters， including phagocytic ability (PA)， lysozyme activity， phenoloxidase (PO) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were monitored at intervals of 5， 15 and 30 days. Haemolymph protein expression profile was also examined at the end of the experiment. The results showed that PA value， lysozyme activity and PO level significantly decreased compared with the controls (P < 0.05)， which indicated that TBT exposure markedly suppressed non-specific immune competence. Exposure to TBT also caused variation in protein expression patterns of haemolymph. Among the protein spots of differential expressions， seven proteins from the haemolymph of TBT-treated abalone were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Three protein spots increased and were identified as carrier-like peptide， peroxidase 21 precursor and creatine phosphokinase. These proteins are believed to up-regulate in expression as a response to detoxification and antioxidative stress mechanisms. The other four protein spots that down-regulated in TBT-treated groups were identified as aromatase-like protein， protein kinase C， ceruloplasmin and microtubule-actin crosslinking factor 1， and these proteins play an important role in endocrine regulation and immune defense. Taken together， the results demonstrate that TBT impair abalone immunological ability and is a potential immune disruptor.
In vitro evaluation of ferutinin on proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation in human unrestricted Somatic stem cells.,Steroids, 2021 Aug,34010709,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34010709/,Osteoporosis is a common disease in post-menopausal women. The increased risk of breast cancer and malignancy with hormone replacement， hampers its wide-usage. Phytoestrogens are known to have selective estrogen receptor modulator activity. The present study aims to determine how ferutinin affects unrestricted human Somatic Stem Cells (USSCs) osteogenic differentiation. The effect of ferutinin on USSCs proliferation was assessed by MTT assay while osteogenesis was evaluated using Alkaline Phosphatase Activity (ALP)， calcium deposition and Alizarin Red Staining. Quantitative real-time PCR was applied to examine the expression of bone specific genes such as osteocalcin， Runx2， and BMP-2. Ferutinin (5-15 µg/mL) could positively impact on the proliferation of cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also， ALP enzyme activity and calcium deposition were enhanced in the presence of ferutinin. Based on real-time PCR results， ferutinin could increase the expression of bone marker genes. The pattern of ferutinin effect on gene expression is similar to standard synthetic estrogen， 17-β-estradiol. In the presence of the estrogen activity inhibitor (ICI)， the effect of ferutinin on ALP and gene level was diminished. In conclusion， ferutinin may be considered as a potential candidate for the stem cell therapy in osteoporosis.Keywords:Ferula species; Ferutinin; Human unrestricted Somatic stem cells; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis.
Silencing expression of ribosomal protein L26 and L29 by RNA interfering inhibits proliferation of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells.,Mol Cell Biochem, 2012 Nov,22868929,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22868929/,Oncogenic KRAS， an important target for antitumor therapy， contributes to pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis， progression and maintenance. However， intracellular compensation regulation can help cells to resist the targeted therapy. Gene knockdown method such as RNAi may help to understand this intracellular regulatory system and discover novel therapeutic approach. In this study， two stable transfected cell lines were constructed through lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting KRAS of PANC-1 cells， to investigate cell response to the knockdown of KRAS. Human whole genome microarray was then used to compare the gene expression profile. As a result， ribosomal proteins L26 and L29 (RPL26 and RPL29) were dramatically upregulated by KRAS-shRNA specifically. To identify whether RPL26 or RPL29 was critical for PANC-1 cells， siRNAs against RPL26 and RPL29 were designed and transfected in vitro. The results showed that knockdown of RPL26 or RPL29 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation， induced cell arrest at G0/G1 phase and enhanced cell apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay indicated that silencing of RPL26 or RPL29 markedly decreased the intracellular ROS generation. Our findings imply that siRNA interference against RPL26 and RPL29 is of potential value for intervention of pancreatic cancer.
Activation of p38/JNK pathway is responsible for embelin induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells: transitional role of reactive oxygen species.,PLoS One, 2014 Jan 22,24466324,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24466324/,The natural product embelin has been demonstrated to possess a wide range of therapeutic properties， however， the mechanisms by which it exerts anticancer effects are not yet clear. By monitoring the molecular changes associated during early apoptotic phase， we have identified the crucial role of oxidative stress induced MAP kinase signalling as a predominant mechanism for its anticancer effects. Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with embelin resulted in the enhancement of phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK levels as early as 4h. Pretreatment of cells with specific inhibitors of p38 (PD169316) and JNK (SP600125) abrogated embelin-induced caspase-3 activation. Studies employing embelin in the presence or absence of specific MAP kinase inhibitors indicated that the observed changes in phosphorylation levels of p38， JNK and ERK 1/2 are solely due to embelin and not because of cross-talk between MAP kinases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in embelin induced alterations in MAP kinase phosphorylation and apoptosis as pretreatment of cells with FeTMPyP mitigated this effect. The observed changes are not due to the inhibitory effect of embelin on XIAP as cells treated with SMAC-N7-Ant peptide， a specific inhibitor of XIAP's BIR3 domain did not mimic embelin induced apoptotic effects. The findings of the present study clearly indicate the crucial role of p38 and JNK pathways in embelin induced apoptosis and provide us with new clues for improving its therapeutic efficacy.
Molecular characterizations of derivatives of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil.,Int J Oncol, 2004 May,15067352,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15067352/,5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer， but resistance to 5-FU remains a major obstacle to successful therapy. We generated 5-FU-resistant derivatives of the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line by serial passage of these cells in the presence of increasing 5-FU concentrations in an attempt to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in resistance to 5-FU. Two resultant resistant derivatives， HCT116 ResB and ResD， were characterized for resistance phenotypes， genotypes， and gene expression using cells maintained long-term in 5-FU-free media. Compared to parental HCT116 cells that respond to 5-FU challenge by inducing high levels of apoptosis， ResB and ResD derivatives had significantly reduced apoptotic fractions when transiently challenged with 5-FU. ResB and ResD cells were respectively 27- and 121-fold more resistant to 5-FU， had increased doubling times， and significantly increased plating efficiencies compared to the parental cells. Both resistant derivatives retained the wild-type TP53 genotype， TP53 copy number and CGH profile characteristic of the parental line. Alterations in gene expression in the resistant derivatives compared to the parental line were assessed using oligonucleotide microarrays. Overall， the 5-FU-resistant derivatives were characterized by reduced apoptosis and a more aggressive growth phenotype， consistent with the observed up-regulation of apoptosis-inhibitory genes (e.g.， IRAK1， MALT1， BIRC5)， positive growth-regulatory genes (e.g.， CCND3， CCNE2， CCNF， CYR61)， and metastasis genes (e.g.， LMNB1， F3， TMSNB)， and down-regulation of apoptosis-promoting genes (e.g.， BNIP3， BNIP3L， FOXO3A) and negative growth-regulatory genes (e.g.， AREG， CCNG2， CDKN1A， CDKN1C， GADD45A). 5-FU metabolism-associated genes (e.g.， TYMS， DTYMK， UP) and DNA repair genes (e.g.， FEN1， FANCG， RAD23B) were also up-regulated in one or both resistant derivatives， suggesting that the resistant derivatives might be able to overcome both 5-FU inhibition of thymidylate synthase and the DNA damage caused by 5-FU， respectively. Development of 5-FU resistance thus appears to encompass deregulation of apoptosis-， proliferation-， DNA repair-， and metastasis-associated regulatory pathways.
Mitigating candidiasis with acarbose by targeting Candida albicans alpha-glucosidase: in-silico， in-vitro and transcriptomic approaches.,Sci Rep, 2024 May 24,38789465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38789465/,Biofilm-associated candidiasis poses a significant challenge in clinical settings due to the limited effectiveness of existing antifungal treatments. The challenges include increased pathogen virulence， multi-drug resistance， and inadequate penetration of antimicrobials into biofilm structures. One potential solution to this problem involves the development of novel drugs that can modulate fungal virulence and biofilm formation， which is essential for pathogenesis. Resistance in Candida albicans is initiated by morphological changes from yeast to hyphal form. This transition triggers a series of events such as cell wall elongation， increased adhesion， invasion of host tissues， pathogenicity， biofilm formation， and the initiation of an immune response. The cell wall is a critical interface for interactions with host cells， primarily through various cell wall proteins， particularly mannoproteins. Thus， cell wall proteins and enzymes are considered potential antifungal targets. In this regard， we explored α-glucosidase as our potential target which plays a crucial role in processing mannoproteins. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of α-glucosidase leads to defects in cell wall integrity， reduced adhesion， diminished secretion of hydrolytic enzymes， alterations in immune recognition， and reduced pathogenicity. Since α-glucosidase， primarily converts carbohydrates， our study focuses on FDA-approved carbohydrate mimic drugs (Glycomimetics) with well-documented applications in various biological contexts. Through virtual screening of 114 FDA-approved carbohydrate-based drugs， a pseudo-sugar Acarbose， emerged as a top hit. Acarbose is known for its pharmacological potential in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus by targeting α-glucosidase. Our preliminary investigations indicate that Acarbose effectively inhibits C. albicans biofilm formation， reduces virulence， impairs morphological switching， and hinders the adhesion and invasion of host cells， all at very low concentrations in the nanomolar range. Furthermore， transcriptomic analysis reveals the mechanism of action of Acarbose， highlighting its role in targeting α-glucosidase.Keywords:Candida albicans; Acarbose; Candidiasis; Drug repurposing; Glycomimetics; Mannoproteins; α-glucosidase.
NAMPT is the cellular target of STF-31-like small-molecule probes.,ACS Chem Biol, 2014 Oct 17,25058389,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25058389/,The small-molecule probes STF-31 and its analogue compound 146 were discovered while searching for compounds that kill VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma cell lines selectively and have been reported to act via direct inhibition of the glucose transporter GLUT1. We profiled the sensitivity of 679 cancer cell lines to STF-31 and found that the pattern of response is tightly correlated with sensitivity to three different inhibitors of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). We also performed whole-exome next-generation sequencing of compound 146-resistant HCT116 clones and identified a recurrent NAMPT-H191R mutation. Ectopic expression of NAMPT-H191R conferred resistance to both STF-31 and compound 146 in cell lines. We further demonstrated that both STF-31 and compound 146 inhibit the enzymatic activity of NAMPT in a biochemical assay in vitro. Together， our cancer-cell profiling and genomic approaches identify NAMPT inhibition as a critical mechanism by which STF-31-like compounds inhibit cancer cells.
LncRNA EPR controls epithelial proliferation by coordinating Cdkn1a transcription and mRNA decay response to TGF-β.,Nat Commun, 2019 Apr 29,31036808,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31036808/,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as regulators of fundamental biological processes. Here we report on the characterization of an intergenic lncRNA expressed in epithelial tissues which we termed EPR (Epithelial cell Program Regulator). EPR is rapidly downregulated by TGF-β and its sustained expression largely reshapes the transcriptome， favors the acquisition of epithelial traits， and reduces cell proliferation in cultured mammary gland cells as well as in an animal model of orthotopic transplantation. EPR generates a small peptide that localizes at epithelial cell junctions but the RNA molecule per se accounts for the vast majority of EPR-induced gene expression changes. Mechanistically， EPR interacts with chromatin and regulates Cdkn1a gene expression by affecting both its transcription and mRNA decay through its association with SMAD3 and the mRNA decay-promoting factor KHSRP， respectively. We propose that EPR enables epithelial cells to control proliferation by modulating waves of gene expression in response to TGF-β.
The antischistosomal potential of GSK-J4， an H3K27 demethylase inhibitor: insights from molecular modeling， transcriptomics and in vitro assays.,Parasit Vectors, 2020 Mar 17,32178714,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32178714/,Background:Schistosomiasis chemotherapy is largely based on praziquantel (PZQ). Although PZQ is very safe and tolerable， it does not prevent reinfection and emerging resistance is a primary concern. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of epigenetic machinery in Schistosoma mansoni may result in severe alterations in parasite development， leading to death. This new route for drug discovery in schistosomiasis has focused on classes of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) as epigenetic drug targets. Schistosoma histone demethylases also seem to be important in the transition of cercariae into schistosomula， as well as sexual differentiation in adult worms.Methods:The Target-Pathogen database and molecular docking assays were used to prioritize the druggability of S. mansoni histone demethylases. The transcription profile of Smp_03400 was re-analyzed using available databases. The effect of GSK-J4 inhibitor in schistosomula and adult worms' motility/viability/oviposition was assessed by in vitro assays. Ultrastructural analysis was performed on adult worms exposed to GSK-J4 by scanning electron microscopy， while internal structures and muscle fiber integrity was investigated by confocal microscopy after Langeron's carmine or phalloidin staining.Results:The present evaluation of the potential druggability of 14 annotated S. mansoni demethylase enzymes identified the S. mansoni ortholog of human KDM6A/UTX (Smp_034000) as the most suitable druggable target. In silico analysis and molecular modeling indicated the potential for cofactor displacement by the chemical probe GSK-J4. Our re-analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that Smp_034000 expression peaks at 24 h in newly transformed schistosomula and 5-week-old adult worms. Moreover， this gene was highly expressed in the testes of mature male worms compared to the rest of the parasite body. In in vitro schistosome cultures， treatment with GSK-J4 produced striking effects on schistosomula mortality and adult worm motility and mortality， as well as egg oviposition， in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Unexpectedly， western blot assays did not demonstrate overall modulation of H3K27me3 levels in response to GSK-J4. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy revealed the loss of original features in muscle fibers and alterations in cell-cell contact following GSK-J4 treatment.Conclusions:GSK-J4 presents promising potential for antischistosomal control; however， the underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation.Keywords:Anthelmintic drug discovery; Epigenetics; Jumonji histone demethylase.
Targeting polo-like kinase 1 by NMS-P937 in osteosarcoma cell lines inhibits tumor cell growth and partially overcomes drug resistance.,Invest New Drugs, 2014 Dec,25193492,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25193492/,Background:Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) has emerged as a prognostic factor in various neoplasms， but only scarce data have been reported for high-grade osteosarcoma (OS). In this study， we assessed PLK1 expression and the efficacy of PLK1 inhibitor NMS-P937 in OS.Methods:PLK1 expression was assessed on 21 OS clinical samples and on a panel of human OS cell lines. In vitro efficacy of NMS-P937 was evaluated on nine drug-sensitive and six drug-resistant human OS cell lines， either as single agent or in combination with the drugs used in chemotherapy for OS.Results:PLK1 expression was higher in OS clinical samples and cell lines compared to normal human tissue. A higher PLK1 expression at diagnosis appeared to be associated with an unfavourable clinical outcome. PLK1 silencing produced growth inhibition， cell cycle retardation and apoptosis induction in human OS cell lines. NMS-P937 proved to be highly active in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines， with the only exception of ABCB1-overexpressing， Doxorubicin (DX)-resistant variants. However， in these cells， the association of NMS-P937 with DX was able to revert DX-resistance by negatively interfering with ABCB1 transport activity. NMS-P937 was also able to decrease clonogenic and migration ability of human OS cell lines.Conclusion:PLK1 can be proposed as a new candidate target for OS. Targeting PLK1 in OS with NMS-P937 in association with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs may be a new interesting therapeutic option， since this approach has proved to be active against drug resistant cells.
Pleiotropic resistance to DNA-interactive drugs is associated with increased expression of genes involved in DNA replication， repair， and stress response.,Cancer Res, 2000 Sep 15,11016623,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11016623/, combination of four genetic suppressor elements (GSEs)， two of which are derived from putative transcriptional regulators， was previously found to increase resistance to drugs inhibiting DNA replication in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. In the present study， two GSE-transduced cell lines， isolated with and without cytotoxic selection， were found to be resistant to a diverse group of DNA-interactive agents， including aphidicolin， hydroxyurea， cytarabine， etoposide， doxorubicin， and mafosfamide. Changes in gene expression associated with GSE-induced drug resistance were analyzed by cDNA array hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. Twenty genes were found to be up-regulated in both of the resistant cell lines. These include genes involved in DNA replication and repair (e.g.， PCNA， XRCC1， B-MYB， and GADD45)， transcriptional regulators associated with stress response， and cell cycle checkpoint control (e.g.， YB-1， DBPA， and ATF4)， and genes for signal transduction proteins (e.g.， protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and regulatory subunits alpha and beta of cAMP-dependent protein kinase). The observed changes in gene expression may play a role in pleiotropic resistance to different classes of DNA-targeting drugs.
SAA1 is upregulated in gastric cancer-associated fibroblasts possibly by its enhancer activation.,Carcinogenesis, 2021 Feb 25,33284950,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33284950/,Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) tend to have tumor-promoting capacity， and can provide therapeutic targets. Even without cancer cells， CAF phenotypes are stably maintained， and DNA methylation and H3K27me3 changes have been shown to be involved. Here， we searched for a potential therapeutic target in primary CAFs from gastric cancer and a mechanism for its dysregulation. Expression microarray using eight CAFs and seven non-CAFs (NCAFs) revealed that serum amyloid A1 (SAA1)， which encodes an acute phase secreted protein， was second most upregulated in CAFs， following IGF2. Conditioned medium (CM) derived from SAA1-overexpressing NCAFs was shown to increase migration of gastric cancer cells compared with that from control NCAFs， and its tumor-promoting effect was comparable to that of CM from CAFs. In addition， increased migration of cancer cells by CM from CAFs was mostly canceled with CM from CAFs with SAA1 knockdown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR showed that CAFs had higher levels of H3K27ac， an active enhancer mark， in the promoter and the two far upstream regions of SAA1 than NCAFs. Also， BET bromodomain inhibitors， JQ1 and mivebresib， decreased SAA1 expression and tumor-promoting effects in CAFs， suggesting SAA1 upregulation by enhancer activation in CAFs. Our present data showed that SAA1 is a candidate therapeutic target from gastric CAFs and indicated that increased enhancer acetylation is important for its overexpression.
Pharmacological Inhibition of O-GlcNAcase Does Not Increase Sensitivity of Glucocorticoid Receptor-Mediated Transrepression.,PLoS One, 2015 Dec 15,26670328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26670328/,Glucocorticoid signaling regulates target genes by multiple mechanisms， including the repression of transcriptional activities of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) though direct protein-protein interactions and subsequent O-GlcNAcylation of RNA polymerase II (pol II). Recent studies have shown that overexpression of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT)， which adds an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) group to the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II， increases the transrepression effects of glucocorticoids (GC). As O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from O-GlcNAcylated proteins， we hypothesized that the potentiation of GC effects following OGT overexpression could be similarly observed via the direct inhibition of OGA， inhibiting O-GlcNAc removal from pol II. Here we show that despite pharmacological evidence of target engagement by a selective small molecule inhibitor of OGA， there is no evidence for a sensitizing effect on glucocorticoid-mediated effects on TNF-α promoter activity， or gene expression generally， in human cells. Furthermore， inhibition of OGA did not potentiate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Thus， despite evidence for O-GlcNAc modification of RNA pol II in GR-mediated transrepression， our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of OGA does not potentiate or enhance glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression.
The interferon-inducible 9-27 gene modulates the susceptibility to natural killer cells and the invasiveness of gastric cancer cells.,Cancer Lett, 2005 Apr 28,15808405,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15808405/, an effort to identify immune suppressive molecules in gastric cancer cells， a signal sequence trap was employed. Among the genes identified， 9-27 gene was highly expressed in gastric tumor tissues and in cancer cell lines. It was induced by IFN-gamma treatment， but not by TNF-alpha or TGF-beta1 treatment. The overexpression of 9-27 in the gastric cancer cells rendered tumor cells more resistant to natural killer cells. In addition， the 9-27-overexpressed cells showed an increased migration and an invasive capacity when compared with the control cells. Taken together， these data indicate that 9-27 plays a role in malignant progression by suppressing natural killer cells and by increasing the invasive potential of gastric cancer cells.
Frequent CTLA4-CD28 gene fusion in diverse types of T-cell lymphoma.,Haematologica, 2016 Jun,26819049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26819049/,CTLA4 and CD28 are co-regulatory receptors with opposite roles in T-cell signaling. By RNA sequencing， we identified a fusion between the two genes from partial gene duplication in a case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The fusion gene， which codes for the extracellular domain of CTLA4 and the cytoplasmic region of CD28， is likely capable of transforming inhibitory signals into stimulatory signals for T-cell activation. Ectopic expression of the fusion transcript in Jurkat and H9 cells resulted in enhanced proliferation and AKT and ERK phosphorylation， indicating activation of downstream oncogenic pathways. To estimate the frequency of this gene fusion in mature T-cell lymphomas， we examined 115 T-cell lymphoma samples of diverse subtypes using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis and Sanger sequencing. We identified the fusion in 26 of 45 cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (58%)， nine of 39 peripheral T-cell lymphomas， not otherwise specified (23%)， and nine of 31 extranodal NK/T cell lymphomas (29%). We further investigated the mutation status of 70 lymphoma-associated genes using ultra-deep targeted resequencing for 74 mature T-cell lymphoma samples. The mutational landscape we obtained suggests that T-cell lymphoma results from diverse combinations of multiple gene mutations. The CTLA4-CD28 gene fusion is likely a major contributor to the pathogenesis of T-cell lymphomas and represents a potential target for anti-CTLA4 cancer immunotherapy.
The latency-associated nuclear antigen of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus modulates cellular gene expression and protects lymphoid cells from p16 INK4A-induced cell cycle arrest.,J Biol Chem, 2005 Feb 4,15525642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15525642/,Latently infected Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes-virus (KSHV)-associated tumor cells have both endothelial and lymphoid origins and express a limited set of latent viral genes. One such gene， ORF73， encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)， a multifunctional protein that plays roles in viral DNA replication， episome maintenance， and transcriptional regulation. LANA interacts with cellular proteins involved in transcriptional regulation such as the tumor suppressors， retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53， and RING3 family members. Although several reports about specific LANA-regulated promoters exist， only limited data are available that address how LANA expression in KSHV-infected cells globally affects cellular gene expression， thereby potentially contributing to KSHV pathogenicity. To investigate this question， we generated an Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitts lymphoma line that expresses LANA from a tetracycline-inducible promoter (BJAB/Tet-On/LANA)， and we performed microarray-based gene expression profiling. Expression profiling at different time points post-induction revealed that 186 genes were activated or repressed over 2-fold in the presence of LANA. Of these genes， 41 are regulated in the Rb/E2F pathway， whereas 7 are related to p53 signaling. To determine whether these gene expression changes translate into LANA-dependent changes in cell cycle regulation， we overexpressed p16 INK4a， a CDK4/6 inhibitor that efficiently induces cell cycle arrest in Rb-positive cells. Under these conditions， LANA expression protects lymphoid cells from p16 INK4a-induced cell cycle arrest and induces S-phase entry.
Role of lifeguard β-isoform in the development of breast cancer.,Oncol Rep, 2014 Oct,25069766,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25069766/,In the last century there has been great progress in the treatment of breast cancer by improving drug and radiation therapy as well as surgical techniques. Despite this development， breast cancer remains a major cause of death among women in Europe and the US. The cause of breast cancer at the cellular level is still not fully understood. In the present study， we investigated the expression of the Lifeguard β-isoform in breast cancer tissues. In contrast to Lifeguard， the β‑isoform has one transmembrane domain less， which is the last of seven (99 bp)， and due to this we suspect that the Lifeguard β-isoform exhibits a different function. We determined the expression and function of the β-isoform of Lifeguard in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)， a human breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A) and in breast tumour tissue sections. Western blotting， PCR arrays and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the expression of Lifeguard and its β-isoform. Moreover， we investigated the ability of Lifeguard β-isoform expression to inhibit apoptosis induced by Fas. Our results indicated that Lifeguard β-isoform is strongly expressed in breast tumour tissues. More notably， we demonstrated that Fas sensitivity was reduced in the MCF10A breast cells expressing the Lifeguard β-isoform. Taken together， our findings indicate the role of the Lifeguard β-isoform as an anti‑apoptotic protein and provide further evidence of the potential of the Lifeguard β-isoform as a target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Microarray analysis of nemorosone-induced cytotoxic effects on pancreatic cancer cells reveals activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR).,Br J Pharmacol, 2011 Mar,21091652,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21091652/,Background and purpose:Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading cancer-related causes of death due to high chemo-resistance and fast metastasation. Nemorosone， a polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol， has recently been identified as a promising anticancer agent. Here， we examine its growth-inhibitory effects on pancreatic cancer cells. Based on transcription profiling， a molecular mode of action is proposed.Experimental approach:Nemorosone cytotoxicity was assessed by the resazurin proliferation assay on pancreatic cancer cells and fibroblasts. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining as well as cytochrome c and caspase activation assays. Staining with the voltage-dependent dye JC-1 and fluorescence microscopy were used to detect effects on mitochondrial membrane potential. Total RNA was isolated from treated cell lines and subjected to microarray analysis， subsequent pathway identification and modelling. Gene expression data were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and siRNA-mediated gene knock-down.Key results:Nemorosone significantly inhibited cancer cell growth， induced cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase-dependent apoptosis， rapidly abolished mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated cytosolic calcium levels， while fibroblasts were largely unaffected. Expression profiling revealed 336 genes to be affected by nemorosone. A total of 75 genes were altered in all three cell lines， many of which were within the unfolded protein response (UPR) network. DNA damage inducible transcript 3 was identified as a key regulator in UPR-mediated cell death.Conclusions and implications:Nemorosone could be a lead compound for the development of novel anticancer drugs amplifying the already elevated UPR level in solid tumours， thus driving them into apoptosis. This study forms the basis for further investigations identifying nemorosone's direct molecular target(s).
Inhibition of WNT signaling reduces differentiation and induces sensitivity to doxorubicin in human malignant neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.,Anticancer Drugs, 2017 Jun,28240680,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28240680/,Neuroblastoma is one of the most common cancers in infancy， arising from the neuroblasts during embryonic development. This cancer is difficult to treat and resistance to chemotherapy is often found; therefore， clinical trials of novel therapeutic approaches， such as targeted-cancer signaling， could be an alternative for a better treatment. WNT signaling plays significant roles in the survival， proliferation， and differentiation of human neuroblastoma. In this report， WNT signaling of a malignant human neuroblastoma cell line， SH-SY5Y cells， was inhibited by XAV939， a specific inhibitor of the Tankyrase enzyme. XAV939 treatment led to the reduction of β-catenin within the cells， confirming its inhibitory effect of WNT. The inhibition of WNT signaling by XAV939 did not affect cell morphology， survival， and proliferation; however， the differentiation and sensitivity to anticancer drugs of human neuroblastoma cells were altered. The treatment of XAV939 resulted in the downregulation of mature neuronal markers， including β-tubulin III， PHOX2A， and PHOX2B， whereas neural progenitor markers (PAX6， TFAP2α， and SLUG) were upregulated. In addition， the combination of XAV939 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells to doxorubicin in both 2D and 3D culture systems. Microarray gene expression profiling suggested numbers of candidate target genes of WNT inhibition by XAV939， in particular， p21， p53， ubiquitin C， ZBED8， MDM2， CASP3， and FZD1， and this explained the enhanced sensitivity of SH-SY5Y cells to doxorubicin. Altogether， these results proposed that the altered differentiation of human malignant neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting WNT signaling sensitized the cells to anticancer drugs. This approach could thus serve as an effective treatment option for aggressive brain malignancy.
Oxidative Stress Resistance in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Renewal by Self-Eating.,PLoS One, 2015 Dec 15,26671576,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26671576/,Resistant cancer phenotype is a key obstacle in the successful therapy of prostate cancer. The primary aim of our study was to explore resistance mechanisms in the advanced type of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and to clarify the role of autophagy in these processes. We performed time-lapse experiment (48 hours) with ROS generating plumbagin by using multimodal holographic microscope. Furthermore， we also performed the flow-cytometric analysis and the qRT-PCR gene expression analysis at 12 selected time points. TEM and confocal microscopy were used to verify the results. We found out that autophagy (namely mitophagy) is an important resistance mechanism. The major ROS producing mitochondria were coated by an autophagic membrane derived from endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. According to our results， increasing ROS resistance may be also accompanied by increased average cell size and polyploidization， which seems to be key resistance mechanism when connected with an escape from senescence. Many different types of cell-cell interactions were recorded including entosis， vesicular transfer， eating of dead or dying cells， and engulfment and cannibalism of living cells. Entosis was disclosed as a possible mechanism of polyploidization and enabled the long-term survival of cancer cells. Significantly reduced cell motility was found after the plumbagin treatment. We also found an extensive induction of pluripotency genes expression (NANOG， SOX2， and POU5F1) at the time-point of 20 hours. We suppose， that overexpression of pluripotency genes in the portion of prostate tumour cell population exposed to ROS leads to higher developmental plasticity and capability to faster respond to changes in the extracellular environment that could ultimately lead to an alteration of cell fate.
Genome-wide methylation and expression profiling identifies promoter characteristics affecting demethylation-induced gene up-regulation in melanoma.,BMC Med Genomics, 2010 Feb 9,20144234,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20144234/,Background:Abberant DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides represents a common mechanism of transcriptional silencing in cancer. Since CpG methylation is a reversible event， tumor supressor genes that have undergone silencing through this mechanism represent promising targets for epigenetically active anti-cancer therapy. The cytosine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) induces genomic hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase， and is an example of an epigenetic agent that is thought to act by up-regulating silenced genes.Methods:It is unclear why decitabine causes some silenced loci to re-express， while others remain inactive. By applying data-mining techniques to large-scale datasets， we attempted to elucidate the qualities of promoter regions that define susceptibility to the drug's action. Our experimental data， derived from melanoma cell strains， consist of genome-wide gene expression data before and after treatment with decitabine， as well as genome-wide data on un-treated promoter methylation status， and validation of specific genes by bisulfite sequencing.Results:We show that the combination of promoter CpG content and methylation level informs the ability of decitabine treatment to up-regulate gene expression. Promoters with high methylation levels and intermediate CpG content appear most susceptible to up-regulation by decitabine， whereas few of those highly methylated promoters with high CpG content are up-regulated. For promoters with low methylation levels， those with high CpG content are more likely to be up-regulated， whereas those with low CpG content are underrepresented among up-regulated genes.Conclusions:Clinically， elucidating the patterns of action of decitabine could aid in predicting the likelihood of up-regulating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes and others from pathways involved with tumor biology. As a first step toward an eventual translational application， we build a classifier to predict gene up-regulation based on promoter methylation and CpG content， which achieves a performance of 0.77 AUC.
Correlation of protein and gene expression profiles of inflammatory proteins after endotoxin challenge in human subjects.,DNA Cell Biol, 2005 Jul,16008510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16008510/,dministration of endotoxin (LPS) in humans results in profound physiological responses， including activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the release of inflammatory factors. The time course of the response of selected inflammatory proteins was examined in healthy subjects (n = 6) administered a single intravenous dose of the purified derivative of endotoxin (3.0 ng/kg). Microarray analysis demonstrated changes in the expression of a number of genes， which were confirmed in separate in vitro endotoxin stimulation experiments. Subsequent TaqMan analysis of genes of interest indicated time-dependent changes in the expression of many of these genes. This included pre-B cell enhancing factor， which was identified on microarray analysis as being markedly upregulated following endotoxin stimulation. Protein expression of the genes examined by TaqMan analysis was measured and demonstrated the appearance of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and sTNF-R proteins in the plasma beginning within 1 h after dosing， followed by other cytokines/ inflammatory markers (e.g.， IL-1ra， G-CSF， IL-6， IL-8， and IL-10) and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and SOCS-3). In general， cytokine protein expression correlated well with gene expression; however， the temporal profile of expression of some genes did not correlate well with the protein data. For many of these proteins， the lack of correlation was attributable to alternate tissue sources， which were demonstrated on TaqMan analysis. Principal component analysis indicated that cytokines could be grouped according to their temporal pattern of response， with most transcript levels returning to baseline 24 h following endotoxin administration. The combination of cDNA microarray and TaqMan analysis to identify and quantify changes in gene expression， along with the analysis of protein expression， can be useful in investigating inflammatory and other diseases.
Colorectal cancer cell lines are representative models of the main molecular subtypes of primary cancer.,Cancer Res, 2014 Jun 15,24755471,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24755471/,Human colorectal cancer cell lines are used widely to investigate tumor biology， experimental therapy， and biomarkers. However， to what extent these established cell lines represent and maintain the genetic diversity of primary cancers is uncertain. In this study， we profiled 70 colorectal cancer cell lines for mutations and DNA copy number by whole-exome sequencing and SNP microarray analyses， respectively. Gene expression was defined using RNA-Seq. Cell line data were compared with those published for primary colorectal cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Notably， we found that exome mutation and DNA copy-number spectra in colorectal cancer cell lines closely resembled those seen in primary colorectal tumors. Similarities included the presence of two hypermutation phenotypes， as defined by signatures for defective DNA mismatch repair and DNA polymerase ε proofreading deficiency， along with concordant mutation profiles in the broadly altered WNT， MAPK， PI3K， TGFβ， and p53 pathways. Furthermore， we documented mutations enriched in genes involved in chromatin remodeling (ARID1A， CHD6， and SRCAP) and histone methylation or acetylation (ASH1L， EP300， EP400， MLL2， MLL3， PRDM2， and TRRAP). Chromosomal instability was prevalent in nonhypermutated cases， with similar patterns of chromosomal gains and losses. Although paired cell lines derived from the same tumor exhibited considerable mutation and DNA copy-number differences， in silico simulations suggest that these differences mainly reflected a preexisting heterogeneity in the tumor cells. In conclusion， our results establish that human colorectal cancer lines are representative of the main subtypes of primary tumors at the genomic level， further validating their utility as tools to investigate colorectal cancer biology and drug responses.

RNA-Seq Explores the Mechanism of Oxygen-Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy Based on All-in-One Nanobubbles to Enhance Ferroptosis for the Treatment of HCC.,Int J Nanomedicine, 2022 Jan 7,35027829,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35027829/,"Background:The combination of sonodynamic therapy and oxygenation strategy is widely used in cancer treatment. However， due to the complexity， heterogeneity and irreversible hypoxic environment produced by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues， oxygen-enhancing sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has failed to achieve the desired results. With the emergence of ferroptosis with reactive oxygen species (ROS) cytotoxicity， this novel cell death method has attracted widespread attention.Methods:In this study， nanobubbles (NBs) were connected with the sonosensitizer Indocyanine green (ICG) to construct a 2-in-1 nanoplatform loaded with RAS-selective lethal (RSL3， ferroptosis promoter) (RSL3@O2-ICG NBs)， combined with oxygen-enhanced SDT and potent ferroptosis. In addition， nanobubbles (NBs) combined with low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS) are called ultrasound-targeted nanobubble destruction (UTND) to ensure specific drug release and improve safety.Results:MDA/GSH and other related experimental results show that RSL3@O2-ICG NBs can enhance SDT and ferroptosis. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)， the differential expression of LncRNA and mRNA before and after synergistic treatment was identified， and then GO and KEGG pathways were used to enrich and analyze target genes and pathways related ferroptosis sensitivity. We found that they were significantly enriched in the ferroptosis-related pathway MAPK cascade and cell proliferation. Then， we searched for the expression of differentially expressed genes in the TCGA Hepatocellular carcinoma cohort. At the same time， we evaluated the proportion of immune cell infiltration and the identification of co-expression network modules and related prognostic analysis. We found that it was significantly related to the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic risk genes ""SLC37A2"" and ""ITGB7"" may represent new hepatocellular carcinoma ferroptosis-inducing markers and have guiding significance for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:The therapeutic effect of the in vitro synergistic treatment has been proven to be significant， revealing the prospect of 2-in-1 nanobubbles combined with SDT and ferroptosis in treating HCC.Keywords:HCC; RSL3; ferroptosis; sonodynamic therapy; synergistic therapy."

Liposomal doxorubicin attenuates cardiotoxicity via induction of interferon-related DNA damage resistance.,Cardiovasc Res, 2020 Apr 1,31346605,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31346605/,ims:The clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) is severely compromised by its cardiotoxic effects， which limit the therapeutic index and the cumulative dose. Liposomal encapsulation of DOX (Myocet®) provides a certain protective effect against cardiotoxicity by reducing myocardial drug accumulation. We aimed to evaluate transcriptomic responses to anthracyclines with different cardiotoxicity profiles in a translational large animal model for identifying potential alleviation strategies.Methods and results:We treated domestic pigs with either DOX， epirubicin (EPI)， or liposomal DOX and compared the cardiac， laboratory， and haemodynamic effects with saline-treated animals. Cardiotoxicity was encountered in all groups， reflected by an increase of plasma markers N-terminal pro-brain-natriuretic peptide and Troponin I and an impact on body weight. High morbidity of EPI-treated animals impeded further evaluation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium late enhancement and transthoracic echocardiography showed stronger reduction of the left and right ventricular systolic function and stronger myocardial fibrosis in DOX-treated animals than in those treated with the liposomal formulation. Gene expression profiles of the left and right ventricles were analysed by RNA-sequencing and validated by qPCR. Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)， linked to DNA damage repair and cell survival， were downregulated by DOX， but upregulated by liposomal DOX in both the left and right ventricle. The expression of cardioprotective translocator protein (TSPO) was inhibited by DOX， but not its liposomal formulation. Cardiac fibrosis with activation of collagen was found in all treatment groups.Conclusions:All anthracycline-derivatives resulted in transcriptional activation of collagen synthesis and processing. Liposomal packaging of DOX-induced ISGs in association with lower cardiotoxicity， which is of high clinical importance in anticancer treatment. Our study identified potential mechanisms for rational development of strategies to mitigate anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.Keywords:RNA-seq; Anthracyclines; Cardiotoxicity; DNA damage response; Large animal model; Liposomal doxorubicin.
Cytotoxicity of Thymus vulgaris essential oil towards human oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.,Anticancer Res, 2011 Jan,21273584,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21273584/,Background:Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) accounts for 2% to 3% of all malignancies and has a high mortality rate. The majority of anticancer drugs are of natural origin. However， it is unknown whether the medicinal plant Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme) is cytotoxic towards head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Materials and methods:Cytotoxicity of thyme essential oil was investigated on the HNSCC cell line， UMSCC1. The IC₅₀ of thyme essential oil extract was 369 μg/ml. Moreover， we performed pharmacogenomics analyses.Results:Genes involved in the cell cycle， cell death and cancer were involved in the cytotoxic activity of thyme essential oil at the transcriptional level. The three most significantly regulated pathways by thyme essential oil were interferon signaling， N-glycan biosynthesis and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) signaling.Conclusion:Thyme essential oil inhibits human HNSCC cell growth. Based on pharmacogenomic approaches， novel insights into the molecular mode of anticancer activity of thyme are presented.
Linezolid， vancomycin and daptomycin modulate cytokine production， Toll-like receptors and phagocytosis in a human in vitro model of sepsis.,J Antibiot (Tokyo), 2015 Aug,25735844,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735844/,Conventional antibiotics exhibit immunomodulatory properties beneficial in the treatment of sepsis. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria have become a problem in sepsis therapy， giving rise to increased use of last-resort antibiotics; for example， linezolid (LIN)， vancomycin (VAN) and daptomycin (DAP). As the immunomodulatory properties of these antibiotics in treating sepsis are unknown， this study examined the effect of VAN， LIN and DAP on the immune response under sepsis-like conditions in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated THP-1 monocytes were incubated with LIN， VAN or DAP. Gene expression of cytokines (TNFα， IL-1β， IL-6， IL-10) and Toll-like receptors (TLR1， 2， 4， 6， 7 and 9) was monitored and phagocytosis was determined following coincubation with E. coli. The antibiotics differentially modulated the gene expression of the investigated cytokines. While LIN and VAN upregulated the expression of all TLRs， DAP downregulated mRNA levels of TLR1， TLR2 and TLR6， which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from Gram-positive bacteria. In addition， LIN inhibited， whereas VAN promoted the phagocytic activity of monocytes. Our results suggest that LIN and VAN possess pro-inflammatory properties， whereas DAP might reduce the immune response to Gram-positive bacteria in sepsis. Furthermore， VAN might be beneficial in the prevention of Gram-negative infections by increasing the phagocytosis of E. coli.

Berberine induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in liver cancer cells.,Oncol Rep, 2013 Sep,23784371,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23784371/,Current chemotherapeutic strategies for liver cancer have limitations. Thus， the demand for complementary medicine is warranted. We evaluated the antitumor potential of berberine， a naturally bioactive phytochemical from Coptis chinensis Franch against Huh7 cancer cells and WRL68 liver cells. The antitumor activity of berberine was evaluated by flow cytometry. The caspase-dependent pathway was assessed using western blot analysis. Results showed that berberine induced the apoptosis of liver cancer cells through procaspase-9， and its effector caspases， procaspase-3 and procaspase-7. Flow cytometry revealed that berberine caused cell cycle arrest at the M/G1 phase. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that berberine increased the expression of Bax， which resulted in the activation of the caspase cascade. The present findings demonstrated that berberine induces the apoptosis of Huh7 cells via the mitochondrial pathway.

Long-term exposure to gefitinib induces acquired resistance through DNA methylation changes in the EGFR-mutant PC9 lung cancer cell line.,Int J Oncol, 2015 Jan,25353970,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25353970/,This study was designed to identify epigenetically regulated genes and to clarify the contribution of epige-netic alteration to acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor‑tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR‑TKIs). We established a gefitinib‑resistant lung cancer cell line， PC9， which was originally gefitinib‑sensitive， by serial long‑term exposure to gefitinib. RNA and DNA were collected from both gefitinib‑sensitive and ‑resistant PC9 cells， and comprehensive DNA methylation and mRNA expression analyses were performed using Infinium HumanMethylation27 Bead Arrays and Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K Array， respectively. DNA methylation was increased in 640 genes in gefitinib‑resistant cells compared to parental cells. Among them， we selected 29 candidate genes that presented a decrease in mRNA expression in resistant PC9. We further studied four of the selected genes (C10orf116， IGFBP3， KL， and S100P) and found that KL or S100P silencing by siRNA induced a decrease in gefitinib sensitivity compared to that in the negative control in PC9. In conclusion， KL and S100P could be potential targets to overcome resistance to EGFR‑TKIs.

Ras inhibition in glioblastoma down-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha， causing glycolysis shutdown and cell death.,Cancer Res, 2005 Feb 1,15705901,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15705901/,ive Ras and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent pathways contribute to the malignant phenotype of glioblastoma multiformes (GBM). Here we show that the Ras inhibitor trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) exhibits profound antioncogenic effects in U87 GBM cells. FTS inhibited active Ras and attenuated Ras signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase， phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase， and Akt. Concomitantly， hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) disappeared， expression of key glycolysis pathway enzymes and of other HIF-1alpha-regulated genes (including vascular endothelial growth factor and the Glut-1 glucose transporter) was down-regulated， and glycolysis was halted. This led to a dramatic reduction in ATP， resulting in a severe energy crisis. In addition， the expression of E2F-regulated genes was down-regulated in the FTS-treated cells. Consequently， U87 cell growth was arrested and the cells died. These results show that FTS is a potent down-regulator of HIF-1alpha and might therefore block invasiveness， survival， and angiogenesis in GBM.
Molecular changes consistent with increased proliferation and invasion are common in rectal cancer.,Clin Transl Oncol, 2011 Oct,21975339,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21975339/,BACKGROUND Survival in rectal cancer remains unchanged despite improved treatment modalities. Molecular biology may hold the key to new strategies. Gene expression abnormalities need identification in tumour specimens to identify targets for therapy. The impact of neoadjuvant therapy on induced gene expression changes needs to be assessed to distinguish the intrinsic tumour-specific changes from those changes that may be induced by neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS Gene expression changes were examined in 21 rectal tumours plus matched normal mucosa and cells exposed to 5-FU and gamma radiation， using DNA membrane arrays. These arrays contained 100 genes in common cancer pathways. The most commonly up-regulated gene， c-FOS， was quantified using real-time PCR. RESULTS c-FOS was the most commonly up-regulated gene， occurring in 7 of 21 samples (33%)， all samples having a greater than 2-fold increase. SERPINE-1 was the second most commonly up-regulated gene with 6 of 21 samples showing up-regulation (29%). There was no clear correlation between up-regulation of c-FOS or SERPINE-1 and clinico-pathological data. Neither c-FOS nor SERPINE-1 gene expression was induced by 5-FU treatment or gamma irradiation in vitro， but MUC 18 was up-regulated by 5-FU treatment. This suggests that FOS and SERPINE-1 expression changes are specific to the tumour and will not arise as artefacts of neoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION The study suggests that c-FOS and SERPINE-1 may have important but as yet unclear roles in the tumour biology of rectal cancer but probably only represent a small part of the complex molecular biology of rectal cancer.
Benzo[a]pyrene promotes proliferation of human lung cancer cells by accelerating the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway.,Cancer Lett, 2009 Jun 8,19181443,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19181443/,Smoking is an independent prognostic factor of lung adenocarcinoma. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is one of the strongest carcinogens and it is present in both the environment and cigarette smoke. In this study， the effect of B[a]P on the proliferative activity of lung adenocarcinoma cells was investigated. A lung adenocarcinoma cell line， A549， was cultured with B[a]P for various periods， and its proliferative activity was examined by an MTS assay. To investigate the intracellular events related to the proliferative activity， the gene expression profile was investigated by a microarray analysis and a quantitative RT-PCR， and the protein expression and activation status of Akt， ERK 1/2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were examined by a western blot analysis. Following the culture with B[a]P for 24 weeks， the serum-independent proliferative activity was increased. A microarray analysis revealed that a reversible upregulation of the EGFR and epiregulin genes was recognized in the B[a]P treated cells， in which the overexpression of the phosphorylated EGFR protein was also recognized. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor reduced the cellular proliferation and the level of phosphorylation of ERK1/2， which is a downstream signal of the EGFR， in the B[a]P-treated A549 cells. Moreover， the B[a]P treatment increased the mRNA expressions of the ligands for EGFR such as amphiregulin and epiregulin. B[a]P increases the proliferative potential of lung adenocarcinoma cells through the EGFR signaling pathway.
Molecular characterisation of MEK1/2- and MKK3/6-like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK) from the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis.,Int J Parasitol, 2010 Apr,19887070,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19887070/,Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) are essential components of evolutionary conserved signalling modules that regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes in response to environmental stimuli. To date， no MAPKK ortholog has been characterised in free-living or parasitic flatworm species. Here， we report the identification and molecular characterisation of two such molecules in the human parasitic cestode Echinococcus multilocularis， the causative agent of alveolar echinococcosis. Using degenerative PCR approaches as well as 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)， the cDNAs encoding two different E. multilocularis MAPKKs， EmMKK1 and EmMKK2， have been identified and fully cloned. Structurally， EmMKK1 and EmMKK2 closely resemble members of the MKK3/6- and the MEK1/2-MAPKK sub-families， respectively， from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms， and contain all catalytically important residues of MAPKKs at the corresponding positions. By reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses， expression of the EmMKK2-encoding gene， emmkk2， was observed in the larval stages， metacestode and protoscolex while emmkk1 displayed a protoscolex-specific expression pattern. In yeast two-hybrid analyses， EmMKK1 strongly interacted with the previously identified Echinococcus MAPKK kinase EmRaf but not with the Erk-like MAP kinase EmMPK1 or the p38-like MAP kinase EmMPK2. EmMKK2， on the other hand， not only interacted with EmRaf and a member of the parasite's 14-3-3 protein family， but also with EmMPK1， which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Incubation of in vitro cultivated metacestode vesicles with small-molecule inhibitors of Raf- and MEK-kinases resulted in a marked de-phosphorylation of EmMPK1 and negatively affected parasite growth， but was ineffective in vesicle killing. Taken together， our results define EmRaf， EmMKK2 and EmMPK1 as the three components of the Erk-like E. multilocularis MAPK cascade module and provide a solid basis for further investigations into the role of Erk-like MAPK signalling in parasite development and stem cell function.
Extracellular heat shock protein 70 promotes osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells through activation of the ERK signaling pathway.,FEBS Lett, 2015 Dec 21,26608032,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26608032/,Heat shock proteins have protective effects when cells are exposed to stress. However， the relationship between extracellular heat shock protein 70 (eHSP70) and osteogenesis of hMSCs has not been reported. The results of this study showed that HSP70 (200 ng/ml) increases alkaline phosphatase activity and promotes hMSC mineralization. Under osteogenic induction conditions， HSP70 significantly upregulated the expression of osteo-specific genes， such as the runt family transcription factor Runx2 and osterix (OSX). Comparative expression profiling by microarray and pathway analyses revealed that HSP70 promotes osteogenesis of hMSCs through activation of the ERK signaling pathway. HSP70 may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of bone nonunion.Keywords:Bone nonunion; ERK signaling pathway; Extracellular HSP70; Human mesenchymal stem cell; Osteogenesis.
Genistein induces the p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16INK4a tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer cells by epigenetic mechanisms involving active chromatin modification.,Cancer Res, 2008 Apr 15,18413741,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18413741/,Genistein (4'，5，7-trihydroxyisoflavone) is the most abundant isoflavone found in the soybean. The effects of genistein on various cancer cell lines have been extensively studied but the precise molecular mechanisms are not known. We report here the epigenetic mechanism of the action of genistein on androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive (DuPro) human prostate cancer cell lines. Genistein induced the expression of tumor suppressor genes p21 (WAF1/CIP1/KIP1) and p16 (INK4a) with a concomitant decrease in cyclins. There was a G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest in LNCaP cells and a G(2)-M arrest in DuPro cells after genistein treatment. Genistein also induced apoptosis in DuPro cells. DNA methylation analysis revealed the absence of p21 promoter methylation in both cell lines. The effect of genistein on chromatin remodeling has not been previously reported. We found that genistein increased acetylated histones 3， 4， and H3/K4 at the p21 and p16 transcription start sites. Furthermore， we found that genistein treatment also increased the expression of histone acetyl transferases that function in transcriptional activation. This is the first report on epigenetic regulation of various genes by genistein through chromatin remodeling in prostate cancer. Altogether， our data provide new insights into the epigenetic mechanism of the action of genistein that may contribute to the chemopreventive activity of this dietary isoflavone and have important implications for epigenetic therapy.
Efflux protein expression in human stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells.,PLoS One, 2012,22272278,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22272278/,Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the back of the eye nourish photoreceptor cells and form a selective barrier that influences drug transport from the blood to the photoreceptor cells. At the molecular level， ATP-dependent efflux transporters have a major role in drug delivery in human RPE. In this study， we assessed the relative expression of several ATP-dependent efflux transporter genes (MRP1， -2， -3， -4， -5， -6， p-gp， and BCRP)， the protein expression and localization of MRP1， MRP4， and MRP5， and the functionality of MRP1 efflux pumps at different maturation stages of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and RPE derived from the hESC (hESC-RPE). Our findings revealed that the gene expression of ATP-dependent efflux transporters MRP1， -3， -4， -5， and p-gp fluctuated during hESC-RPE maturation from undifferentiated hESC to fusiform， epithelioid， and finally to cobblestone hESC-RPE. Epithelioid hESC-RPE had the highest expression of MRP1， -3， -4， and P-gp， whereas the most mature cobblestone hESC-RPE had the highest expression of MRP5 and MRP6. These findings indicate that a similar efflux protein profile is shared between hESC-RPE and the human RPE cell line， ARPE-19， and suggest that hESC-RPE cells are suitable in vitro RPE models for drug transport studies. Embryonic stem cell model might provide a novel tool to study retinal cell differentiation， mechanisms of RPE-derived diseases， drug testing and targeted drug therapy.
Reactive oxygen species are not required for an arsenic trioxide-induced antioxidant response or apoptosis.,J Biol Chem, 2009 May 8,19279006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19279006/,enicals are both environmental carcinogens as well as therapeutic agents for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and more recently cancer. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been successfully used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and has activity in multiple myeloma (MM). While signaling events associated with carcinogenesis have been well studied， it still remains to be determined which of these events are involved in anti-cancer signaling. To better define this response， gene expression profiling following ATO treatment of four MM cell lines was performed. The pattern was consistent with a strong antioxidative response， particularly of genes activated by Nrf2. While Nrf2 is expressed constitutively at the mRNA level， the protein is not detected in untreated cells. Consistent with inactivation of Keap1， Nrf2 protein is stabilized and present in the nucleus within 6 h of ATO treatment. Despite the activation of this antioxidative response， ROS may not be important in ATO-induced death. Inhibition of ATO-induced ROS with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) does not affect Nrf2 activation or cell death. Moreover， silencing Nrf2 had no effect on ATO-induced apoptosis. Together these data suggest that ROS is not important in the induction of the antioxidative response or cellular death by ATO.
Gene expression in human mesenchymal stem cell aging cultures: modulation by short peptides.,Mol Biol Rep, 2020 Jun,32399807,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32399807/,"Effects of the short peptides Ala-Glu-Asp (AED)， Lys-Glu-Asp (KED) and Lys-Glu (KE) on the expression of IGF1， FOXO1， TERT， TNKS2， and NFκB genes were studied in human embryo bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (line FetMSCs) variously aged in ""passages"" or ""stationary"" cultures. Both cell aging models were similar in gene expression. The main difference was in the TERT gene expression level， which showed an eightfold increase at the ""stationary"" aging. IGF1 gene expression levels were very similar in both cell culture aging models， being enhanced by 3.5-5.6 fold upon the addition of the peptides. The FOXO1 gene was expressed twice more actively in the ""stationary"" than in the ""passages"" aging model. KED peptide inhibited FOXO1 gene expression by 1.6-2.3 fold. KE peptide increased FOXO1 gene expression by about two-fold in the ""stationary"" aging model but did not affect it in the ""passage"" aging model. The most striking difference in the peptide effect on cell aging between ""passages"" and ""stationary"" aging models was in the KED effects on TNKS2 gene expression; this expression was inhibited by KED in the ""passages"" model， while stimulation was observed in the ""stationary"" model. AED， KED， and KE stimulated expression of the NFκB gene in both models. Thus， the peptides studied at nanomolar concentrations modulate the expression of some genes known to be involved in cell aging.Keywords:Cell aging; Genes; Human mesenchymal stem cells; Short peptides."
Recombinant duck enteritis virus expressing the HA gene from goose H5 subtype avian influenza virus.,Vaccine, 2013 Dec 5,24144474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24144474/,The duck enteritis virus (DEV) may be a promising candidate viral vector for an aquatic poultry vaccination that can protect against multiple pathogens because it has a very large genome and a narrow host range. Recently， we described two DEV recombinants that contained deletions of the viral US2 or gIgE genes. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of an H5N1-type highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of goose origin was inserted into the deletion sites to construct two rDEVs expressing the AIV HA antigen. The resulting rDEV-ΔgIgE-HA or rDEV-ΔUS2-HA recombinant DEV viruses were used to infect duck embryo fibroblasts. Reverse transcription PCR， immunofluorescence and western blot analysis results indicated that rDEV-ΔgIgE-HA and rDEV-ΔUS2-HA were successfully expressed in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs). To investigate whether the HA gene could be stably maintained in the recombinant viruses， the viruses were passaged in DEFs 18 times. The HA gene in both recombinants could be detected by PCR amplification. The immunized four-week-old ducks induced specific antibodies against DEV and AIV HA and were protected against challenge infections with DEV AV1221 viruses.Keywords:CEF; CPE; DEF; DEV; Duck enteritis virus (DEV); Goose origin; H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV); HA; HPAIV; Hemagglutinin (HA); US; chicken embryo fibroblast; cytopathic effects; duck embryo fibroblast; duck enteritis virus; gE; gEBn; gEBw; gI; glycoprotein E; glycoprotein I; hemagglutinin; highly pathogenic avian influenza virus; post-vaccination; pv; rDEV; recombinant DEV; the extracellular region of gE gene; the intracellular region of gE gene; unique short; wild type DEV; wtDEV.
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma on human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,Oncol Rep, 2016 Jul,27222202,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27222202/, large volume of data indicates that controlling tumor-associated angiogenesis is a promising therapy against cancer. However， angiogenesis is a complex process， little is known about the differential gene expression in the process of normal endothelial cell differentiation toward tumor vascular endothelial cells induced by tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of tumor microenvironment simulated by the supernatant of esophageal squamous cancer cells (KYSE70) on normal endothelial cells (HUVECs) at the whole genome level. The gene expression profile was studied through gene ontology and signal pathway analysis. Compared with the normal HUVECs， a total of 3769 differentially expressed genes in induced HUVECs were detected， including 1609 upregulated genes and 2160 downregulated genes. Moreover， the microarray data analysis showed that 11 significant biological processes and 10 significant signaling pathways changed most， which are associated with angiogenesis and cell differentiation. According to the different expression levels in the microarrays and their functions， four differentially expressed genes involved in tumor angiogenesis and cell differentiation (IL6， VEGFA， S1PR1， TYMP) were selected and analyzed by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with the microarray data. Furthermore， we simulated the tumor microenvironment by human esophageal carcinoma tissue homogenate to investigate its effect on HUVECs， the qRT-PCR results indicated that the above genes were highly expressed in HUVECs after induction by esophageal carcinoma tissue homogenate. In conclusion， tumor microenvironment impact on normal endothelial cells differentiated toward tumor vascular endothelial cells， and the selected genes， which are associated with tumor angiogenesis， would be anti-angiogenesis targets against esophageal carcinoma.
Synthesis and biological activity of a 3，4，5-trimethoxybenzoyl ester analogue of epicatechin-3-gallate.,J Med Chem, 2008 Apr 10,18324763,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18324763/,Despite presenting bioavailability problems， tea catechins have emerged as promising chemopreventive agents because of their observed efficacy in various animal models. To improve the stability and cellular absorption of tea polyphenols， we developed a new catechin-derived compound， 3- O-(3，4，5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(-)-epicatechin (TMECG)， which has shown significant antiproliferative activity against several cancer cell lines， especially melanoma. The presence of methoxy groups in its ester-bound gallyl moiety drastically decreased its antioxidant and prooxidant properties without affecting its cell-antiproliferative effects， and the data indicated that the 3-gallyl moiety was essential for its biological activity. As regards its action mechanism， we demonstrated that TMECG binds efficiently to human dihydrofolate reductase and down-regulates folate cycle gene expression in melanoma cells. Disruption of the folate cycle by TMECG is a plausible explanation for its observed biological effects and suggests that， like other antifolate compounds， TMECG could be of clinical value in cancer therapy.
Androgen receptor promotes tamoxifen agonist activity by activation of EGFR in ERalpha-positive breast cancer.,Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2015 Nov,26487496,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26487496/,Tamoxifen (Tam) resistance represents a significant clinical problem in estrogen receptor (ER) α-positive breast cancer. We previously showed that decreased expression of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (Rho GDI) α， a negative regulator of the Rho GTPase pathway， is associated with Tam resistance. We now discover that androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed in cells with decreased Rho GDIα and seek to determine AR's contribution to resistance. We engineered ERα-positive cell lines with stable knockdown (KD) of Rho GDIα (KD cells). Resistance mechanisms were examined using microarray profiling， protein-interaction studies， growth and reporter gene assays， and Western blot analysis combined with a specific AR antagonist and other signaling inhibitors. Tam-resistant tumors and cell lines with low Rho GDIα levels exhibited upregulated AR expression. Microarray of Rho GDIα KD cells indicated that activation of EGFR and ERα was associated with Tam treatment. When AR levels were elevated， interaction between AR and EGFR was detected. Constitutive and Tam-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 was blocked by the AR antagonist Enzalutamide， suggesting that AR-mediated EGFR activation was a mechanism of resistance in these cells. Constitutive ERα phosphorylation and transcriptional activity was inhibited by Enzalutamide and the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib， demonstrating that AR-mediated EGFR signaling activated ERα. Tam exhibited agonist activity in AR overexpressing cells， stimulating ERα transcriptional activity and proliferation， which was blocked by Enzalutamide and gefitinib. We describe a novel model of AR-mediated Tam resistance through activation of EGFR signaling leading to ER activation in ERα-positive cells with low expression of Rho GDIα.Keywords:Androgen receptor; Breast cancer; Endocrine therapy resistance; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Estrogen receptor; Tamoxifen.
Model-driven discovery of long-chain fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in heterogeneous prostate cancer cells.,PLoS Comput Biol, 2018 Jan 2,29293497,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29293497/,Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity， by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model， PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential， while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria， PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis， cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid， a long-chain fatty acid with antiproliferative effects. The potential therapeutic significance of our model was supported by a differential sensitivity of PC-3/M cells to etomoxir， an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid transport to the mitochondria.
MiR-21 is an EGFR-regulated anti-apoptotic factor in lung cancer in never-smokers.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2009 Jul 21,19597153,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19597153/,Fifteen percent of lung cancer cases occur in never-smokers and show characteristics that are molecularly and clinically distinct from those in smokers. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations， which are correlated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs)， are more frequent in never-smoker lung cancers. In this study， microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 28 cases of never-smoker lung cancer identified aberrantly expressed miRNAs， which were much fewer than in lung cancers of smokers and included miRNAs previously identified (e.g.， up-regulated miR-21) and unidentified (e.g.， down-regulated miR-138) in those smoker cases. The changes in expression of some of these miRNAs， including miR-21， were more remarkable in cases with EGFR mutations than in those without these mutations. A significant correlation between phosphorylated-EGFR (p-EGFR) and miR-21 levels in lung carcinoma cell lines and the suppression of miR-21 by an EGFR-TKI， AG1478， suggest that the EGFR signaling is a pathway positively regulating miR-21 expression. In the never-smoker-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line H3255 with mutant EGFR and high levels of p-EGFR and miR-21， antisense inhibition of miR-21 enhanced AG1478-induced apoptosis. In a never-smoker-derived adenocarcinoma cell line H441 with wild-type EGFR， the antisense miR-21 not only showed the additive effect with AG1478 but also induced apoptosis by itself. These results suggest that aberrantly increased expression of miR-21， which is enhanced further by the activated EGFR signaling pathway， plays a significant role in lung carcinogenesis in never-smokers， as well as in smokers， and is a potential therapeutic target in both EGFR-mutant and wild-type cases.
miR-200 expression regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in bladder cancer cells and reverses resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor therapy.,Clin Cancer Res, 2009 Aug 15,19671845,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19671845/,Purpose:The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cell development-regulated process in which noncoding RNAs act as crucial modulators. Recent studies have implied that EMT may contribute to resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy. The aims of this study were to determine the potential role of microRNAs (miRNA) in controlling EMT and the role of EMT in inducing the sensitivity of human bladder cancer cells to the inhibitory effects of the anti-EGFR therapy.Experimental design:miRNA array screening and real-time reverse transcription-PCR were used to identify and validate the differential expression of miRNAs involved in EMT in nine bladder cancer cell lines. A list of potential miR-200 direct targets was identified through the TargetScan database. The precursor of miR-200b and miR-200c was expressed in UMUC3 and T24 cells using a retrovirus or a lentivirus construct， respectively. Protein expression and signaling pathway modulation， as well as intracellular distribution of EGFR and ERRFI-1， were validated through Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy， whereas ERRFI-1 direct target of miR-200 members was validated by using the wild-type and mutant 3'-untranslated region/ERRFI-1/luciferse reporters.Results:We identified a tight association between the expression of miRNAs of the miR-200 family， epithelial phenotype， and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors-induced growth inhibition in bladder carcinoma cell lines. Stable expression of miR-200 in mesenchymal UMUC3 cells increased E-cadherin levels， decreased expression of ZEB1， ZEB2， ERRFI-1， and cell migration， and increased sensitivity to EGFR-blocking agents. The changes in EGFR sensitivity by silencing or forced expression of ERRFI-1 or by miR-200 expression have also been validated in additional cell lines， UMUC5 and T24. Finally， luciferase assays using 3'-untranslated region/ERRFI-1/luciferase and miR-200 cotransfections showed that the direct down-regulation of ERRFI-1 was miR-200-dependent because mutations in the two putative miR-200-binding sites have rescued the inhibitory effect.Conclusions:Members of the miR-200 family appear to control the EMT process and sensitivity to EGFR therapy in bladder cancer cells and the expression of miR-200 is sufficient to restore EGFR dependency at least in some of the mesenchymal bladder cancer cells. The targets of miR-200 include ERRFI-1， which is a novel regulator of EGFR-independent growth.
Transcriptomic analysis of the host response to early stage salmonid alphavirus (SAV-1) infection in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L.,Fish Shellfish Immunol, 2012 May,22365992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22365992/,Salmon pancreas disease， caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV) of the family Togaviridae， is an economically important disease affecting farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Scotland， Norway， and Ireland. The virus causes characteristic lesions in the pancreas， heart， kidney and skeletal muscle of infected fish. The mechanisms responsible for the pathology and the immune responses elicited in infected Atlantic salmon are not fully understood. A microarray-based study was therefore performed to evaluate the host transcriptomic response during the early stages of an experimentally-induced SAV-1 infection. Atlantic salmon parr were injected intra-peritoneally with viral cell culture supernatant or cell culture supernatant without virus. RNA， extracted from head kidney sampled from infected and control fish at 1， 3 and 5 days post-injection (d.p.i.)， was interrogated with the 17 k TRAITS/SGP cDNA microarray. The greatest number of significantly differentially expressed genes was recorded at 3 d.p.i.， mainly associated with immune and defence mechanisms， including genes involved in interferon I pathways and Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I and II responses. Genes associated with apoptosis and cellular stress were also found to be differentially expressed between infected and uninfected individuals， as were genes involved in inhibiting viral attachment and replication. The microarray results were validated by follow-on analysis of eight genes by real-time PCR. The findings of the study reflect mechanisms used by the host to protect itself during the early stages of SAV-1 infection. In particular， there was evidence of rapid induction of interferon-mediated responses similar to those seen during mammalian alphavirus infections， and also early involvement of an adaptive immune response. This study provides essential knowledge to assist in the development of effective control and management strategies for SAV-1 infection.
Prolonged exposure to (R)-bicalutamide generates a LNCaP subclone with alteration of mitochondrial genome.,Mol Cell Endocrinol, 2014 Jan 25,24397920,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24397920/,dvanced prostate cancers， initially sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy， frequently progress to the castration-resistant prostate cancer phenotype (CRPC) through mechanisms not yet fully understood. In this study we investigated mitochondrial involvement in the establishment of refractoriness to hormone therapy. Two human prostate cancer cell lines were used， the parental LNCaP and the resistant LNCaP-Rbic， the latter generated after continuous exposure to 20 μM of (R)-bicalutamide， the active enantiomer of Casodex®. We observed a significant decrease in mtDNA content and a lower expression of 8 mitochondria-encoded gene transcripts involved in respiratory chain complexes in both cell lines. We also found that (R)-bicalutamide differentially modulated dynamin-related protein (Drp-1) expression in LNCaP and LNCaP-Rbic cells. These data seem to indicate that the androgen-independent phenotype in our experimental model was due， at least in part， to alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and to a breakdown in the Drp-1-mediated mitochondrial network.Keywords:(R)-bicalutamide; Hormone-resistance; Mitochondrial fission; MtDNA; Prostate cancer.
Adaphostin toxicity in a sensitive non-small cell lung cancer model is mediated through Nrf2 signaling and heme oxygenase 1.,J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 2010 Jul 9,20618971,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20618971/,Background:Preclinical toxicity of adaphostin has been related to oxidative stress. This study investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying adaphostin induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) which plays a significant role in modulation of drug-induced toxicity in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line model， NCI-H522.Methods:The transcriptional response of NCI-H522 to adaphostin prominently involved oxidative stress genes， particularly HMOX1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was additionally established by generation of ROS prior to modulation of adaphostin-toxicity with antioxidants. To identify up-stream regulatory elements of HMOX1， immunofluorescence was used to evaluate nuclear translocation of the transcription factor， NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)， in the presence of adaphostin. The PI3-kinase inhibitor， wortmannin， was employed as a pharmacological inhibitor of this process.Results:Generation of ROS provided a substantial foundation for the sensitivity of NCI-H522 to adaphostin. However， in contrast to leukemia cell lines， transcriptional response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of HMOX1， which was dependent on nuclear translocation of the transcription factor， Nrf2. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin inhibited translocation of Nrf2 and induction of HMOX1. Wortmannin pretreatment was also able to diminish adaphostin induction of HMOX1， and as a consequence， enhance the toxicity of adaphostin to NCI-H522.Conclusions:Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress in NCI-H522 was mediated through nuclear translocation of Nrf2 leading to upregulation of HMOX1. Inhibition of Nrf2 translocation by wortmannin inhibited this cytoprotective response， and enhanced the toxicity of adaphostin， suggesting that inhibitors of the PI3K pathway， such as wortmannin， might augment the antiproliferative effects of adaphostin in solid tumors that depend on the Nrf2/ARE pathway for protection against oxidative stress.
SCL/TAL1-mediated transcriptional network enhances megakaryocytic specification of human embryonic stem cells.,Mol Ther, 2015 Jan,25292191,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25292191/,Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique in vitro model for studying human developmental biology and represent a potential source for cell replacement strategies. Platelets can be generated from cord blood progenitors and hESCs; however， the molecular mechanisms and determinants controlling the in vitro megakaryocytic specification of hESCs remain elusive. We have recently shown that stem cell leukemia (SCL) overexpression accelerates the emergence of hemato-endothelial progenitors from hESCs and promotes their subsequent differentiation into blood cells with higher clonogenic potential. Given that SCL participates in megakaryocytic commitment， we hypothesized that it may potentiate megakaryopoiesis from hESCs. We show that ectopic SCL expression enhances the emergence of megakaryocytic precursors， mature megakaryocytes (MKs)， and platelets in vitro. SCL-overexpressing MKs and platelets respond to different activating stimuli similar to their control counterparts. Gene expression profiling of megakaryocytic precursors shows that SCL overexpression renders a megakaryopoietic molecular signature. Connectivity Map analysis reveals that trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)， both histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors， functionally mimic SCL-induced effects. Finally， we confirm that both TSA and SAHA treatment promote the emergence of CD34(+) progenitors， whereas valproic acid， another HDAC inhibitor， potentiates MK and platelet production. We demonstrate that SCL and HDAC inhibitors are megakaryopoiesis regulators in hESCs.
Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis confirms RBMS3 as the central candidate biological target for ovarian cancer.,Med Eng Phys, 2022 Dec,36075788,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075788/,Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in the female reproductive system. To find genes related to cancer progression targeting specific biological factors for targeted therapy， bioinformatics technology has been widely used. To screen the prognostic gene markers of OC by bioinformatics and explore their potential molecular biological mechanisms. Two data sets related to OC， GSE54388， and GSE119056， were rooted in the open comprehensive gene expression database (GEO). To correct the background of the data， standardize and screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the R software limma package. The selected DEGs were enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and through DAVID online database. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction network (PPI-network) map were constructed by STRING online database and Cytoscape software. Combined with the TCGA database， univariate and multivariate COX regression were used to screen prognostic genes. QRT-PCR was used to verify DEGs in clinical tissue samples. Eventually， the function of RBMS3 on the viability， migration， invasion， and apoptosis of OC cells was tested through functional experiments in vitro. 352 common DEGs were screened from GSE54388 and GSE119056 data sets. Survival analysis showed that MEIS2， TSTA3， CNTN1， RBMS3， and TRA2A were considered to be connected with the prognosis of OC. We discover that the expression level of RBMS3 was positively connected with the overall survival (OS) rate of sufferers with OC. The level of RBMS3 in OC tissues was markedly lower than that in neighboring structures and the outcomes of the GEPIA database were consistent with those of the qRT-PCR experiment. Through gene transfection technology it was found that overexpression of RBMS3 in OC cells substantially suppressed the vitality， migration， and invasion of OC cells and raised the rates of apoptosis in the OC cells. In this experiment， we distinguish 5 genes that may participate in the prognosis of OC and showed the key genes and pathways related to OC. It is speculated that RBMS3， a tumor suppressor gene， can be applied as a potential biological marker for the treatment of OC， gene expression summary， and prognosis.Keywords:Bioinformatics analysis; Molecular biology technology; Ovarian cancer; RBMS3.
Systematic microRNA analysis identifies ATP6V0C as an essential host factor for human cytomegalovirus replication.,PLoS Pathog, 2013,24385903,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24385903/,Recent advances in microRNA target identification have greatly increased the number of putative targets of viral microRNAs. However， it is still unclear whether all targets identified are biologically relevant. Here， we use a combined approach of RISC immunoprecipitation and focused siRNA screening to identify targets of HCMV encoded human cytomegalovirus that play an important role in the biology of the virus. Using both a laboratory and clinical strain of human cytomegalovirus， we identify over 200 putative targets of human cytomegalovirus microRNAs following infection of fibroblast cells. By comparing RISC-IP profiles of miRNA knockout viruses， we have resolved specific interactions between human cytomegalovirus miRNAs and the top candidate target transcripts and validated regulation by western blot analysis and luciferase assay. Crucially we demonstrate that miRNA target genes play important roles in the biology of human cytomegalovirus as siRNA knockdown results in marked effects on virus replication. The most striking phenotype followed knockdown of the top target ATP6V0C， which is required for endosomal acidification. siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0C resulted in almost complete loss of infectious virus production， suggesting that an HCMV microRNA targets a crucial cellular factor required for virus replication. This study greatly increases the number of identified targets of human cytomegalovirus microRNAs and demonstrates the effective use of combined miRNA target identification and focused siRNA screening for identifying novel host virus interactions.
Distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of the stress induced protein DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153.,PLoS One, 2012,22496745,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22496745/,DDIT3， also known as GADD153 or CHOP， encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor of the dimer forming C/EBP family. DDIT3 is known as a key regulator of cellular stress response， but its target genes and functions are not well characterized. Here， we applied a genome wide microarray based expression analysis to identify DDIT3 target genes and functions. By analyzing cells carrying tamoxifen inducible DDIT3 expression constructs we show distinct gene expression profiles for cells with cytoplasmic and nuclear localized DDIT3. Of 175 target genes identified only 3 were regulated by DDIT3 in both cellular localizations. More than two thirds of the genes were downregulated， supporting a role for DDIT3 as a dominant negative factor that could act by either cytoplasmic or nuclear sequestration of dimer forming transcription factor partners. Functional annotation of target genes showed cell migration， proliferation and apoptosis/survival as the most affected categories. Cytoplasmic DDIT3 affected more migration associated genes， while nuclear DDIT3 regulated more cell cycle controlling genes. Cell culture experiments confirmed that cytoplasmic DDIT3 inhibited migration， while nuclear DDIT3 caused a G1 cell cycle arrest. Promoters of target genes showed no common sequence motifs， reflecting that DDIT3 forms heterodimers with several alternative transcription factors that bind to different motifs. We conclude that expression of cytoplasmic DDIT3 regulated 94 genes. Nuclear translocation of DDIT3 regulated 81 additional genes linked to functions already affected by cytoplasmic DDIT3. Characterization of DDIT3 regulated functions helps understanding its role in stress response and involvement in cancer and degenerative disorders.
Mitochondrial and caspase pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis by IB-MECA in ovarian cancer cell lines.,Tumour Biol, 2014 Nov,25095978,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25095978/,3 adenosine receptor agonist (IB-MECA) has been shown to play important roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines. The present study was designed to understand the mechanism underlying IB-MECA-induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cell lines. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of A3 adenosine receptor were detected in OVCAR-3 and Caov-4 ovarian cancer cells. IB-MECA was capable of decreasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) that was the reason for the presence of functional A3 adenosine receptor on the cell lines. IB-MECA significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity of IB-MECA was suppressed by MRS1220， an A3 adenosine receptor antagonist. The growth inhibition effect of IB-MECA was related to the induction of cell apoptosis， which was manifested by annexin V-FITC staining， activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9， and loss of mitochondrial membrane potentials (ΔΨm). In addition， downregulation of the regulatory protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax protein by IB-MECA were also observed. These findings demonstrated that IB-MECA induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial signaling pathway. These suggest that A3 adenosine receptor agonists may be a potential agent for induction of apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells.
Epigenetic down-regulation of CDKN1C/p57KIP2 in pancreatic ductal neoplasms identified by gene expression profiling.,Clin Cancer Res, 2005 Jul 1,16000561,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16000561/,Purpose:Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is an increasingly identified precursor to infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma. Although our knowledge of the clinical and pathologic features of IPMNs is increasing， the molecular mechanisms underlying these neoplasms remain poorly understood.Experimental designs:To provide further insight into the molecular pathobiology of IPMNs， global expression profiling was done to determine genes that are inactivated/down-regulated in IPMNs using oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix).Results:In total， 300 unique transcripts (217 known genes) were identified as highly underexpressed in 12 IPMNs (<10-fold lower and P < 0.05) compared with five normal pancreatic ductal epithelium samples obtained by laser capture microdissection. The differential expression of a selection of genes was confirmed using reverse-transcription PCR. One of the genes underexpressed at both the transcriptional and protein level in a significant proportion of IPMNs was the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor， CDKN1C/p57KIP2. CDKN1C expression was also decreased in many pancreatic cancer cell lines and was restored following treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor (5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine) or， more potently， with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A). Partial methylation of the CDKN1C promoter CpG island was found in most， but not all， pancreatic cancer cell lines with reduced CDKN1C expression， and was also detectable in IPMNs. Furthermore， a subset of pancreatic cancers showed complete hypomethylation of LIT1， an imprinting control region important for the regulation of CDKN1C expression. Complete hypomethylation in these cancers was the result of deletion of the methylated LIT1 allele at 11p15.5 rather than loss of imprinting.Conclusions:These findings suggest that CDKN1C is commonly down-regulated in pancreatic ductal neoplasms through a combination of promoter hypermethylation， histone deacetylation， and loss of the maternal allele expressing CDKN1C.
PTTG2 silencing results in induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis.,Cell Death Dis, 2013 Mar 7,23470537,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23470537/,Human securin， also known as human pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (pttg1)， plays a key role in cell-cycle regulation. Two homologous genes， pttg2 and pttg3， have been identified although very little is known about their physiological function. In this study， we aimed at the characterization of these two pttg1 homologs. Real-time PCR analysis using specific probes demonstrated that Pttg2 is expressed at very low levels in various cell lines and tissues whereas Pttg3 was largely undetectable. We focused on the study of Pttg2 and found that， unlike PTTG1， PTTG2 lacks transactivation activity and does not bind to separase， making improbable a role in the control of sister chromatids separation. To further investigate the biological role of pttg2， we used short hairpin RNA inhibition of Pttg2 and found that cells with reduced Pttg2 levels assumed a rounded morphology compatible with a defect in cell adhesion and died by apoptosis in a p53- and p21-dependent manner. Using microarray technology， we generated a gene expression profile of Pttg2-depleted cells versus wild-type cells and found that knockdown of PTTG2 results in concomitant downregulation of E-cadherin and elevated vimentin levels， consistent with EMT induction. The observation of aberrant cellular behaviors in Pttg2-silenced cells reveals functions for pttg2 in cell adhesion and provides insights into a potential role in cell invasion.

Combination therapy with gossypol reveals synergism against gemcitabine resistance in cancer cells with high BCL-2 expression.,PLoS One, 2012,23226540,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23226540/,lthough gemcitabine is highly active in several cancer types， intrinsic and acquired drug resistance remains a major challenge. Overexpression of Bcl-2 has been associated with gemcitabine resistance. The aim of this study is to determine whether gossypol can overcome gemcitabine resistance in cell lines with high level of Bcl-2 expression in combination drug therapy. Our study demonstrated that in 10 cell lines derived from different cancers， high Bcl-2 baseline expression was observed in cell lines that were resistant to gemcitabine (GEM-R). Furthermore， synergistic effect of combination therapy was observed in gemcitabine-resistant (GEM-R) cell lines with high Bcl-2 expression， but not in a gemcitabine-sensitive (GEM-S) cell lines regardless of Bcl-2 expression. Gossypol treatment resulted in the decrease of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene， Noxa. Furthermore， the addition of gossypol to gemcitabine resulted in lower expressions of anti-apoptotic genes compared to gemcitabine alone. Gene expression profiling in GEM-R and GEM-S cell lines suggest that anti-apoptotic genes such as pAkt and PI3KR2 may play important role in gemcitabine resistance， while pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 related genes (Bad， Caspase-6 and Calpain-1) may regulate synergistic interaction in combination therapy.
Molecular effectors and modulators of hypericin-mediated cell death in bladder cancer cells.,Oncogene, 2008 Mar 20,17952126,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17952126/,Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anticancer approach utilizing a light-absorbing molecule and visible light irradiation to generate， in the presence of O(2)， cytotoxic reactive oxygen species， which cause tumor ablation. Given that the photosensitizer hypericin is under consideration for PDT treatment of bladder cancer we used oligonucleotide microarrays in the T24 bladder cancer cell line to identify differentially expressed genes with therapeutic potential. This study reveals that the expression of several genes involved in various metabolic processes， stress-induced cell death， autophagy， proliferation， inflammation and carcinogenesis is strongly affected by PDT and pinpoints the coordinated induction of a cluster of genes involved in the unfolded protein response pathway after endoplasmic reticulum stress and in antioxidant response. Analysis of PDT-treated cells after p38(MAPK) inhibition or silencing unraveled that the induction of an important subset of differentially expressed genes regulating growth and invasion， as well as adaptive mechanisms against oxidative stress， is governed by this stress-activated kinase. Moreover， p38(MAPK) inhibition blocked autonomous regrowth and migration of cancer cells escaping PDT-induced cell death. This analysis identifies new molecular effectors of the cancer cell response to PDT opening attractive avenues to improve the therapeutic efficacy of hypericin-based PDT of bladder cancer.

MiR-150-5p May Contribute to Pathogenesis of Human Leiomyoma via Regulation of the Akt/p27(Kip1) Pathway In Vitro.,Int J Mol Sci, 2019 May 31,31159158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159158/,Uterine leiomyoma is found in ~50-80% of women of a reproductive age and is the most common reason for hysterectomy. Recently， posttranscriptional gene silencing by microRNAs (miRs) has been reported as a mechanism for regulating gene expression stability in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas. In this study， miR microarray analysis of leiomyomas and paired myometrial tissue revealed numerous aberrantly expressed miRs， including miR-150. In functional assays， transfection with miR-150 mimic resulted in decreased migration and fibrosis， implying an inhibition of leiomyoma growth. To identify the target genes of miR-150 in leiomyoma， gene set analysis and network analysis were performed. To overcome the limitations of in silico analysis， changes in expression levels of hallmark genes in leiomyoma after transfection with a miR-150 mimic were also evaluated using qRT-PCR. As a result， the Akt/p27Kip1pathway was presumed to be one of the target pathways of miR-150. After transfecting cultured leiomyoma cells with the miR-150 mimic， expression levels of its target gene Akt decreased， whereas those of p27Kip1increased significantly. Our results suggest that miR-150 affects the cell cycle regulation in uterine leiomyoma through the Akt/p27Kip1pathway.Keywords:Akt; leiomyoma; microRNA 150-5p; p27Kip1.

All-trans retinoic acid induces p62DOK1 and p56DOK2 expression which enhances induced differentiation and G0 arrest of HL-60 leukemia cells.,Am J Hematol, 2006 Aug,16823827,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16823827/,p62(DOK1) (DOK1) and p56(DOK2) (DOK2) are sequence homologs that act as docking proteins downstream of receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Originally identified in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells as a highly phosphorylated substrate for the chimeric p210(bcr-abl) protein， DOK1 was suspected to play a role in leukemogenesis. However， p62(DOK1-/-) fibroblast knockout cells were found to have enhanced MAPK signaling and proliferation due to growth factors， suggesting negative regulatory capabilities for DOK1. The role of DOK1 and DOK2 in leukemogeneis thus is enigmatic. The data in this report show that both the DOK1 and the DOK2 adaptor proteins are constitutively expressed in the myelomonoblastic leukemia cell line， HL-60， and that expression of both proteins is induced by the chemotherapeutic differentiation causing agents， all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 1，25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). Ectopic expression of either protein enhances atRA- or VD3-induced growth arrest， differentiation， and G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and results in increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. DOK1 and DOK2 are similarly effective in these capabilities. The data provide evidence that DOK1 and DOK2 proteins have a similar role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and are positive regulators of the MAPK signaling pathway in this context.

PTPN21-CDSlong isoform inhibits the response of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to NK-mediated lysis via the KIR/HLA-I axis.,J Cell Biochem, 2020 Jun,31898344,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31898344/,Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 21 (PTPN21) is a member of the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase family. We have found that PTPN21 is mutated in relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. PTPN21 consists of three types of isoforms according to the length of the protein encoded. However， the roles of different isoforms in leukemic cells have not been elucidated. In the study， PTPN21 isoform constitution in five ALL cell lines were identified by transcriptome polymerase chain reaction combined with Sanger sequencing， and the relationship between PTPN21 isoforms and sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cells mediated killing in ALL cell lines were further assessed by knock-out of different isoforms of PTPN21 using CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Subsequently， we explored the functional mechanisms through RNA sequencing and confirmatory testing. The results showed that there was no significant change when all PTPN21 isoforms were knocked out in ALL cells， but the sensitivity of NALM6 cells with PTPN21-CDSlongknock-out (NALM6-PTPN21lk) to NK-mediated killing was significantly increased. Whole transcriptome sequencing and further validation testing showed that human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules were significantly decreased， accompanied by a significantly downregulated expression of antigen presenting-related chaperones in NALM6-PTPN21lkcells. Our results uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that PTPN21-CDSlongand CDSshortisoforms may play opposite roles in NK-mediated killing in ALL cells， and showed that the endogenous PTPN21-CDSlongisoform inhibited ALL cells to NK cell-mediated lysis by regulating the KIR-HLA-I axis.Keywords:NK killing; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; human leukocyte antigens class I molecules; isoform; protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 21.
Comprehensive genomic profiling of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas identifies recurrent RAF fusions and frequent inactivation of DNA repair genes.,Cancer Discov, 2014 Dec,25266736,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266736/,Pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (PACC) account for approximately 1% (∼500 cases) of pancreatic cancer diagnoses annually in the United States. Oncogenic therapuetic targets have proven elusive in this disease， and chemotherapy and radiotherapy have demonstrated limited efficacy against these tumors. Comprehensive genomic profiling of a large series of PACCs (n=44) identified recurrent rearrangements involving BRAF and RAF1 (CRAF) in approximately 23% of tumors. The most prevalent fusion， SND1-BRAF， resulted in activation of the MAPK pathway， which was abrogated with MEK inhibition. SND1-BRAF-transformed cells were sensitive to treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. PACCs lacking RAF rearrangements were significantly enriched for genomic alterations， causing inactivation of DNA repair genes (45%); these genomic alterations have been associated with sensitivity to platinum-based therapies and PARP inhibitors. Collectively， these results identify potentially actionable genomic alterations in the majority of PACCs and provide a rationale for using personalized therapies in this disease.Significance:PACC is genomically distinct from other pancreatic cancers. Fusions in RAF genes and mutually exclusive inactivation of DNA repair genes represent novel potential therapeutic targets that are altered in over two thirds of these tumors.
An E2F7-dependent transcriptional program modulates DNA damage repair and genomic stability.,Nucleic Acids Res, 2018 May 18,29590434,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590434/,The cellular response to DNA damage is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome. Recent evidence has identified E2F7 as a key player in DNA damage-dependent transcriptional regulation of cell-cycle genes. However， the contribution of E2F7 to cellular responses upon genotoxic damage is still poorly defined. Here we show that E2F7 represses the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of genomic stability， both throughout the cell cycle and upon induction of DNA lesions that interfere with replication fork progression. Knockdown of E2F7 leads to a reduction in 53BP1 and FANCD2 foci and to fewer chromosomal aberrations following treatment with agents that cause interstrand crosslink (ICL) lesions but not upon ionizing radiation. Accordingly， E2F7-depleted cells exhibit enhanced cell-cycle re-entry and clonogenic survival after exposure to ICL-inducing agents. We further report that expression and functional activity of E2F7 are p53-independent in this context. Using a cell-based assay， we show that E2F7 restricts homologous recombination through the transcriptional repression of RAD51. Finally， we present evidence that downregulation of E2F7 confers an increased resistance to chemotherapy in recombination-deficient cells. Taken together， our results reveal an E2F7-dependent transcriptional program that contributes to the regulation of DNA repair and genomic integrity.
Development of a two-step protocol for culture expansion of human annulus fibrosus cells with TGF-β1 and FGF-2.,Stem Cell Res Ther, 2016 Jul 12,27405858,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27405858/,Background:Different biologic approaches to treat disc regeneration， including growth factors (GFs) application， are currently under investigation. Human annulus fibrosus (hAF) repair or regeneration is one of the key elements for maintenance and restoration of nucleus pulposus function. However， so far there is no effective treatment for this purpose. The aim of the present study was to investigate the response of hAF cells to different combinations of GFs， and develop a protocol for efficient culture expansion.Methods:hAF cells were harvested from degenerated disc tissues during surgical intervertebral disc removal， and hAF cells were expanded in a monolayer. The experiments were categorized based on different protocols with transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) culture for 14 days: group 1 had no GFs (control group); group 2 received TGF-β1; group 3 received FGF-2; group 4 received both GFs; and group 5 (two-step) received both GFs for the first 10 days and TGF-β1 only for the next 4 days. Cell proliferation， collagen， and noncollagen extracellular matrix (ECM) production and genes expression were compared among these groups.Results:At days 3， 7 and 10 of cultivation， groups 4 and 5 had significantly more cell numbers and faster cell proliferation rates than groups 1， 2， and 3. At 14 days of cultivation， significantly more cell numbers were observed in groups 3 and 4 than in group 5. The group 4 had the most cell numbers and the fastest proliferation rate at 14 days of cultivation. After normalization for cell numbers， group 5 (two-step) produced the most collagen and noncollagen ECM at 10 and 14 days of cultivation among the five groups. In group 5， ECM gene expression was significantly upregulated. High expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 was upregulated with FGF-2 on the different days as compared to the other groups. Annulus fibrosus cell phenotypes were only marginally retained under the different protocols based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction results.Conclusion:Taken together， the two-step protocol was the most efficient among these different protocols with the most abundant ECM production after normalization for cell numbers for culture expansion of hAF cells. The protocol may be useful in further cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches for disc regeneration.Keywords:Annulus fibrosus; Disc degeneration; FGF-2; Mitogen; Morphogen; TGF-β1; Tissue engineering.
CD32a is a marker of a CD4 T-cell HIV reservoir harbouring replication-competent proviruses.,Nature, 2017 Mar 23,28297712,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28297712/,The persistence of the HIV reservoir in infected individuals is a major obstacle to the development of a cure for HIV. Here， using an in vitro model of HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells， we reveal a gene expression signature of 103 upregulated genes that are specific for latently infected cells， including genes for 16 transmembrane proteins. In vitro screening for surface expression in HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells shows that the low-affinity receptor for the immunoglobulin G Fc fragment， CD32a， is the most highly induced， with no detectable expression in bystander cells. Notably， productive HIV-1 infection of T-cell-receptor-stimulated CD4 T cells is not associated with CD32a expression， suggesting that a quiescence-dependent mechanism is required for its induction. Using blood samples from HIV-1-positive participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy， we identify a subpopulation of 0.012% of CD4 T cells that express CD32a and host up to three copies of HIV DNA per cell. This CD32a+reservoir was highly enriched in inducible replication-competent proviruses and can be predominant in some participants. Our discovery that CD32a+lymphocytes represent the elusive HIV-1 reservoir may lead to insights that will facilitate the specific targeting and elimination of this reservoir.
YAP1 Mediates Resistance to MEK1/2 Inhibition in Neuroblastomas with Hyperactivated RAS Signaling.,Cancer Res, 2019 Dec 15,31672841,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31672841/,Relapsed neuroblastomas are enriched with activating mutations of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. The MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib delays tumor growth but does not sustain regression in neuroblastoma preclinical models. Recent studies have implicated the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivator protein YAP1 as an additional driver of relapsed neuroblastomas， as well as a mediator of trametinib resistance in other cancers. Here， we used a highly annotated set of high-risk neuroblastoma cellular models to modulate YAP1 expression and RAS pathway activation to test whether increased YAP1 transcriptional activity is a mechanism of MEK1/2 inhibition resistance in RAS-driven neuroblastomas. In NLF (biallelic NF1 inactivation) and SK-N-AS (NRAS Q61K) cell lines， trametinib caused a near-complete translocation of YAP1 protein into the nucleus. YAP1 depletion sensitized neuroblastoma cells to trametinib， while overexpression of constitutively active YAP1 protein induced trametinib resistance. Mechanistically， significant enhancement of G1-S cell-cycle arrest， mediated by depletion of MYC/MYCN and E2F transcriptional output， sensitized RAS-driven neuroblastomas to trametinib following YAP1 deletion. These findings underscore the importance of YAP activity in response to trametinib in RAS-driven neuroblastomas， as well as the potential for targeting YAP in a trametinib combination. SIGNIFICANCE: High-risk neuroblastomas with hyperactivated RAS signaling escape the selective pressure of MEK inhibition via YAP1-mediated transcriptional reprogramming and may be sensitive to combination therapies targeting both YAP1 and MEK.
Mycophenolate antagonizes IFN-γ-induced catagen-like changes via β-catenin activation in human dermal papilla cells and hair follicles.,Int J Mol Sci, 2014 Sep 22,25247578,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25247578/,Recently， various immunosuppressant drugs have been shown to induce hair growth in normal hair as well as in alopecia areata and androgenic alopecia; however， the responsible mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study， we investigate the influence of mycophenolate (MPA)， an immunosuppressant， on the proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and on the growth of human hair follicles following catagen induction with interferon (IFN)-γ. IFN-γ was found to reduce β-catenin， an activator of hair follicle growth， and activate glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β， and enhance expression of the Wnt inhibitor DKK-1 and catagen inducer transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2. IFN-γ inhibited expression of ALP and other dermal papillar cells (DPCs) markers such as Axin2， IGF-1， and FGF 7 and 10. MPA increased β-catenin in IFN-γ-treated hDPCs leading to its nuclear accumulation via inhibition of GSK3β and reduction of DKK-1. Furthermore， MPA significantly increased expression of ALP and other DPC marker genes but inhibited expression of TGF-β2. Therefore， we demonstrate for the first time that IFN-γ induces catagen-like changes in hDPCs and in hair follicles via inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling， and that MPA stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting GSK3β leading to increased β-catenin target gene and DP signature gene expression， which may， in part， counteract IFN-γ-induced catagen in hDPCs.
The Role of Specific ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters in the Acquired Resistance to Pyrrolobenzodiazepine Dimer-Containing Antibody-Drug Conjugates.,Mol Cancer Ther, 2020 Sep,32669316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32669316/,ntibody-drug conjugates (ADC) containing pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers are being evaluated clinically in both hematologic and solid tumors. These include ADCT-301 (camidanlumab tesirine) and ADCT-402 (loncastuximab tesirine) in pivotal phase II trials that contain the payload tesirine， which releases the PBD dimer warhead SG3199. An important consideration in future clinical development is acquired resistance. The aim was to generate and characterize PBD acquired resistant cell lines in both hematologic and solid tumor settings. Human Karpas-299 (ALCL) and NCI-N87 (gastric cancer) cells were incubated with increasing IC50doses of ADC (targeting CD25 and HER2， respectively) or SG3199 in a pulsed manner until stable acquired resistance was established. The level of resistance achieved was approximately 3，000-fold for ADCT-301 and 3-fold for SG3199 in Karpas-299， and 8-fold for ADCT-502 and 4-fold for SG3199 in NCI-N87. Cross-resistance between ADC and SG3199， and with an alternative PBD-containing ADC or PBD dimer was observed. The acquired resistant lines produced fewer DNA interstrand cross-links， indicating an upstream mechanism of resistance. Loss of antibody binding or internalization was not observed. A human drug transporter PCR Array revealed several genes upregulated in all the resistant cell lines， includingABCG2andABCC2， but notABCB1(MDR1). These findings were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot， and inhibitors and siRNA knockdown ofABCG2andABCC2recovered drug sensitivity. These data show that acquired resistance to PBD-ADCs and SG3199 can involve specific ATP-binding cassette drug transporters. This has clinical implications as potential biomarkers of resistance and for the rational design of drug combinations.
The miR-29 transcriptome in endocrine-sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells.,Sci Rep, 2017 Jul 12,28701793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28701793/,errant microRNA expression contributes to breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance. We reported that although tamoxifen stimulated miR-29b-1/a transcription in tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant breast cancer cells， ectopic expression of miR-29b-1/a did not drive TAM-resistance in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However， miR-29b-1/a overexpression significantly repressed TAM-resistant LCC9 cell proliferation， suggesting that miR-29b-1/a is not mediating TAM resistance but acts as a tumor suppressor in TAM-resistant cells. The target genes mediating this tumor suppressor activity were unknown. Here， we identify miR-29b-1 and miR-29a target transcripts in both MCF-7 and LCC9 cells. We find that miR-29b-1 and miR-29a regulate common and unique transcripts in each cell line. The cell-specific and common downregulated genes were characterized using the MetaCore Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis algorithm. LCC9-sepecific miR-29b-1/a-regulated GO processes include oxidative phosphorylation， ATP metabolism， and apoptosis. Extracellular flux analysis of cells transfected with anti- or pre- miR-29a confirmed that miR-29a inhibits mitochondrial bioenergetics in LCC9 cells. qPCR，luciferase reporter assays， and western blot also verified the ATP synthase subunit genes ATP5G1 and ATPIF1 as bone fide miR29b-1/a targets. Our results suggest that miR-29 repression of TAM-resistant breast cancer cell proliferation is mediated in part through repression of genes important in mitochondrial bioenergetics.
Effect of Baicalin on Transcriptome Changes in Piglet Vascular Endothelial Cells Induced by a Combination of Glaesserella parasuis and Lipopolysaccharide.,DNA Cell Biol, 2021 Jun,34029124,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34029124/,Glaesserella parasuiscauses porcine Glässer's disease and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces acute inflammation and pathological damage. Baicalin has antioxidant， antimicrobial， and anti-inflammatory functions. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key regulatory functions during bacterial infection. However， the role of lncRNAs in the vascular dysfunction induced by a combination ofG. parasuisand LPS during systemic inflammation and the effect of baicalin on lncRNA expression induced in porcine aortic vascular endothelial cells (PAVECs) by a combination ofG. parasuisand LPS have not been investigated. In this study， we investigated the changes in lncRNA and mRNA expression induced in PAVECs byG. parasuis， LPS， or a combination ofG. parasuisand LPS， and the action of baicalin on lncRNA expression induced in PAVECs by the combination ofG. parasuisand LPS. Our results showed 133 lncRNAs and 602 genes were differentially expressed when PAVECs were stimulated with the combination ofG. parasuisand LPS， whereas 107 lncRNAs and 936 genes were differentially expressed when PAVECs were stimulated with the combination ofG. parasuisand LPS after pretreatment with baicalin. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed the dominant signaling pathways triggered by the combination ofG. parasuisand LPS were the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway， phosphatidylinositol signaling system， and inositol phosphate metabolism. Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed the differentially expressed target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were related to each other. A coexpression analysis indicated the expression levels of the DELs were co-regulated with those of their differentially expressed target genes. This is the first study to systematically compare the changes in lncRNAs and mRNAs in PAVECs stimulated with a combination ofG. parasuisand LPS. Our data clarified the mechanisms underlying the vascular inflammation and damage triggered byG. parasuisand LPS， and it may provide novel targets for the treatment of LPS-induced systemic inflammation.Keywords:Glaesserella parasuis; LPS; baicalin; lncRNA; mRNA.
Machine learning identifies candidates for drug repurposing in Alzheimer's disease.,Nat Commun, 2021 Feb 15,33589615,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33589615/,Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have consumed a large amount of time and resources with largely negative results. Repurposing drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another indication is a more rapid and less expensive option. We present DRIAD (Drug Repurposing In AD)， a machine learning framework that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. DRIAD is applied to lists of genes arising from perturbations in differentiated human neural cell cultures by 80 FDA-approved and clinically tested drugs， producing a ranked list of possible repurposing candidates. Top-scoring drugs are inspected for common trends among their targets. We propose that the DRIAD method can be used to nominate drugs that， after additional validation and identification of relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker(s)， could be readily evaluated in a clinical trial.
Aberrant methylation-mediated downregulation of the LINC01554 gene accelerates the malignant progression and regulates the chemosensitivity of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,J Physiol Pharmacol, 2022 Apr,35988928,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35988928/,Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is diagnosed as a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis， the associated mechanisms still need to be further investigated. The LINC01554 gene is confirmed to participate in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma， but its role in LSCC has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the function and the potential mechanism of LINC01554 in LSCC， LINC01554 further was used as a molecular target for the diagnosis and molecular targeted therapy of LSCC. The microarray-based gene expression profiling of LSCC and its adjacent non-tumor tissue were used to identify the differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was applied to verify the expression levels of LINC01554 in tissue and LSCC cell lines. The DNA methylation level of the LINC01554 promoter was detected by the application of bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS)， and the bisulfite conversion-specific/methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (BS-MSP) method. The effect of LINC01554 on the proliferation， migration， and invasion of squamous cell carcinoma was assessed by MTS， wound healing， transwell， RT-qPCR， Western blot in vitro-cultured TU177 cells， and AMC-HN-8 cells. The microarray-based gene expression profiling identified the differentially expressed lncRNAs， including LINC01554， with downregulation in the LSCC tissue vs. normal tissue. The RT-qPCR verified the downregulation of LINC01554 in the LSCC tissue (P=0.0049) and LSCC cell (P=0.0020). The BGS and BS-MSP exhibited the hypermethylation level of the LINC01554 promoter， which mediated the downregulation of LINC01554. A gain-of-function experiment showed that LINC01554 inhibited the proliferation， migration， and invasion of TU177 and AMC-HN-8. Subsequently， LINC01554 overexpression was shown to decrease cell viability in TU177 and AMC-HN-8 cells treated with cisplatin. Our findings indicated that the aberrant methylation-mediated downregulation of LINC01554 promoted malignant progression and cisplatin resistance in LSCC， and LINC01554 may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for LSCC.
Morphologic effects of estrogen stimulation on 3D MCF-7 microtissues.,Toxicol Lett, 2016 Apr 25,26921789,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26921789/,In the development of human cell-based assays， 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture models are intriguing as they are able to bridge the gap between animal models and traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Previous work has demonstrated that MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells cultured in a 3D scaffold-free culture system self-assemble and develop into differentiated microtissues that possess a luminal space. Exposure to estradiol for 7 days decreased lumen formation in MCF-7 microtissues， altered microtissue morphology and altered expression of genes involved in estrogen signaling， cell adhesion and cell cycle regulation. Exposure to receptor-specific agonists for estrogen receptor alpha， estrogen receptor beta and g-protein coupled estrogen receptor resulted in unique， receptor-specific phenotypes and gene expression signatures. The use of a differentiated scaffold-free 3D culture system offers a unique opportunity to study the phenotypic and molecular changes associated with exposure to estrogenic compounds.Keywords:Estrogens; In vitro assays; Morphology; Morphometrics; Three-dimensional models.
B-type natriuretic peptide exerts broad functional opposition to transforming growth factor-beta in primary human cardiac fibroblasts: fibrosis， myofibroblast conversion， proliferation， and inflammation.,Circ Res, 2004 Mar 5,14726474,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14726474/,The natriuretic peptides， including human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)， have been implicated in the regulation of cardiac remodeling. Because transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is associated with profibrotic processes in heart failure， we tested whether BNP could inhibit TGF-beta-induced effects on primary human cardiac fibroblasts. BNP inhibited TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation as well as the production of collagen 1 and fibronectin proteins as measured by Western blot analysis. cDNA microarray analysis was performed on RNA from cardiac fibroblasts incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-beta and BNP for 24 and 48 hours. TGF-beta， but not BNP， treatment resulted in a significant change in the RNA profile. BNP treatment resulted in a remarkable reduction in TGF-beta effects; 88% and 85% of all TGF-beta-regulated mRNAs were affected at 24 and 48 hours， respectively. BNP opposed TGF-beta-regulated genes related to fibrosis (collagen 1， fibronectin， CTGF， PAI-1， and TIMP3)， myofibroblast conversion (alpha-smooth muscle actin 2 and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain)， proliferation (PDGFA， IGF1， FGF18， and IGFBP10)， and inflammation (COX2， IL6， TNFalpha-induced protein 6， and TNF superfamily， member 4). Lastly， BNP stimulated the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway via cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase signaling， and two mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors， U0126 and PD98059， reversed BNP inhibition of TGF-beta-induced collagen-1 expression. These findings demonstrate that BNP has a direct effect on cardiac fibroblasts to inhibit fibrotic responses via extracellular signal-related kinase signaling， suggesting that BNP functions as an antifibrotic factor in the heart to prevent cardiac remodeling in pathological conditions.
Roles of p53 and caspases in induction of apoptosis in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells treated with a methanolic extract of Nigella sativa seeds.,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2014,25520084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25520084/,Background:Nigella Sativa (NS) is an herb from the Ranunculaceae family that exhibits numerous medicinal properties and has been used as important constituent of many complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs). The ability of NS to kill cancer cells such as PC3， HeLa and hepatoma cells is well established. However， our understanding of the mode of death caused by NS remains nebulous. The objective of this study was to gain further insight into the mode and mechanism of death caused by NS in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.Materials and methods:Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were treated with a methanolic extract of NS， and a dose- and time-dependent study was performed. The IC50 was calculated using a Cell Titer Blue® viability assay assay， and evidence for DNA fragmentation was obtained by fluorescence microscopy TUNEL assay. Gene expression was also profiled for a number of apoptosis-related genes (Caspase-3， -8， -9 and p53 genes) through qPCR.Results:The IC50 of MCF-7 cells was 62.8 μL/mL. When MCF-7 cells were exposed to 50 μL/mL and 100 μL/mL NS for 24 h， 48 h and 72 h， microscopic examination (TUNEL assay) revealed a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis. Similarly， the expression of the Caspase-3， -8， -9 and p53 genes increased significantly according to the dose and time.Conclusions:NS induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells through both the p53 and caspase pathways. NS could potentially represent an alternative source of medicine for breast cancer therapy.
Microarray analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiling in response to 2-deoxyglucose， metformin， and glucose starvation.,Cancer Cell Int, 2022 Mar 19,35305635,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305635/,Background:Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Altering glucose metabolism and its effects on cancer progression and treatment resistance is an emerging interest in BC research. For instance， combining chemotherapy with glucose-lowering drugs (2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)， metformin (MET)) or glucose starvation (GS) has shown better outcomes than with chemotherapy alone. However， the genes and molecular mechanisms that govern the action of these glucose deprivation conditions have not been fully elucidated. Here， we investigated the differentially expressed genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cell lines upon treatment with glucose-lowering drugs (2-DG， MET) and GS using microarray analysis to study the difference in biological functions between the glucose challenges and their effect on the vulnerability of BC cells.Methods:MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 20 mM MET or 4 mM 2-DG for 48 h. GS was performed by gradually decreasing the glucose concentration in the culture medium to 0 g/L， in which the cells remained with fetal bovine serum for one week. Expression profiling was carried out using Affymetrix Human Clariom S microarrays. Differentially expressed genes were obtained from the Transcriptome Analysis Console and enriched using DAVID and R packages.Results:Our results showed that MDA-MB-231 cells were more responsive to glucose deprivation than MCF-7 cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response and cell cycle inhibition were detected after all three glucose deprivations in MDA-MB-231 cells and only under the metformin and GS conditions in MCF-7 cells. Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of DNA replication were observed with all three treatments in MDA-MB-231 cells and metformin-treated MCF-7 cells. Upregulation of cellular response to reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms resulted after metformin and GS administration in MDA-MB-231 cell lines and metformin-treated MCF-7 cells. Autophagy was induced after 2-DG treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells and after metformin in MCF-7 cells. Finally， inhibition of DNA methylation were observed only with GS in MDA-MB-231 cells.Conclusion:The procedure used to process cancer cells and analyze their expression data distinguishes our study from others. GS had the greatest effect on breast cancer cells compared to 2-DG and MET. Combining MET and GS could restrain both cell lines， making them more vulnerable to conventional chemotherapy.Keywords:2-deoxyglucose; Breast cancer; Glucose starvation; Hormone receptor-positive subtype; Metformin; Microarray; Triple-negative breast cancer.
Actomyosin contractility plays a role in MAP2 expression during nanotopography-directed neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells.,Biomaterials, 2015 Apr,25682157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25682157/,Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the capability of differentiating into different lineages based on specific environmental cues. We had previously shown that hESCs can be primed to differentiate into either neurons or glial cells， depending on the arrangement， geometry and size of their substrate topography. In particular， anisotropically patterned substrates like gratings were found to favour the differentiation of hESCs into neurons rather than glial cells. In this study， our aim is to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of topography-induced differentiation of hESCs towards neuronal lineages. We show that high actomyosin contractility induced by a nano-grating topography is crucial for neuronal maturation. Treatment of cells with the myosin II inhibitor (blebbistatin) and myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (ML-7) greatly reduces the expression level of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). On the other hand， our qPCR array results showed that PAX5， BRN3A and NEUROD1 were highly expressed in hESCs grown on nano-grating substrates as compared to unpatterned substrates， suggesting the possible involvement of these genes in topography-mediated neuronal differentiation of hESCs. Interestingly， YAP was localized to the cytoplasm of differentiating hESCs. Taken together， our study has provided new insights in understanding the mechanotransduction of topographical cues during neuronal differentiation of hESCs.Keywords:Cytoskeletal contractility; Focal adhesion; Mechanobiology; Nanotopography; Neuronal maturation; Pluripotent stem cells.
Triggering of p73-dependent apoptosis in osteosarcoma is under the control of E2Fs-pRb2/p130 complexes.,Oncogene, 2003 Jun 5,12789260,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12789260/,Mechanisms underlying multidrug resistance (MDR)， one of the major causes of cancer treatment failure， are still poorly understood. We selected the osteosarcoma MDR HosDXR150 cell line by culturing Hos cells in the presence of increasing doxorubicin doses and showed that it is crossresistant to vinblastine. Similarly to the Hos parental cell line， HosDXR150 cells present mutated p53， functionally inactivated pRb/p105 and wild-type pRb2/p130. Owing to p53 mutation， MDR-1 gene， codifying for P-glycoprotein， is upregulated. Evasion of apoptosis in HosDXR150 cells is only partially explained by drug extrusion because of P-glycoprotein overexpression. Analysis of gene expression level profiles showed that parental cell line undergoes apoptosis through an E2F1/p73-dependent pathway while its resistant variant evades it. This result can be explained by the presence of distinct E2Fs-pRb2/p130 complexes on the p73 promoter. Namely， in Hos p73 transcription is activated by E2F1-Rb2/p130-p300 complexes， while in HosDXR150 it is kept repressed by E2F4-Rb2/p130-HDAC1 complexes.
BCL-2 antagonism sensitizes cytotoxic T cell-resistant HIV reservoirs to elimination ex vivo.,J Clin Invest, 2020 May 1,32027622,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32027622/,Curing HIV infection will require the elimination of a reservoir of infected CD4+ T cells that persists despite HIV-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses. Although viral latency is a critical factor in this persistence， recent evidence also suggests a role for intrinsic resistance of reservoir-harboring cells to CTL killing. This resistance may have contributed to negative outcomes of clinical trials， where pharmacologic latency reversal has thus far failed to drive reductions in HIV reservoirs. Through transcriptional profiling， we herein identified overexpression of the prosurvival factor B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) as a distinguishing feature of CD4+ T cells that survived CTL killing. We show that the inducible HIV reservoir was disproportionately present in BCL-2hi subsets in ex vivo CD4+ T cells. Treatment with the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-199 was not sufficient to drive reductions in ex vivo viral reservoirs when tested either alone or with a latency-reversing agent (LRA). However， the triple combination of strong LRAs， HIV-specific T cells， and a BCL-2 antagonist uniquely enabled the depletion of ex vivo viral reservoirs. Our results provide rationale for novel therapeutic approaches targeting HIV cure and， more generally， suggest consideration of BCL-2 antagonism as a means of enhancing CTL immunotherapy in other settings， such as cancer.Keywords:AIDS/HIV; Adaptive immunity; Cellular immune response; Immunology; T cells.
Coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases in malignant mesothelioma as a rationale for combination targeted therapy.,J Thorac Oncol, 2011 May,21774103,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21774103/,Introduction:To identify new therapeutic approaches in malignant mesothelioma (MM)， we examined the expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the effects of specific RTK inhibitors and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin; the latter being of special interest in MM given the recent linkage between NF2 loss and mTOR activation.Methods:We performed a screen for mutated or activated RTKs in 14 MM cell lines and 70 primary tumors. Expression of phosphorylated RTKs was analyzed by Western blotting and a membrane-based antibody array in normal growth conditions and after treatment by specific inhibitors. MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were screened by sequencing. MET， hepatocyte growth factor， insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor， and EGFR expression were studied by Western blotting， immunohistochemistry， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay， and by Affymetrix expression microarrays.Results:Profiling of the phosphorylation status of 42 RTKs showed prominent coactivation of MET and EGFR in 8 of 14 (57%) MM cell lines. MET， EGFR， and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor were the main RTKs activated after mTOR inhibition and contributed to AKT feedback activation. Knockdown of MET by RNA interference inhibited not only the phosphorylation of MET but also that of EGFR. Conversely， stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor increased both phospho-MET and phospho-EGFR. The combination of PHA-665752 and the EGFR inhibitor， erlotinib， suppressed cell growth more than either agent alone in three of six cell lines tested. Finally， combinations of rapamycin and different RTK inhibitors were more active than either drug alone in 12 of 13 cell lines.Conclusion:Combination targeting of kinase signaling pathways is more effective than single agents in most MM.
The ERAD inhibitor Eeyarestatin I is a bifunctional compound with a membrane-binding domain and a p97/VCP inhibitory group.,PLoS One, 2010 Nov 12,21124757,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21124757/,Background:Protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has recently emerged as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Disruption of ER homeostasis results in ER stress， which is a major cause of cell death in cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib， an anti-cancer drug approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and Mantle cell lymphoma. We recently reported that the ERAD inhibitor Eeyarestatin I (EerI) also disturbs ER homeostasis and has anti-cancer activities resembling that of Bortezomib.Methodology and principal findings:Here we developed in vitro binding and cell-based functional assays to demonstrate that a nitrofuran-containing (NFC) group in EerI is the functional domain responsible for the cytotoxicity. Using both SPR and pull down assays， we show that EerI directly binds the p97 ATPase， an essential component of the ERAD machinery， via the NFC domain. An aromatic domain in EerI， although not required for p97 interaction， can localize EerI to the ER membrane， which improves its target specificity. Substitution of the aromatic module with another benzene-containing domain that maintains membrane localization generates a structurally distinct compound that nonetheless has similar biologic activities as EerI.Conclusions and significance:Our findings reveal a class of bifunctional chemical agents that can preferentially inhibit membrane-bound p97 to disrupt ER homeostasis and to induce tumor cell death. These results also suggest that the AAA ATPase p97 may be a potential drug target for cancer therapeutics.
Caveolae as a target to quench autoinduction of the metastatic phenotype in lung cancer.,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol, 2016 Mar,26573510,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26573510/,Purpose:Mevalonate pathway inhibitors are potentially useful chemotherapeutic agents showing growth inhibition and pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. The effects of statins and bisphosphonates on cancer growth are attributed to a reduction in protein isoprenylation. Post-translational modification and activation of GTPase binding Ras superfamily permit the recruitment of these signal proteins to membranes where they mediate the cancer phenotype. Here， the effects of three inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway and one specific inhibitor of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins were studied in both an ER-negative， Ras-inactive breast (MDA-MB-231) and lung adenocarcinoma (CaLu-1) cells in vitro.Methods:Treated cells were subject to genome-wide gene expression profiling. A gene subset was established so that the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) could be observed and compared with signalling protein shifts.Results:Within the subset， some genes normally up-regulated during EMT were asymmetrically reduced by a Δ-24 DHCR inhibitor in the lung cells. Signalling proteins associated with caveolae were down-regulated by this oxidoreductase inhibitor， while those associated with membrane rafts were up-regulated.Conclusions:This study decouples isoprenylation effects from cholesterol events per se. The data support a hypothesis that caveolae are abolished by Δ-24 DHCR intervention and it is revealed that these microdomains are vital EMT signalling structures for lung cells but not ER- and Ras-negative breast cells. When signalling by extracellular signals is quenched by removal of the hydrophilic conduit provided by caveolae， the transcriptome responds by moving the cellular identity towards quiescence.Keywords:Caveolae; Gene expression; Metastasis; Proadifen; Statins.
New treatment alternatives for primary and metastatic colorectal cancer by an integrated transcriptome and network analyses.,Sci Rep, 2024 Apr 16,38627442,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38627442/,Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is still in need of effective treatments. This study applies a holistic approach to propose new targets for treatment of primary and liver metastatic CRC and investigates their therapeutic potential in-vitro. An integrative analysis of primary and metastatic CRC samples was implemented for alternative target and treatment proposals. Integrated microarray samples were grouped based on a co-expression network analysis. Significant gene modules correlated with primary CRC and metastatic phenotypes were identified. Network clustering and pathway enrichments were applied to gene modules to prioritize potential targets， which were shortlisted by independent validation. Finally， drug-target interaction search led to three agents for primary and liver metastatic CRC phenotypes. Hesperadin and BAY-1217389 suppress colony formation over a 14-day period， with Hesperadin showing additional efficacy in reducing cell viability within 48 h. As both candidates target the G2/M phase proteins NEK2 or TTK， we confirmed their anti-proliferative properties by Ki-67 staining. Hesperadinin particular arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. IL-29A treatment reduced migration and invasion capacities of TGF-β induced metastatic cell lines. In addition， this anti-metastatic treatment attenuated TGF-β dependent mesenchymal transition. Network analysis suggests IL-29A induces the JAK/STAT pathway in a preventive manner.
Characterization of cellular pathways involved in glioblastoma response to the chemotherapeutic agent 1， 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) by gene expression profiling.,Oncol Rep, 1999 Mar-Apr,10023010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10023010/,The effectiveness of chemotherapy for human cancers is limited by pharmacokinetic parameters such as variation in metabolism and is determined by the cellular response. In this work， we aimed to gain a more holistic understanding of the molecular basis of glioma response to the DNA-alkylating agent 1， 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) by using a systematic approach: we investigated the expression of 588 genes with various cellular functions in a BCNU-resistant glioblastoma cell line and a BCNU-sensitive subline before and after treatment with BCNU. Our gene expression profiling revealed major differences in gene expression between these two cell lines， especially after treatment with BCNU. One striking example was that BCNU decreased the expression of six DNA-repair genes in sensitive but not in resistant cells. In sensitive cells， BCNU treatment resulted in the induction of two MAP kinase genes; this finding suggests that the specific response to BCNU in sensitive cells may involve the Jun kinase signal transduction pathway. After BCNU treatment， marked induction of tumor necrosis factor was detected only in sensitive cells， suggesting that tumor necrosis factor is a mediator of BCNU-induced cell death. Bcl-2 family members were not altered by BCNU in sensitive cells， suggesting that BCNU-induced cell death may be independent of the bcl-2 pathway. Results of the present study demonstrate that gene expression profiling may facilitate identification of cellular pathways associated with specific responses to chemotherapeutic agents and contribute to an understanding of the molecular basis of drug action.
A double-virally-inactivated (Intercept-solvent/detergent) human platelet lysate for in vitro expansion of human mesenchymal stromal cells.,Transfusion, 2019 Jun,30912158,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30912158/,Background:Pooled human platelet lysate (HPL) can replace fetal bovine serum (FBS) as xeno-free supplement for ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We evaluate here whether a double-virally-inactivated HPL (DVI-HPL) prepared from expired Intercept-treated platelet concentrates (PCs) and treated by solvent/detergent (S/D) can be used for MSC expansion.Study design and methods:Expired Intercept-treated PCs in 65% platelet (PLT) additive solution were pooled and subjected to a 1% tri-n-butyl phosphate/1% Triton X-45 treatment followed by soybean oil， hydrophobic interaction chromatography purification， and sterile filtration. Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were expanded for four passages in growth medium containing 10% DVI-HPL， I-HPL (from Intercept-PC only)， untreated HPL， and FBS. MSC morphology， doubling time， immunophenotype， immunosuppressive activity， and differentiation capacity were compared.Results:Expanded cells had typical spindle morphology and showed higher viability in all HPL conditions than in FBS. The DVI-HPL and FBS-expanded cells were morphologically larger than in I-HPL and HPL supplements. The cumulative population doubling was lower using DVI-HPL than with HPL and I-HPL， but significantly higher than using FBS. Immunophenotype was not affected by the supplements used. Immunosuppressive activity was maintained with all supplements. Differentiation capacity into chondrocytes and osteocytes was more effective in DVI-HPL but less toward adipocytes compared to other supplements.Conclusions:Human PLT lysate made from Intercept-PCs subjected to S/D treatment may be an alternative to untreated HPL and to I-HPL for BM-MSC expansion. This finding reinforces the potential of HPL as a virally safe alternative to FBS for clinical grade MSC expansion protocols.

Activation of non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway by Wnt3a is associated with differentiation fate determination of human bone marrow stromal (mesenchymal) stem cells.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2011 Sep 16,21875572,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21875572/,The canonical Wnt signaling pathway can determine human bone marrow stromal (mesenchymal) stem cell (hMSC) differentiation fate into osteoblast or adipocyte lineages. However， its downstream targets in MSC are not well characterized. Thus， using DNA microarrays， we compared global gene expression patterns induced by Wnt3a treatment in two hMSC lines: hMSC-LRP5(T253) and hMSC-LRP5(T244) cells carrying known mutations of Wnt co-receptor LRP5 (T253I or T244M) that either enhances or represses canonical Wnt signaling， respectively. Wnt3a treatment of hMSC activated not only canonical Wnt signaling， but also the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway through upregulation of several non-canonical Wnt components e.g. naked cuticle 1 homolog (NKD1) and WNT11. Activation of the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway by anisomycin enhanced osteoblast differentiation whereas its inhibition by SP600125 enhanced adipocyte differentiation of hMSC. In conclusion， canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling cooperate in determining MSC differentiation fate.
Scavenger receptor class A member 3 (SCARA3) in disease progression and therapy resistance in multiple myeloma.,Leuk Res, 2013 Aug,23537707,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23537707/,This study evaluates the role of scavenger receptor class A member 3 (SCARA3) in multiple myeloma (MM). SCARA3 expression was induced upon treatment with oxidative stressors (ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs). An epigenetic inactivation of SCARA3 was noted in MM.1S myeloma cells. Myeloma cell killing by dexamethasone and bortezomib was inhibited by up-regulation of SCARA3 while SCARA3 knockdown sensitized myeloma cells to the drugs. Clinical samples showed an inverse correlation between SCARA3 gene expression， myeloma progression， and favorable clinical prognosis. In MM， SCARA3 protects against oxidative stress-induced cell killing and can serve as predictor of MM progression and therapeutic response.

High hypoxia status in pancreatic cancer is associated with multiple hallmarks of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.,Front Immunol, 2024 Mar 6,38510243,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38510243/,Introduction:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)， the most common form of pancreatic cancer， is a particularly lethal disease that is often diagnosed late and is refractory to most forms of treatment. Tumour hypoxia is a key hallmark of PDAC and is purported to contribute to multiple facets of disease progression such as treatment resistance， increased invasiveness， metabolic reprogramming， and immunosuppression.Methods:We used the Buffa gene signature as a hypoxia score to profile transcriptomics datasets from PDAC cases. We performed cell-type deconvolution and gene expression profiling approaches to compare the immunological phenotypes of cases with low and high hypoxia scores. We further supported our findings by qPCR analyses in PDAC cell lines cultured in hypoxic conditions.Results:First， we demonstrated that this hypoxia score is associated with increased tumour grade and reduced survival suggesting that this score is correlated to disease progression. Subsequently， we compared the immune phenotypes of cases with high versus low hypoxia score expression (HypoxiaHIvs. HypoxiaLOW) to show that high hypoxia is associated with reduced levels of T cells， NK cells and dendritic cells (DC)， including the crucial cDC1 subset. Concomitantly， immune-related gene expression profiling revealed that compared to HypoxiaLOWtumours， mRNA levels for multiple immunosuppressive molecules were notably elevated in HypoxiaHIcases. Using a Random Forest machine learning approach for variable selection， we identifiedLGALS3(Galectin-3) as the top gene associated with high hypoxia status and confirmed its expression in hypoxic PDAC cell lines.Discussion:In summary， we demonstrated novel associations between hypoxia and multiple immunosuppressive mediators in PDAC， highlighting avenues for improving PDAC immunotherapy by targeting these immune molecules in combination with hypoxia-targeted drugs.Keywords:galectins; hypoxia; immune checkpoint; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); tumor microenvironment (TME).
z-Leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal induces apoptosis of human glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells by proteasome inhibition and mitotic arrest response.,Mol Cancer Res, 2009 Nov,19861404,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861404/,Gamma-secretase inhibitors have been proposed as drugs able to kill cancer cells by targeting the NOTCH pathway. Here， we investigated two of such inhibitors， the Benzyloxicarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (LLNle) and the N-[N-(3，5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT)， to assess whether they were effective in killing human glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells (GBM TIC) in vitro. We found that only LLNle was able at the micromolar range to induce the death of GBM TICs by apoptosis. To determine the cellular processes that were activated in GBM TICs by treatment with LLNle， we analyzed the amount of the NOTCH intracellular domain and the gene expression profiles following treatment with LLNle， DAPT， and DMSO (vehicle). We found that LLNIe， beside inhibiting the generation of the NOTCH intracellular domain， also induces proteasome inhibition， proteolytic stress， and mitotic arrest in these cells by repressing genes required for DNA synthesis and mitotic progression and by activating genes acting as mitotic inhibitors. DNA content flow cytometry clearly showed that cells treated with LLNle undergo arrest in the G(2)-M phases of the cell cycle. We also found that DAPT and L-685，458， another selective Notch inhibitor， were unable to kill GBM TICs， whereas lactacystin， a pure proteasome inhibitor， was effective although at a much less extent than LLNle. These data show that LLNle kills GBM TIC cells by inhibiting the proteasome activity. We suggest that LLNle， being able to target two relevant pathways for GBM TIC survival， may have a potential therapeutic value that deserves further investigation in animal models.
LncRNA NRAD1 regulates the triple-negative breast cancer transcriptome by miRNA biogenesis， localization， and predominately non-ceRNA interactions.,Sci Rep, 2025 Jul 23,40696096,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40696096/,Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presenting greater treatment challenges due to its aggressive disease progression. Understanding TNBC's unique cell signaling and gene expression profiles will reveal novel therapeutic strategies. Non-coding RNAs， including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)， have emerged as key regulators of gene expression and potential therapeutic targets. This study focuses on a TNBC-enriched lncRNA， non-coding RNA in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A pathway (NRAD1， previously LINC00284)， which promotes progression in multiple cancers. Our analysis reveals that NRAD1 is central to miRNA-mRNA networks in TNBC cells， mediating cancer-promoting gene expression changes. Fractionation studies showed that NRAD1 is primarily located in the nucleus and mitochondria， with some cytoplasmic presence allowing for transcript-specific competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions with miRNAs. However， NRAD1 primarily effects miRNAs independently of ceRNA activity， instead upregulating DICER (a miRNA biogenesis protein)， altering sub-cellular distribution， and reducing biogenesis of mitochondria-localized miRNA (i.e.， miR-4485-3p). These findings demonstrate novel regulatory interactions between the cancer-promoting lncRNA NRAD1 and miRNAs that alter gene expression in TNBC， expanding our understanding of regulatory lncRNA-miRNA effects， TNBC biology， and highlighting future therapeutic strategies for targeting non-coding RNAs.Keywords:Breast cancer; Gene-expression; LINC00284; Long non-coding RNA; NRAD1; Triple-negative; microRNA.
